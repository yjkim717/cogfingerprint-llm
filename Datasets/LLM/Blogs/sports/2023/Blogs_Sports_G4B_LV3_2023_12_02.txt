**The Unexpected Math of a Win**

You know that feeling when you finally nail a shot, a play, a race – you’ve put in the work and it *finally* pays off? I had that moment last month at the local cycling race. I’d been training for months, meticulously tracking my splits and power output. But after the race, the data felt…confusing. My calculated time didn’t quite match what I *felt* I’d achieved. 

It was a frustrating reminder that sometimes, the numbers don’t tell the whole story. Just like a Marriott points system can be tricky, sometimes our efforts don't translate perfectly into immediate reward. It’s a gentle lesson about trusting the process and recognizing that real progress often lies beyond the simple calculation.  It’s about the journey, not just the final score, right?
