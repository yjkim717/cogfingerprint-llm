It’s 2023, and as another NBA season wraps up, I keep thinking about those “what if” moments. What if the other team’s star wasn’t injured for Game 7? Would the confetti still have fallen for the champs? It’s a humbling reminder that a title isn’t just about skill—it’s also about luck and health. The best teams are often the last ones standing, but are they always the last ones truly healthy? It makes you appreciate the journey, not just the trophy.
