There’s something bittersweet about watching a streak end. For weeks, the PAC-12’s perfect 19-0 start to the 2023 season felt like a shared secret among us college football fans—a quiet pride in our conference’s resilience. Every Saturday, we held our breath, hoping the magic would hold.

And then, just like that, it was over. No fanfare, just a final score that broke the spell. It’s funny—you almost miss the tension once it’s gone. That undefeated run wasn’t just about records; it was a story we were all telling together. Now, as we turn the page, I can’t help but smile. All good things must end, but what a ride it was while it lasted.
