**The Ghosts of Missed Lag**

Let’s be honest, there’s a part of every golfer’s game that feels… elusive. For me, it’s always been lag. I’d watch pros effortlessly dial it in, and I’d *try* to replicate it, usually ending up with a flailing swing and a shot that barely made it down the fairway. 

This year, I really doubled down on trying to understand it. Hours spent scrolling through forums, watching videos, and, let’s admit it, a *lot* of frustrating trial and error on the course. I was particularly focused on short par 4s – those moments where a little lag could really make the difference. 

It’s humbling, you know? Realizing that sometimes the best advice isn’t a fancy technique, but simply feeling your way through the swing, trusting your instincts.  I’m still working on it, but those ghosts of missed lag are starting to fade a little.
