Remember the grind of last season? Every game felt like a heavyweight fight, our stars logging heavy minutes just to keep us in contention. You could see the wear and tear by the playoffs. It was sustainable, but just barely.

This year, with Porzingis in green, there’s a different vibe. It’s not just about adding another big name; it’s about changing the entire ecosystem of our offense. Think about it: for the first time in a while, we have a genuine third scorer who demands attention. Defenses can’t just swarm Tatum and Brown on every possession.

That gravity creates space. Beautiful, open, driving-and-kicking space. And that’s where our efficient role players—the Hausers, the Horfords spotting up—truly thrive. They’re not just role players anymore; they’re the engine that allows our stars to actually catch their breath during games. Smart minutes management isn’t just a coaching preference now; it’s a strategic advantage born from a deeper, more versatile roster.

Suddenly, the path through the regular season looks less like a brutal marathon and more like a well-paced run. We’re not just trying to out-talent teams; we’re building a system designed to be fresh when it matters most. And in 2023, that feels like the ultimate luxury.
