**The Sound of Disconnect**

Anyone else feel like sometimes, technology just…fails? I was halfway through watching the Wimbledon final last month – Federer’s return, you know – and the streaming froze. Just. Dead. Silence. It was infuriating.  

It reminded me of those old cassette tapes, the ones that would constantly skip and distort, ruining a perfectly good song.  It’s funny, isn't it? We’re surrounded by so much connectivity, yet moments of frustrating disconnect still happen. 

I tried restarting, checking my internet, the whole nine yards.  It was a small thing, really, but it took me right out of the moment. Makes you appreciate those seamless experiences, right?  Maybe we all need a little more patience – and a good old-fashioned record player – sometimes.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
