It’s 2023, and I’m deep into my Football Manager save, building a dynasty on a tight budget. But those pesky clauses—future fees, salary commitments, percentage cuts—are giving me spreadsheet fatigue. I keep wondering: why isn’t there a simple "net charges" calculator in-game?

Manually tracking partial transfers and add-ons feels like doing homework when I just want to enjoy the beautiful game. It’s a small detail, but in a world driven by data, shouldn’t our virtual dugouts be smarter? Maybe next year’s edition will finally automate the financial fine print. Until then, I’ll keep dreaming of a cleaner, clearer path to glory—one where my focus stays on tactics, not tedious math.
