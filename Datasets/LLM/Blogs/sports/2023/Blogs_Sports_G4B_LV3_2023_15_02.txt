It’s funny how certain routines become anchors. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over a mini-streak – watching every new movie from M. Night Shyamalan and Denis Villeneuve as soon as it hits theaters. It’s not about collecting them, really, but about experiencing each film in that immediate, shared space. 

There’s something about the theater viewings that elevates the story. Like a dedicated athlete pushing through a training cycle, I'm determined to keep this streak alive, a small, deliberate act of appreciating the craft.  It’s a quiet challenge, a little ritual in 2023, and honestly, it feels good.
