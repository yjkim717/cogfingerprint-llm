The Marvel Cinematic Universe stands at a curious crossroads, and the box office performance of *The Marvels* might be the clearest signpost yet. While many are quick to blame superhero fatigue or the film's content, the real culprit could be far more mundane: its title. In an era where branding is everything, "The Marvels" is tragically generic. It fails to evoke the specific, pulpy excitement of an *Iron Man* or the cosmic grandeur of a *Guardians of the Galaxy*. It feels less like a film title and more like a corporate placeholder, a symptom of a sequel naming strategy that has prioritized brand recognition over unique identity. This, combined with a palpable decline in public favor following a string of less-cohesive Phase Four and Five projects, created a perfect storm. Audiences weren't just rejecting a movie; they were shrugging at a name that promised more of the same, at a time when "the same" has lost its magic.

And here is a reflective blog post on sports for 2023.

It’s October 2023, and I just watched my team’s season effectively end with a fumbled snap on the one-yard line. The usual frustration bubbled up, but then something shifted. I thought about the journey—the hope of September, the nail-biters of October, the rookie who surprised us all.

This year, more than any other, I’ve realized that being a sports fan isn't really about the final score. It’s about the shared experience. It’s the group chat exploding after an impossible touchdown, the collective groan at a bad call, and the quiet hope we all nurture together. The wins are just the exclamation points in a much longer, richer story.

That fumble hurt, but it doesn't erase the memories we made along the way. The season’s "failure" somehow deepened my connection to the team and the friends I watch with. Funny how that works.
