There’s a moment in every fan’s journey when you have to face a tough truth, and for me, watching Jordan Poole this season has been exactly that. When he signed that extension, we all envisioned a seamless torch-passing, a dynamic guard ready to elevate the Warriors’ future.

But 2023 has told a different story. The flashes of offensive brilliance are still there, yet they’re too often overshadowed by lapses on defense and inconsistent play. It’s hard to watch, because you see the immense potential. With Steph and Klay’s championship window still open, every game is precious. The conversation has quietly shifted from development to a difficult reality: is a trade the necessary step?

It’s not about giving up on a player, but about honoring the urgency of a dynasty’s final chapters. Letting go is part of sports, a bittersweet acknowledgment that the mission—chasing rings—must come first.
