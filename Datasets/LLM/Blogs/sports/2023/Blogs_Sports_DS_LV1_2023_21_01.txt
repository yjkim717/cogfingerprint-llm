### The Weight of the Hype

It’s that time of year again. The 2023 preseason poll just dropped, and the familiar names are at the top: Georgia, Michigan, Ohio State. Seeing them there, neatly ranked, feels both comforting and incredibly daunting.

I can’t help but think about the weight those numbers carry. For the Georgia Bulldogs, that #1 spot is a target, a constant reminder to everyone else that they’re the team to beat. It’s a crown, but a heavy one. For the Michigan Wolverines and Ohio State Buckeyes sitting at #2 and #3, it’s a different kind of pressure—the gnawing feeling of being so close to the summit, with just one or two teams blocking the view.

These polls aren’t just predictions; they’re the starting gun for a thousand narratives. They fuel the hope in Ann Arbor, the expectation in Athens, and that fierce, relentless hunger in Columbus. As a fan, it’s thrilling. But I also remember seasons where the preseason darling stumbled out of the gate. The poll sets the stage, but the players, the coaches—they’re the ones who have to write the story. Let’s see if this script holds up.
