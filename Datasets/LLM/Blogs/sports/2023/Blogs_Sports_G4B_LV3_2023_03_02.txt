**The Comfort of a Gameday Thread**

There’s something uniquely comforting about scrolling through an NFL Reddit game thread on a Sunday. It’s not just about the game itself – Saints versus the Buccaneers, this week – but the collective energy of a bunch of fans all experiencing it together. I found myself lingering on a post dissecting the referee’s calls, then laughing at a thread about the uniform color scheme. 

It’s a little slice of community, really.  As 2023 rolls on, these digital spaces feel more vital than ever. It’s a reminder that even while watching the same game from different corners of the country, we’re connected by a shared passion.  Do you have a favorite gameday ritual or online space?
