As we hit the home stretch of the 2023 regular season, it’s wild to think how quickly fortunes can turn. Just a few weeks ago, Baylor looked like a real threat, but now they’re out of the conference title picture entirely. Meanwhile, Kansas holds their destiny with two games left—every possession matters. It’s a reminder that in the Big 12, nothing’s guaranteed until the final buzzer. What a ride for college basketball fans this year.
