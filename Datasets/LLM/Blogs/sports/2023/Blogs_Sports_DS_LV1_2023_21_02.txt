### The Unwritten Rules of the Top Three

It’s October 2023, and the air is starting to get that familiar crispness. For college football fans, that means one thing: the polls are starting to mean something. The early-season guesswork is over, and the true contenders are separating themselves from the pack.

Right now, according to the folks over at /r/CFB, that means Texas, Michigan, and Ohio State are sitting pretty at the top. And looking at that trio, you can’t help but see the different paths to greatness.

There’s Texas, the prodigal son finally returning. After years of "we're back!" chatter that felt more like a wish than a promise, they’ve stormed their way to the summit. It feels like a revival, a program shaking off the dust and demanding everyone remember their name. You can’t help but root for that kind of story.

Then you have Michigan and Ohio State. It’s almost a law of nature at this point. As the leaves turn, these two are inevitably near the top, locked in their eternal dance. They are the immovable objects, the blue-blood standard. Their presence feels like clockwork, a comforting—or terrifying—predictability that defines the Big Ten and the national landscape.

Seeing these three teams up there is a perfect snapshot of the sport. You have the triumphant return, the relentless rivalry, and the sheer weight of tradition. It’s a reminder that in college football, history is always being written, rivalries are always brewing, and every October Saturday feels like the most important one yet. Now, we just wait to see who blinks first.
