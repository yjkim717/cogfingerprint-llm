The whistle blew, and the stadium fell silent. My final game of 2023 was over. As I sat on the bench, watching the celebration for the other team, I wasn’t thinking about the score. I was thinking about the bus rides, the pre-dawn practices, and the teammate who became a brother after picking me up from a tough loss last season.

We didn’t get the championship ring, but we got something more durable. We learned that resilience isn’t built in the highlight reel moments; it’s forged in the quiet grind and the unwavering support of your team. That’s the real victory—the one that stays with you long after the cheers fade. It’s not about the trophy, but the family you build chasing it.
