Okay, here’s a blog post draft inspired by your summary, aiming for a conversational tone and around 96 words:

**Where’d Jacoby Go?**

It feels weird, doesn’t it? Seeing Jacoby disappear after his ESPN stint. I remember Bill Simmons practically championing him – the guy was a rising star. Now, I’m genuinely hoping *The Ringer* picks him up. There’s something about his sharp takes and that particular voice that’s just…golden. 

It’s a strange thing, watching talent shift and hoping for the best.  Anyone else feeling a little unsettled by this quiet fade-out? #sports # Jacoby #TheRinger #ESPN

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
