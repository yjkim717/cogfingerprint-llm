**The Unexpected Foul – And How to Fight Back**

You know those moments in a game where everything just feels…wrong? I had one recently watching my niece play volleyball. A clear shipping error – the jersey arrived weeks late, and the seller flat-rejected her return request. It felt like a frustrating, small-scale injustice. 

It made me think about how easily we can feel powerless, especially when dealing with online marketplaces like Vinted. But just like a good team rallies after a bad call, you have to push back! Don’t let a denied dispute derail you.  Knowing your customer service rights and being prepared to advocate for yourself is key – it’s about protecting your experience, just like a well-placed block in a volleyball match.
