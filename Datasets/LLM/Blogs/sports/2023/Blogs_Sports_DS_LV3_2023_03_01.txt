There’s something uniquely raw about Thursday Night Football under the lights—especially when it’s Week 16 and every play counts. I remember settling into my spot last year, watching the Saints and Rams face off at SoFi Stadium, both teams visibly battered by a long season. Key players were sidelined with injuries, and you could feel the tension. It wasn’t just a game; it was a testament to resilience. In those hard-fought moments, I saw more than athletes—I saw people pushing through pain, reminding me that sometimes, our biggest victories come when we’re not at full strength, but we show up anyway.
