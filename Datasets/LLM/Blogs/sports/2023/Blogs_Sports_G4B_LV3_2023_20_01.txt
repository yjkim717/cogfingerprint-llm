**The Frustrating Fizz of the Marble Run**

Remember that feeling when you’re totally absorbed in something, pushing your limits? I had that at the Jelly Marble Run event last weekend – and then… a tiny little snag. The scoreboard just wasn’t giving me the whole picture. It showed each run’s score, sure, but not the *total* score. 

It made me think about how important it is to have clear, immediate information, especially when you’re competing, even in a playful way. It’s like watching a baseball game – you instantly know the team’s standing.  A simple total would have made the whole experience so much smoother and more satisfying.  Maybe next year they’ll add a cumulative display!
