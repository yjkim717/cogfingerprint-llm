"Finding My Post Position Confidence"

As a 6'4" player in our local rec league, I've been working on dominating in the paint. However, I've been struggling with a mental block - being assertive and taking up space. Too often, I'm fronted by opposing big men, and I hesitate to make a move. It's like I'm frozen, unsure of how to react. I've realized that it's not just about physical strength; it's about being confident and assertive. Last night's game was a turning point. I made a conscious effort to be more aggressive, using my body to shield the defender and make a few crucial baskets. It wasn't easy, but the confidence boost was immense. I'm learning to trust myself in the post, and it's paying off. As I continue to work on my mental game, I'm excited to see how far I'll go.
