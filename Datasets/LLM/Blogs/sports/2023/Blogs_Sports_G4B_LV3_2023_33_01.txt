**The Day the Streak Died**

You remember that feeling, right? That almost untouchable sense of dominance? This year, the Pac-12’s 19-game undefeated streak – a truly remarkable run – just… vanished. It felt jarring, like a sudden shift in the air. It wasn’t just about one team losing; it was a reminder that in college football, anything can happen. 

Seeing that streak broken really got me thinking about the unpredictable nature of sports and how those seemingly unbreakable records can be so quickly challenged. It’s a humbling lesson, isn’t it?  #Pac12 #CollegeFootball #SportsNews
