It’s late February 2023, and here in the heart of the Big 12, the tension is palpable. Kansas is holding strong, that familiar name at the top of the standings with just four of us left in this grueling race. My mind keeps drifting to Baylor, a team I’ve cheered for all season, now staring down elimination. It’s a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can turn in a regular season. This chase for the conference title—it’s about more than just basketball; it’s a lesson in resilience.
