Looking back from 2023, the road to the 2024 NBA title already feels like a historic gauntlet. It’s not just about the superstar names on the marquee, but the collective will of entire teams forged in recent Finals battles. I can’t help but think the eventual champion won’t just win a title; they’ll have earned it by surviving a clash of titans, a true test of legacy for every player and franchise involved. What a journey it will be to witness.
