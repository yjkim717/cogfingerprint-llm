**The Ghosts in the Paint**

Okay, so Rec League basketball in 2023… it’s supposed to be fun, right? But honestly, sometimes it feels like a mental battleground. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a frustrating combination of things. Specifically, just *getting* to the post feels like a victory sometimes, but then I’m getting completely fronted by bigger guys. 

It’s messing with my focus – I’m losing my rhythm, struggling to read the court. I’m realizing how important the mental aspect is, beyond just the physical moves. I’ve been trying to work on assertiveness, really pushing my way into the lane when I see an opening. Still a work in progress, but even small improvements in my post position are making a difference.  Anyone else feel this way?
