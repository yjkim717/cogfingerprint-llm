I still remember the thrill of playing on a team in high school. We'd show up to practice every day, rain or shine, and work together towards a common goal. But as I grew older, I realized that just like a successful sports team, a successful company needs to find its own rhythm. Take PwC's new RTO policy, for instance. By introducing different office attendance requirements for hybrid and virtual employees, they're acknowledging that one size doesn't fit all. Just as a basketball team needs different players with unique skills, companies need to adapt to the diverse needs of their employees. As we navigate the world of remote work, it's refreshing to see companies like PwC experimenting with new approaches. Will it be a slam dunk or a missed shot? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure - the game of work is changing, and it's exciting to be a part of it.
