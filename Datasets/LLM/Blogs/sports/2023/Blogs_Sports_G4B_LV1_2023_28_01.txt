**The Soundtrack to Frustration**

Okay, so 2023 was supposed to be *the* year I finally got into listening to music while running. I downloaded Amazon Music Unlimited, hyped about the seamless experience. But honestly? It’s been a rollercoaster. Constant pauses, random skips, and the app just…hanging. It’s unbelievably frustrating when you’re trying to zone out and push yourself! 

I’ve tried troubleshooting on my Android phone, even restarting everything, but it’s persistent. It’s made me realize how much I rely on a smooth, uninterrupted audio experience – something we often take for granted. Maybe I'll stick to Spotify for now.  Anyone else battling tech glitches during their workouts?
