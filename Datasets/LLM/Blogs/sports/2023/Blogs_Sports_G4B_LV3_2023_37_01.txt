**The Playbook’s Gone Fuzzy**

It’s funny how you can get so used to a certain way of doing things, right? Like a favorite route to the gym, or a specific pre-game ritual. For a lot of athletes – and honestly, I think a lot of us in the working world – 2023 has felt a bit like that.  

I was watching my son’s little league team recently, and the coach kept changing the strategy mid-game. One minute we were running, the next we were passing. It was frustrating for everyone, including the kids. It felt like there was *uncertainty* about the plan. 

It’s similar to what I'm hearing about hybrid work – especially with companies like PwC shifting their approaches.  Lots of *frustration* stemming from vague guidelines and a lack of clear direction.  It's easy to feel lost when the *playbook* isn’t solid.  

Ultimately, though, you learn to adapt. You trust your teammates, you adjust your approach, and you keep playing.  Maybe that's the biggest lesson – finding a way to navigate the evolving rules, even when they're not entirely clear.
