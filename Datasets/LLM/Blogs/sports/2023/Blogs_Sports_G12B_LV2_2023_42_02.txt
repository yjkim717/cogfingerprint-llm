>## The Echo in Empty Seats

Something’s been on my mind lately, watching college hockey this season. It's not the on-ice action – that’s been thrilling as ever. It’s the *atmosphere*. I was reading about regional attendance numbers, and it struck me: Fargo was electric, a sellout every game. Meanwhile, Bridgeport was hovering around half-full, and Manchester… well, Manchester was struggling.

It really makes you think, doesn’t it? What fuels that passion? What makes a community rally behind a team? Is it tradition, proximity, or just that undeniable spark of local pride? It's a puzzle, and it reminds you how deeply connected sports are to the fabric of a place.
