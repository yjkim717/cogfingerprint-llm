## That Feeling When the Underdog Wins...

Remember that feeling? The breathless anticipation, the nervous energy, and then…*that* moment. This year, it's been the Colorado Rockies, surprisingly clinging to relevance. Growing up, my dad was a die-hard Rockies fan – through thick and thin. We'd spend summers glued to the TV, enduring frustrating seasons with equal measure of hope and disappointment.

This year, watching them play with a scrappy kind of heart, it's brought back so many memories. It's not just about the wins and losses, it's about that unwavering belief, that underdog spirit. It's a reminder that sometimes, the unexpected happens. And honestly, in a world that feels pretty chaotic lately, seeing a team defy expectations is a small, comforting victory. It makes you remember why we love sports in the first place, doesn't it? More than just games, they’re about stories, about hope, and about those moments that stick with you long after the final whistle.
