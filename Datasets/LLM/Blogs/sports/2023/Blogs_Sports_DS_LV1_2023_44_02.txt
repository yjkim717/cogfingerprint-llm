The impending closure of Lantern, a pioneering cannabis delivery service in Massachusetts, sends a sobering message through the industry. It’s a stark reminder that operating in a state-legal market doesn't shield businesses from crippling regulatory hurdles. The high costs of compliance and the complex patchwork of local rules create a landscape where even successful platforms can falter.

This moment also casts a shadow of uncertainty toward the future. Many local operators now watch the horizon with trepidation, fearing that federal legalization—often seen as the ultimate goal—could ironically be their undoing. The concern is that once interstate commerce is permitted, well-capitalized, multi-state corporations will flood the market, making it impossible for the local pioneers who built the industry to compete. The very freedom they fought for could price them out of existence.

It’s 2023, and I finally understand what my dad meant about sports being a constant in a changing world. This year, my own daughter started T-ball, all oversized helmet and fierce concentration. Watching her, I was instantly thrown back to the smell of fresh-cut grass and my first clumsy swing.

The players, the teams, the stats—they all evolve. But that core feeling? The lump in your throat during a tight game, the pure joy of a team high-five, the life lessons in every loss? That’s the timeless magic. It’s not about the score; it’s about the stories we live and eventually pass on. Some things, thankfully, never change.
