### The Real Victory Lap

It wasn't about the final score. After the last buzzer of our rec league championship echoed in 2023, that truth finally settled in my bones. We lost, by the way. A heartbreaker by two points.

For months, the goal was that plastic trophy. But standing there, sweaty and defeated, I looked at my teammates—Sarah, who juggled night shifts with practice, and Mike, our fifty-year-old point guard with dodgy knees. The real win wasn't a shiny object; it was the text chain that blew up every Tuesday confirming we were still showing up. It was the shared groans and the unexpected laughter after a brutal play.

That trophy will gather dust in someone else's cabinet. But the camaraderie, the commitment we showed each other week after week? That’s the victory that doesn't tarnish. It’s the personal championship we all earned just by choosing to be there, together.
