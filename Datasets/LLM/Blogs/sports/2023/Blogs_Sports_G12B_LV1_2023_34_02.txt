## The Ghosts of CFP Touchdowns Past

It's that time of year again – college football is in full swing, and the playoff picture is starting to sharpen. Watching these games, you can’t help but think about the legends who’ve already graced that playoff stage. I was digging around the other day and stumbled across some really interesting stats about College Football Playoff touchdown leaders, and it got me thinking about the evolution of the game.

Seeing names like Stetson Bennett, Joe Burrow, and Trevor Lawrence at the top of those lists is pretty wild. Bennett, leading the pack with a surprising number of touchdowns, really exemplifies how much the game has changed. He wasn't a five-star recruit, but he carved out a legacy in those high-pressure playoff moments. 

Then there's Burrow, the Heisman winner whose 2019 season with LSU was just… electric. And Lawrence, the generational talent who faced immense pressure from day one. It’s fascinating to compare their performances, not just in terms of raw numbers, but in the context of their teams and the eras they played in. 

These touchdown records aren't just about individual brilliance; they’re a snapshot of offensive philosophies and the increasingly pass-heavy nature of college football. It makes you wonder who the next name will be etched into that CFP touchdown leaderboard. Who will rise to the occasion and leave their mark on playoff history?
