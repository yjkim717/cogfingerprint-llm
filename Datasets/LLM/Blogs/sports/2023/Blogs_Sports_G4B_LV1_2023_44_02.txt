**The Ghosts of Green Rush Past**

Honestly, reading about Lantern shutting down hit me a little hard. It’s a stark reminder that the cannabis industry, even with all the buzz around legalization, is still navigating a *seriously* complicated path. Like, remember the early days of sports betting? That feeling of pushing boundaries, of seeing things change so fast? It’s kind of like that, but with weed. 

Lantern’s closure – those regulatory hurdles, the potential for federal legalization still feeling so distant – it makes you think about the long game. It’s not just about getting a product to the consumer; it’s about building a sustainable system.  Makes you appreciate the dispensaries that *are* still thriving, and hopeful for a future where things are a little less…opaque.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
