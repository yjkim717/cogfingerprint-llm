### The Unseen Assist

It’s 2023, and everyone’s obsessed with the highlight reel. The 60-yard touchdown pass, the game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer. We see the star, the one who puts the points on the board. But my mind keeps drifting back to a high school soccer game from fifteen years ago.

I wasn’t the striker who scored. I was the midfielder who, for one perfect moment, saw the entire field like a chessboard. I intercepted a lazy pass, took one touch to control the chaos, and with the next, sent a slicing through-ball that bypassed three defenders. It landed directly on my teammate’s foot for an easy tap-in.

The crowd roared for him. My stats sheet just showed an assist.

That’s the thing about balance in sports—and in life. The flashy finishers get the glory, but the game is often won by the unsung players who control the flow, who make the subtle, powerful moves that create opportunity. We celebrate the goal, but it’s the perfectly weighted pass that made it all possible. Sometimes, the most impactful power isn't in the final shot, but in the intelligence of the setup.
