There’s something special about Fridays in our running community—it’s the day we share the stories behind our favorite running photos. It’s not just about pace or distance; it’s the quiet moments, the golden light at sunrise, or that unexpected high-five from a stranger on a trail. In 2023, with so much of life happening through screens, these snapshots ground us. We post routes along rivers, through cityscapes, or up misty hills, each image a reminder of why we run: for connection, for clarity, for the sheer joy of moving together. Every photo says, "You’re not alone out there." And honestly, that feeling? It’s everything.
