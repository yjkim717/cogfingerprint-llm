## Back From the Sun, Back to the Grind (and a Rough Trials Night)

Okay, so I’m officially back from a glorious week soaking up the sun – jet lag is *real*, folks! But the biggest shock wasn't adjusting to the time difference, it was diving back into Crucible Trials. Seriously, it felt like I’d forgotten how to play. 

Every match was a crucible of frustration. I kept getting matched with… well, let's just say players who seemed to be on a different level. Is anyone else noticing some weird matchmaking changes? It felt far from flawless. Hoping it's just the rust shaking off, but tonight was a tough reminder that even a break can't shield you from the competitive grind.
