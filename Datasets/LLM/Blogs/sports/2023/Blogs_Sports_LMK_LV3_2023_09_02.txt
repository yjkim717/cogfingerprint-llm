As I unboxed my Acer Helios 300 gaming laptop, I was stoked to dive into the latest games. But, my excitement was short-lived when I noticed a slightly bent screen. It's frustrating when a â‚¬2000 investment doesn't meet expectations. Has anyone else experienced quality control issues with their gaming laptop?
