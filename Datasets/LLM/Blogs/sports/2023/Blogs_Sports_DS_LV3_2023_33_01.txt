There’s something electric about an undefeated streak—it feels like magic, like the rules don’t quite apply. For weeks, I watched the PAC-12 roll on, that 19-game run becoming part of the rhythm of the 2023 season. It was more than just numbers; it was a story of resilience, of a conference refusing to bend.

But sports, like life, have a way of keeping things real. The first loss came, as it always does, snapping that pristine record. And honestly? There’s a strange relief in it. Perfection is a heavy cloak to wear. Now, without the streak, there’s freedom—room to grow, to stumble, and to fight back.

Because it’s not the losses that define you, but how you rise after. The PAC-12’s story isn’t over; in many ways, it’s just getting interesting.
