## The Echo of the Crowd: What College Hockey Attendance Tells Us

Something about college hockey just *feels* different, doesn't it? I was diving into a Reddit thread the other day discussing regional attendance numbers from earlier this year (2023), and it really got me thinking. Fargo and Allentown were buzzing – packed houses! Bridgeport had a solid showing, but Manchester… well, there’s room for growth.

It’s more than just numbers, though. It's about the energy, the shared passion. Seeing those strong turnouts reminds you of the power of local teams, of the connection fans have with the Manchester Monarchs, Fargo Force, and others. Makes you wonder what we can all do to keep that excitement alive and bring more folks into the arena!
