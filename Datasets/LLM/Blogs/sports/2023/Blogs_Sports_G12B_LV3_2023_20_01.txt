## The Missing Piece: Why Marble Run Scores Matter (and What it Taught Me About Watching Sports)

Okay, I've been *really* into watching the JellesMarbleRuns wave events lately – the creativity is just mind-blowing! But something's been bugging me, and I saw another creator voice it too: the lack of a running total scoreboard. 

It's a small thing, I know, but it genuinely impacts the viewing experience. Without a clear sense of who’s leading and by how much, it's harder to get invested in the strategic choices people are making. You're just appreciating the build, which is fantastic, but a little scoreboard would elevate the tension and excitement! 

It made me think about other sports, too. Sometimes, it's not just about the final result, but the journey and the subtle shifts in momentum. Maybe we, as viewers, crave that ongoing narrative a little more than we realize. Food for thought, right?
