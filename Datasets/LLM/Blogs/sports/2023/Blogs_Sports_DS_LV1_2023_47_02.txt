There’s this moment in rec league when you realize it’s not just about height. I’m 6’5”, and for years, that was my entire game. But this season, guys started fronting me in the post, cutting off the entry pass before it even happened. At first, it was frustrating—a total mismatch against my own expectations.

I’d get in my head, overthinking every move instead of just playing. But 2023’s been my year of mental tenacity. I started focusing on footwork and sealing my defender, but more importantly, on staying present. If the pass isn’t there, I reset. I screen, I move. The game became less about forcing a score and more about reading the play.

Now, when I feel that pressure, I smile. It’s not a mismatch anymore—it’s a challenge. And honestly, that shift in mindset has made all the difference, on and off the court.
