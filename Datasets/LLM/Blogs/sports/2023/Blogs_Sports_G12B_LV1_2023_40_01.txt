## The Green Mile and a Lesson in Letting Go

Okay, so, St. Patrick's Day. It’s a day for parades, green beer (which, let's be honest, isn't *really* beer), and… running a 5K? Yep, that was my plan for March 17th, 2023. And it was… interesting.

I'd been training for a few weeks. Nothing super serious, mind you. A few jogs a week, trying to build up my endurance. My initial goal? Sub-32 minutes. Pretty ambitious for me, I know, but I was feeling good, the weather was cooperating, and I figured, why not? I even meticulously tracked my splits during training runs, obsessively trying to shave off those precious seconds. I had a spreadsheet, folks. A *spreadsheet* dedicated to my 5K aspirations.

The morning of the race dawned crisp and clear. The local park was buzzing with energy. So many people decked out in green – leprechaun hats, shamrock shirts, even a few full-on Irish costumes. The atmosphere was fantastic, a real sense of community and shared enthusiasm.  I felt a nervous flutter in my stomach as I lined up, trying to position myself somewhere near where I *thought* my pace would be.

The starting gun fired, and we were off. The first mile felt great. Really great. I was hitting my target split, feeling strong and in control. My spreadsheet-trained brain was ticking along nicely. "Keep this pace," it whispered. "You're on track!"

Then, mile two hit. And it hit *hard*.

Suddenly, my legs felt like lead. My breathing became ragged. That comfortable rhythm I’d established vanished. I started to slow down. A lot. The "keep this pace" voice in my head evolved into a panicked, "What's happening?! You're failing!"

I was fighting it. Really fighting it. I was mentally battling my body, trying to force it to do something it clearly didn’t want to do. I glanced at my watch, and my carefully planned splits were dissolving into a hazy mess of disappointment. Sub-32 was officially out the window.

And that’s when something shifted. I realized I was so focused on the *outcome* - that arbitrary number on the clock – that I was missing the point entirely. I was miserable, stressing myself out, and frankly, ruining what should have been a fun, celebratory morning.

I took a deep breath. I consciously slowed down *even more*. Instead of focusing on the time, I started to focus on my surroundings. I noticed the cheering crowds, the vibrant green decorations, the sheer joy on the faces of the other runners. I even managed a few smiles and a quick “Happy St. Patrick’s Day!” to the folks lining the course.

The last mile was still tough, don't get me wrong. But it was different. It wasn't a desperate struggle against my own body
