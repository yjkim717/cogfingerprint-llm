The Astros' Offseason Shuffle: A Look at Pitching Velocity Changes in 2023

As we dive into the new season, it's fascinating to see how the Astros' pitching staff has evolved over the offseason. With the help of Statcast data, we can take a closer look at the changes in pitch velocity and frequency for some of the team's key players. Let's start with Luis Garcia, who's made some notable adjustments to his arsenal.

According to the early 2023 Statcast data, Garcia has increased the velocity on his fastball by about a tick, averaging around 96-97 mph. This boost in speed has allowed him to throw more high-fastballs, making it tougher for hitters to anticipate his next move. It's a subtle change, but one that could pay dividends in the long run. Garcia's always been known for his ability to mix up his pitches, and this added velocity should only enhance his effectiveness.

Hector Neris is another Astros pitcher who's made some intriguing changes. Neris has been working on a new grip, which has resulted in a slightly slower slider. While it may seem counterintuitive to slow down a pitch, Neris is using this new grip to generate more spin, making his slider even more deceptive. The data shows that he's throwing this pitch more frequently, and it's been a key factor in his success so far this season.

It's not just Garcia and Neris who are making adjustments. Other Astros pitchers, like Cristian Javier and Ryan Pressly, are also tweaking their approaches. Javier has been working on a new changeup, which he's throwing more often in certain situations. Meanwhile, Pressly has been experimenting with a different arm angle on his curveball, making it harder for hitters to pick up the spin.

These changes might seem minor, but they can have a significant impact on a pitcher's performance. The Astros' offseason shuffle has been a deliberate effort to fine-tune their pitching staff, and the early returns are promising. As the season progresses, it will be exciting to see how these changes play out.

One thing is certain, though: the Astros are committed to staying ahead of the curve. With their focus on data-driven decision-making and a willingness to adapt, they're well-positioned to make a deep run in 2023. As a fan, it's thrilling to see the team innovate and evolve, and I'm eager to see how it all comes together.
