**The Time Dwayne Johnson Almost Became a Villain (Seriously)**

Okay, so I’ve been thinking a lot about wrestling lately, and something really stuck with me – specifically, Dwayne Johnson’s run as Hollywood Rock in WWE back in the early 2000s. It’s easy to remember him as the mega-movie star he is today, but this period feels like a fascinating, almost forgotten chapter. 

I’m starting to see it as a brilliant, contained “retrospective arc” of a heel turn. Think about it: a short, sharp period where he completely shifted his persona, embracing a genuinely nasty attitude. It wasn't a drawn-out saga, which, honestly, makes it way more compelling to look back on. 

It felt like a calculated risk, a little experiment that showcased a different side of him.  It’s wild to consider how a wrestler like Dwayne Johnson could completely reinvent himself within a single, focused storyline. Makes you wonder what other hidden gems are out there in wrestling history!
