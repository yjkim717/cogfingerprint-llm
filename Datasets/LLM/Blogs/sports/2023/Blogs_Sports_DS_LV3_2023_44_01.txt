It’s 2023, and I’m thinking about how much sports mirror life—the discipline, the partnerships, the trust. Then I see headlines about lawsuits like Cresco Labs and Terps over unpaid cannabis bills. It reminds me of a team I played on where one player stopped pulling their weight. Suddenly, the whole dynamic crumbled. Trust and accountability are everything, on the field and off. When someone drops the ball, everyone feels it. It’s a tough lesson in shared responsibility.
