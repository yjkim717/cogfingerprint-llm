The final buzzer of my high school basketball career still echoes sometimes. 2023 was the year I finally understood what my coach meant by “leave it all on the court.” For years, I thought it was just about hustle. Now, working a corporate job, I see the deeper truth.

It’s about having no “what ifs.” In that last game, we were down by two with seconds left. I took the final shot—a contested three. It rattled out. We lost.

For a long time, that miss haunted me. But this year, a strange peace settled in. I realized the victory wasn't in the swish; it was in the courage to take the shot. I left every ounce of my effort, my focus, and my heart on that polished floor. There was nothing more to give.

Now, facing big life decisions, I ask myself: am I leaving it all on the court? Whether it’s a project or a personal goal, that same standard applies. No regrets, just full commitment. Because even in a loss, you walk away knowing you were truly present for the fight.
