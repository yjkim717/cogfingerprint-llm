>## The Buzz is There, But Where's the Crowd?

Something felt off at the regional college hockey games this year. Fargo? Electric. Absolutely sold out, the energy palpable. You could feel the excitement buzzing before the puck even dropped. Then you jump over to Bridgeport, and it's… half full. A lot of empty seats, a quieter atmosphere. 

Manchester had similar struggles. You could tell the organizers were hoping for more, already talking about boosting attendance for the later rounds. It’s a reminder that passion for sports isn't always a guarantee. It's about creating the right atmosphere, making it an event people *want* to be a part of. Hopefully, the rest of the tournament will see a shift!
