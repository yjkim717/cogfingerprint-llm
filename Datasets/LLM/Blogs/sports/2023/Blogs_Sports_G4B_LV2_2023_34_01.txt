**The Ghosts of Seasons Past**

There’s something endlessly fascinating about looking back at college football seasons, isn’t there? I’ve been digging into some data lately – specifically, how teams stack up based on the number of years they’ve consistently delivered top-tier player performances. It’s not just about wins and losses, but about a sustained level of excellence.

The numbers show teams hitting 90%, 75%, and even 95% of their players earning high ratings. It makes you think about the legacy a program builds, not just in championships, but in developing talent. 

I was remembering my own college days, watching a team that seemed to *always* be churning out stars. It wasn't always about the flashy plays; it was the consistent, reliable performance across the board. That’s what creates a truly special, enduring program. 

It’s a reminder that success in college football – and frankly, in life – isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon of building something truly lasting. What seasons stick with *you* as a testament to consistent excellence?

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the summary (like player evaluation)?
