**The Battle in the Paint: When Height Isn't Enough**

I used to think being 6'4" was my golden ticket in the post. That was before I met Mike, a 6-foot wall of muscle who taught me a brutal lesson in humility.

Last night, it happened again. I’d get what I thought was deep position, but Mike’s low center of gravity was like a bulldozer. He’d wedge a foot in front of mine on the box out, and suddenly, I was sealed behind him, watching the ball and feeling utterly useless. My height meant nothing when I was playing in his shadow.

The frustration is real. You know you have the physical tools, but you’re being outworked by someone who understands leverage and desire better than you do. My coach pulled me aside and said, “It’s not about being taller; it’s about being smarter. Win the footrace to the spot. Use your length, not just your height.”

So, my 2023 resolution is a mental one: stop seeing a height advantage and start seeing a battle of angles and anticipation. The real estate under the rim is earned, not given, and I’m finally ready to start earning my keep.
