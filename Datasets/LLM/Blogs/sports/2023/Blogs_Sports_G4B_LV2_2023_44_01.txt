**The Uncomfortable Silence After the Game**

You know that feeling after a big game? The adrenaline’s pumping, the cheers are still ringing, and you’re buzzing with accomplishment… or maybe disappointment. But then, the silence hits. It’s a strange quiet, isn’t it? Like everyone else is processing something you haven’t quite articulated yet. 

I was thinking about this the other day after my little league team’s tough loss. We played our hearts out, but it just wasn’t enough. It reminded me of that awkward pause after a teammate misses a crucial shot – a moment of unspoken accountability. 

Sometimes, success doesn’t feel as good as it should, and failure stings a lot longer. It’s about owning those moments, both the wins and the losses, and figuring out what needs to change.  Just like Cresco Labs and those Massachusetts dispensaries, it’s time to address the situation head-on.
