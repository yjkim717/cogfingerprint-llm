"It's that time again - Photo Friday is back! As I scroll through the amazing running photos shared by our community, I'm reminded of the beauty of winter running in New Orleans. The misty mornings, the crisp air, and the vibrant cityscape all make for a perfect backdrop. This week, we're featuring some of the top posts from last week's Photo Friday, showcasing the diversity of our running routes and the creativity of our runners. From sunrise jogs along the Mississippi to mid-morning sprints through City Park, the photos are a testament to the joy of running in our city. A huge thank you to everyone who shared their photos - keep 'em coming! Let's celebrate the spirit of running together and inspire others to lace up and hit the pavement. Share your own running photos with us and you might just see them featured here next!"
