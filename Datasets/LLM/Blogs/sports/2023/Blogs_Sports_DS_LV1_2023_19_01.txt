### The One Rep You're Leaving in the Tank

I used to think I was smart. I’d finish my sets feeling strong, with a rep or two—okay, sometimes three—left in the tank. I was playing it safe, avoiding failure. I figured I was being efficient.

Then, in 2023, I stumbled on a meta-analysis that felt like a personal call-out. It suggested most of us are training way too conservatively, hovering around a paltry 53% of our 1RM. We’re so focused on leaving Reps in Reserve (RIR) that we’re reserving our own gains.

The message was clear: my "safe" training was the real risk. I was risking stagnation.

So, I changed the script. I started chasing that deep burn, the final rep that makes you question your life choices. The weight got heavier, the sets got harder, and the results? They finally showed up. My lesson wasn't just about muscle growth; it was about the mental shift. True growth, it turns out, begins at the edge of your comfort zone, right where you think you have nothing left.
