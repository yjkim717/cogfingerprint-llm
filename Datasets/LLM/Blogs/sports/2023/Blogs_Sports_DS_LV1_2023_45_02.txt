It’s 2023, and I can’t help but think about Joel Embiid’s playoff journey. Five series wins—that’s it for a player of his caliber. Every spring, we watch him battle through injuries and expectations, and I wonder: what if he were out West? Would he even have those hard-earned victories? It’s a tough question, but it speaks to the brutal reality of the NBA. For all his dominance, the playoff stage remains his ultimate test—and the conversation isn’t going away anytime soon.
