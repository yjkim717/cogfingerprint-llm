There’s something special about revisiting wrestling’s Ruthless Aggression era—it’s like opening a time capsule full of attitude, intensity, and unforgettable characters. For me, Hollywood Rock’s 2002-2003 heel run stands out as pure gold. I’ve been thinking lately about how OSW Review could bring that magic to life in their next arc, starting from his iconic return at Summerslam 2002 all the way through the explosive Backlash 2003 main event.

WrestleMania XIX was the peak, but it’s the journey that fascinates me. Rock’s transformation wasn’t just about slick promos and eyebrow raises; it was a masterclass in storytelling. In today’s wrestling landscape, where long-term arcs can feel rushed, looking back reminds me why patience and character depth matter. It’s not just nostalgia—it’s appreciating the craft. Maybe that’s what sports, or sports entertainment, is all about: moments that stick with you, years later.
