As I stepped off the court in 2023, I couldn't help but think of the parallels between a grueling basketball match and a nail-biting boss fight in Star Wars: Fallen Order. Just as Dagan Gera's intense battles test Cal's resolve, a tough opponent pushes me to my limits. And when I finally emerge victorious, I feel like I've tapped into my own 'force essence.' But I've often wondered, if I'd stopped short of 'crossing the beam' - or in this case, the finish line - would my energy be restored? The answer lies in the thrill of competition itself.
