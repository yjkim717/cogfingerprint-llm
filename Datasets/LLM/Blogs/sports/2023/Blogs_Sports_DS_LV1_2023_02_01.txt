P85 pizza oven is patiently waiting on its pallet, and I’ve already been browsing oven accessories online, dreaming of the perfect wooden peel to launch that first Neapolitan-style pizza.

In that moment, all the complex strategies and heated rivalries of professional sports faded away. It was a beautiful reminder of why we fall in love with the game in the first place: that simple, primal thrill of play. Sometimes, you need a six-year-old to show you the heart of sport again.
