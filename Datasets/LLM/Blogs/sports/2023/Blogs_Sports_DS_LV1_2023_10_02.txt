It’s 2023, and as a lifelong Warriors fan, I’ve been thinking a lot about windows. Steph Curry’s prime is a precious, open window for another championship—and it won’t stay open forever. That’s why my mind keeps circling back to Jordan Poole.

I remember his electric rise, the fearless shots that made us all believe he was the future. But this season has felt different. That massive contract extension seemed to shift something. The defensive lapses, the inconsistent effort—it’s not just a slump; it feels like a disconnect.

Watching Steph carry the team night after night is a masterclass in greatness. It also highlights the urgency. We can’t afford passengers. Poole’s trade value is still significant, and packaging it for a proven, two-way contributor could be the key to bolting that championship window open for one more run.

It’s a tough truth, but sometimes you have to trade a piece of your future to fully honor your present. For Steph’s sake, I hope the front office sees it that way, too.
