It’s 2023, and I’m that warrior on the field with a scattered build—part power, part finesse, but no real identity. I tried following pro training guides, tweaking my stats for speed or strength, yet nothing clicked. Then I picked up that unexpected playstyle, like a signature move, and suddenly the game felt fun again. It’s not about chasing someone else’s godrick-tier setup; it’s finding your own rhythm, your own incantations in the sport. Sometimes the best strategy is just playing from the heart.
