Of all the metrics we obsess over in the NFL—the 40-yard dash time, the vertical leap, the bench press—I stumbled upon one this past season that felt both utterly ridiculous and strangely profound. It was late 2023, and I was deep in a rabbit hole of Combine data, my eyes glazing over from spreadsheets of player heights and weights. That’s when I discovered a concept so beautifully absurd it cut through the noise: the AWANOL metric, a humorous analysis dedicated to determining the “fattest” and “skinniest” names in the league based on the physical width of their letters.

It started as a laugh. I pictured a scout with a ruler, meticulously measuring the "w" in "Brown" against the "l" in "Smith." But the more I thought about it, the more it became a reflection on identity in a sport that constantly tries to quantify the human body. We reduce these athletes to numbers on a jersey and stats on a screen, but their names are their own. They are the personal brands stamped onto the back of uniforms, echoing through stadiums on the voices of thousands.

So, I decided to play along. Let’s talk about the heavyweights, the names with serious mass and girth. Think of a name like "Quinnen." You’ve got that wide, stable "Q" leading the charge, followed by the double "n"s standing side-by-side like two immovable defensive tackles. It’s a name that sounds like it should belong to a man who clogs running lanes. Or "Mawae," a classic lineman’s name from years past. The "M" and "w" are the pillars, the "a"s are the foundation. You just know a guy named Mawae isn’t getting pushed around easily. These are the names with a low center of gravity, built from the ground up with broad, commanding letters. They have a certain *heft* to them, even before the player steps onto the field.

On the other end of the spectrum are the speedsters, the names that look like they’re already in motion. A name like "J.J."—just two vertical lines and two dots. It’s aerodynamic. It’s efficient. It’s the name of a player who is gone in a flash. Or consider "Hill." Sure, it denotes elevation, but visually? It’s all uprights: "H," "i," "l," "l." It’s a name that slices through the air, much like the receiver who bears it. These skinny names, built on "i's" and "l's," feel fast. They don’t take up much space on the jersey; they suggest a player who operates in the gaps, in the margins, where a single step can be the difference between a touchdown and an incompletion.

And then there’s the name size itself. The sheer length of a name like "Haason Reddick" versus the compact punch of "Pat Mahomes." The nameplate becomes a visual representation of their presence. Reddick’s name stretches across his shoulders, a long, relentless pass-rusher. Mahomes’s is concise, almost understated, belying the explosive, universe-bending talent contained within. It’s a reminder that impact isn’t always proportional to the space you occupy
