"Capturing the Journey, One Frame at a Time. As we lace up our shoes and hit the pavement in 2023, let's not forget to capture the moments that make running so special. Our weekly 'Photo Friday' feature on Reddit is dedicated to showcasing the beauty of running through the eyes of our community. Share your favorite running photos, whether it's a stunning finish line shot or a serene landscape captured during a solo run. Let's inspire and motivate each other to keep pushing forward, one step and one snap at a time."
