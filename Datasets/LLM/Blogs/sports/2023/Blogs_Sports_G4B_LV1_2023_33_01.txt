**The Ghost of 19-0**

It feels weird saying it, but 2023 was the year the Pac-12’s legendary undefeated streak finally died. Seriously, 19 straight wins? That’s a record that felt almost untouchable. I remember watching Oregon dominate, feeling that surge of confidence – it was intoxicating. Then, that one loss. It wasn’t just a game; it was a seismic shift. 

There’s a strange sadness attached to it, a feeling that something precious was lost. It’s a reminder that even in college football, with all its drama, there are moments that feel truly historic, and sometimes, they just slip away.  It’s a good thing to remember, even if it stings a little.
