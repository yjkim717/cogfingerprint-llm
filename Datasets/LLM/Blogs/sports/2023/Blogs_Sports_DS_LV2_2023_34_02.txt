It’s funny how time slips by—here we are in 2023, and I still find myself rewatching those electric College Football Playoff moments. Remember Joe Burrow’s surgical precision at LSU? Or Deshaun Watson’s iconic game-winning drive for Clemson? Those weren’t just plays; they felt like shared experiences, didn’t they?

Now, looking at Stetson Bennett’s journey from walk-on to two-time national champion at Georgia, it hits me: these quarterbacks aren’t just names in a stat column. Each touchdown tells a story—of pressure, resilience, and that rare magic under the brightest lights.

It makes me reflect on my own life—the moments where I’ve had to step up, even when no one was watching. Sports, in its raw honesty, mirrors our own struggles and triumphs. And maybe that’s why we keep coming back, year after year.
