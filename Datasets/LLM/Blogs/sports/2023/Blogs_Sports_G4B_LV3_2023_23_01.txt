It’s funny how sports can connect you to people you’d never expect. I stumbled across a story about Iowa State and West Virginia fans – a genuine alliance built on…softball and baseball shortages! Seriously. Both schools lack those teams, and fans started reaching out, finding common ground. It makes you think, doesn’t it?  We often get so caught up in our own “tribes,” forgetting that shared passion can forge unexpected friendships.  Maybe this bizarre connection is a reminder that sometimes, the most interesting relationships grow from the most unconventional roots.
