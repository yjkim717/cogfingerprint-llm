**The Weight of What We’re *Not* Lifting**

Okay, so I’ve been diving deep into some fascinating research lately, and it’s really got me thinking about my own training. This meta-analysis basically said that a surprising number of us lifters are…underdoing it. We’re often picking weights that are *way* too light, leaving a huge chunk of potential muscle growth on the table. 

It’s weird, right? We’re so focused on feeling good, on hitting a certain rep range, that we forget to really push ourselves. I’ve definitely been guilty of it myself – sticking to “comfortable” weights. But the data suggests that sometimes, stepping outside that comfort zone, even with a little self-selection and a brave attempt at a 1RM (one-rep max), is where the serious gains happen.  Maybe it’s time to challenge my limits!

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps write a post focused on a specific sport?
