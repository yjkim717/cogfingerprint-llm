**Is My Favorite Pitcher…Changing? The Weirdness of 2023 Pitching**

Okay, baseball fans, let’s be honest – this year has been *weird*. We’re drowning in data now, thanks to Statcast, and it’s revealing some seriously fascinating (and slightly unsettling) stuff about how pitchers are throwing. I’ve been glued to the numbers, and I’m starting to think our beloved pitchers aren’t quite the same as they used to be.

I’ve been particularly watching some of my favorite guys – Garcia, Neris, Maton, Blanco, and Urquidy – and it’s like they’re experimenting. Early reports are showing noticeable shifts in their velocity on certain pitches. Garcia’s fastball, usually a rocket, seems to be dipping slightly, while Neris is clearly playing with a new cutter. 

It makes you wonder, right? Are they trying new grips? Are they adjusting their mechanics? Or is it just a fluctuation we’ll see iron out over the season? 

It's a reminder that pitching isn't just about raw power anymore. It’s about deception, movement, and fine-tuning.  This data is showing us that even the most consistent pitchers are constantly adapting and tweaking their approach. It's a little unnerving, but also incredibly exciting to watch.  What do *you* think is driving these changes? Let's discuss in the comments!
