## The Silent Music Stop That Nearly Ruined My Run

It happened last week. Miles into my run, lost in the rhythm and pushing hard, my music just…stopped. Turns out, my downloaded playlist on my Garmin 265 had expired. Seriously? Mid-run! It was a jarring reminder that even our tech needs a little TLC. Now I'm setting up Wi-Fi reminders – a small change, but one that could save my next workout from a silent, frustrating halt. Anyone else had a similar tech hiccup while exercising?
