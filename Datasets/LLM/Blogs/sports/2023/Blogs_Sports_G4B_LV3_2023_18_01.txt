Input: Sports teach resilience.
Output: There’s something incredibly grounding about pushing through a tough practice or a losing game. Remember last fall, when I was convinced I’d never make the varsity soccer team? It felt impossible, like a huge, daunting construction project. But with consistent effort – a little ‘shedding’ of doubt, if you will – I kept building my skills. Turns out, resilience isn’t just for athletes; it’s a fundamental part of life.
