As I lace up my cleats in 2023, I'm reminded of my trusty Elden Ring warrior build from a few months back. Just like fine-tuning my Twin Blade-wielding, Bloodhound-stepping Tarnished, I've been perfecting my soccer strategy. My "build" now focuses on swift wingers and a stalwart defense, with Godrick-esque strength in the midfield. The results have been telling - we've conceded fewer goals than last season. It's amazing how the discipline and adaptability I've developed through gaming have translated to the pitch. Who knew that conquering the Lands Between would prepare me for conquering the league?
