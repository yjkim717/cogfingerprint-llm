It’s funny how small victories can feel monumental. I was watching a basketball game last week – a close one, full of tense boss fights (if they were players!). A guy missed a crucial shot, and for a second, I thought all that effort was lost, the XP beam (representing the momentum) wouldn’t appear. But then, he rallied, and got a force essence reward – a huge three-pointer! It reminded me that sometimes, it’s not about the initial score, but the comeback.
