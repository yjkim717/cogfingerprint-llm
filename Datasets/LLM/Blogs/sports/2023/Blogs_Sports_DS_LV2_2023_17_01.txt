The final whistle blew on my high school soccer career last month, and honestly? I feel a bit lost. For four years, my identity was "midfielder"—I knew my role, my position, and my teammates like the back of my hand. Now, in the quiet of the 2023 offseason, that structure is gone. It’s like I’ve mastered one playstyle, but the game is over. I’m left scrolling through college recruitment sites, wondering what my next "build" should be. Do I focus on pure speed, or develop a more technical game? The uncertainty is daunting, but it’s also the first real play I get to call entirely for myself.
