There’s something special about Tuesdays in the fall, especially if you’re a college football fan like me. It’s not just about looking back at Saturday’s upsets or looking ahead to next week’s rivalries—it’s about that weekly ritual we’ve come to love: Trivia Tuesday. In 2023, with so much noise in the sports world, these little moments of connection and competition feel more meaningful than ever.

Every Tuesday morning, I grab my coffee, open the app, and dive into the CFB trivia questions. It’s not just a random quiz—it’s a battleground. There’s the Premier Tier, where the heavy hitters flex their knowledge, and then there’s the Baba O’Riley Leonard Championship Tier, named with that quirky, inside-joke energy that makes college football so human. I’m not gonna lie, I’m gunning for that top tier. But it’s not just about knowing which team pulled off an impossible Hail Mary in 1998 or who holds the record for most rushing yards in a single game. It’s about that rush—the speed bonus.

See, answering correctly is one thing, but answering *fast*? That’s where the magic happens. My heart races a little, my thumb hovers, and for a few seconds, I’m not just a fan on my couch—I’m in the game. I’ve yelled at my screen more than once after missing the bonus by half a second. My wife just shakes her head, but she gets it. It’s the same thrill we feel when our team breaks away for a last-minute touchdown.

And then there are the standings. Watching my username climb (or, let’s be real, sometimes tumble) through the leaderboard each week—it’s a quiet competition among friends and strangers. We’re all in this together, celebrating obscure stats and shared memories. In a world that often feels divided, these small, spirited contests remind me why I fell in love with sports in the first place: for the community, the stories, and those heart-pounding moments that make us feel alive.

So here’s to Trivia Tuesday—may your answers be quick, your knowledge deep, and your Tuesdays forever full of that sweet, sweet speed bonus.
