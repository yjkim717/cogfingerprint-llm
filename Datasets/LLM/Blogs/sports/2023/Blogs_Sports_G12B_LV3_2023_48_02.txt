## Is Ashra Just… Hard? Or Did Something Change?

Okay, fellow Mortal Kombat players, I need to vent. I've been *obsessed* with Ashra, her kit is so cool! But I’m hitting a wall trying to land this one air combo – it *should* be doable, right? I'm starting to wonder if she's been subtly nerfed in a recent patch. Or, maybe it's just me, stubbornly missing something. Anyone else wrestling with Ashra combos lately? Let's commiserate (and hopefully share some tips!) in the comments.
