**The Weight of a Crown: Looking Back at Power 5 Dominance in 2023**

You know that feeling when you watch a team just… *dominate*? Like they’re operating on a different level? This year, 2023, that feeling was pretty constant when watching the Power 5 conferences. Seriously, the numbers were staggering – championship teams with ridiculously high win percentages, and those conference titles felt truly earned. 

It got me thinking about the “CFP Era,” you know, since the College Football Playoff started. Back then, the chase for a national title felt sharper, more desperate. Now, with the Power 5 conferences so consistently strong, the path to that ultimate prize feels a little… different. 

I remember watching the [Insert specific Power 5 team example – e.g., Georgia’s] run last year. It wasn't just about winning; it was about a relentless pursuit of perfection, a commitment to that almost unbelievable win percentage.  It made you appreciate the pressure these teams are under – the expectation to consistently be at the top. 

Is this the new normal? Are we entering an era where the Power 5 truly *owns* college football? It's a fascinating conversation, and one I suspect we’ll be having for years to come. What do you think?
