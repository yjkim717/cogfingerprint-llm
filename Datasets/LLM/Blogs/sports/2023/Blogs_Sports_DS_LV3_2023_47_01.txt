There I was, standing at 6’4” in our men’s league last night, feeling like a giant who’d forgotten how to use his size. You’d think height alone would make me a force in the post, right? But I kept getting outmaneuvered by guys half a foot shorter.

It’s all about positioning and technique—lessons I’m learning the hard way in 2023. These stockier opponents don’t jump higher; they get lower, using quickness and leverage to disrupt my post position before I even think about making a move. Boxing out feels like trying to anchor a boat in a storm when they wedge underneath me, all center of gravity and grit.

I used to rely on my frame, but now I see it’s a dance of angles and anticipation. Every game humbles me, reminding that basketball isn’t just a game of inches—it’s how you use them. And honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way.
