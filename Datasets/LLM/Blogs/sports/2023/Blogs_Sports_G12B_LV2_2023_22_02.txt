## Beyond the Stats: Seeing the Player

This year, watching the [mention a specific sport/team - e.g., Women's World Cup, local basketball team], something's struck me beyond the scores and highlight reels. It's the *way* teams function. You see the star players, sure, but it’s the quiet ones, the ones supporting, encouraging, lifting others up – they're often the unsung heroes.

It reminded me of leadership in any field. Technical skill is vital, absolutely. But a truly great leader, whether on the court or in the office, needs something more. They need to *see* the people around them, understand their needs, and build them up. It’s about recognizing that every player, every team member, has something valuable to contribute, even if it’s not always visible in the box score. That's what makes a winning team, isn't it?
