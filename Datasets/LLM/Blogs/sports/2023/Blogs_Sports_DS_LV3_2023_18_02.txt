The whistle echoed through the stadium, the final buzzer of our 2023 championship dreams. On the bus ride home, the silence was heavier than any loss I’d ever known. We had the talent, the plays, the drive—so what went wrong?

Staring out the window, it hit me. All season, we’d focused on the flashy stuff: complex offensive sets, highlight-reel plays. We saw our struggles—the "purple leaves"—as a simple lack of intensity. But the real issue was deeper, a fundamental deficiency in our team chemistry, our trust.

It wasn't until that quiet moment I saw the "green inside the stem," the potential still alive. We weren't a lost cause. We just needed to stop treating the symptom and start nourishing the root. Next season, we’re rebuilding from the ground up, focusing on the unbreakable bond that truly wins games. The foundation, not just the finish.
