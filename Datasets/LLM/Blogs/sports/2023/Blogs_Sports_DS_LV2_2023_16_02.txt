There’s something about autumn that feels like coming home—the crisp air, the smell of fallen leaves, and the distant roar of a college football crowd on a Saturday afternoon. It’s 2023, and as I scroll through our Trivia Tuesday results and team standings, I’m struck by how much more this is than just a weekly contest.

I remember my first game as a freshman, wrapped in a cheap blanket, shouting myself hoarse for a team I’d only just started calling my own. Back then, I didn’t know a Cover 2 from a corner blitz, but I felt the energy—that collective breath held on third and long, the eruption when a running back broke free. It was raw, it was real, and it taught me that sports aren’t just about winning. They’re about belonging.

Now, seeing names in our Premier and Championship tiers—some of you dominating week after week, others fighting to climb—I see that same spirit. You’re not just playing for points; you’re sharing in a tradition. Maybe you’re a recent grad holding onto campus memories, or a lifelong fan passing that passion to your kids. Either way, you get it.

So whether you topped the leaderboard last week or are still chasing that breakthrough, remember: every piece of trivia, every nail-biting matchup, is another thread in this tapestry we’re weaving together. Here’s to the thrill, the camaraderie, and the stories we’ll tell long after the season ends.
