"Improving My Golf Swing: The Elusive Lag. As I stepped onto the course in the summer of 2023, I couldn't help but feel a mix of frustration and determination. My golf swing had been a work in progress for months, and I was fixated on mastering the elusive 'lag.' I'd spent hours devouring YouTube tutorials and experimenting with different techniques, but results were inconsistent. Without formal lessons, it was a trial-and-error process, but I was driven to crack the code. Lag, I learned, is crucial for generating compression and unleashing power through the club head. As I practiced, I began to notice subtle improvements â€“ a fraction of a second delay between the club shaft and my hands, and a more satisfying ball strike. It's a journey, not a destination, and I'm excited to see where my newfound understanding takes my game."
