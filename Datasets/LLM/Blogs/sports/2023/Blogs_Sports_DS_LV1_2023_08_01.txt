It’s 2023, and watching Joel Embiid lately has been a revelation. With James Harden gone, the narrative was that Philly’s offense would sputter. Instead, Embiid is orchestrating it himself—dishing out a cool 7 assists a night while keeping turnovers in check. It feels like we’re witnessing his game evolve in real time. He’s not just a scoring titan anymore; he’s a playmaker, silencing doubts and reshaping his legacy one smart pass at a time.
