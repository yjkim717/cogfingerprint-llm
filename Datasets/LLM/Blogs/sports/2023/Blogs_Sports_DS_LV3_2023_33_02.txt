The morning air in my grandfather’s house always smelled of coffee and old leather. He’d sit in his worn armchair, a relic from the 1970s, with a notepad on his knee, scribbling down scores and stats from a bygone era of college football. He’d tell me stories of the mythical, undefeated teams of his youth—how rare they were, how each one felt like a comet streaking across the sky. "You’ll never see four of them at once," he’d say, shaking his head. "That just doesn’t happen."

I think about him every time this season rolls around. But this year, 2023, feels different. It feels like the season he told me was impossible.

We are witnessing something historic, something that has redefined the very landscape of the College Football Playoff era. For the first time, as we barrel toward the conference championships, we have not one, but *four* undefeated Power 5 teams. Let that sink in. Four programs, from the hallowed grounds of the Big Ten, SEC, and beyond, have navigated the gauntlet of a modern college football season without a single blemish. Their collective win percentage is the highest we’ve ever seen at this stage. This isn't just a good year; it's a statistical anomaly, a perfect storm of talent, coaching, and perhaps a little bit of magic.

My grandfather’s world was one of regional pride. Your team was your identity, and an undefeated season was a local legend, a story to be passed down. Today, in the CFP era, it’s a national obsession. Every Saturday is a referendum. Every game is dissected on a thousand screens. The pressure is immense, a constant, grinding weight that has broken so many promising teams in Novembers past.

Yet here they stand. These four titans have shouldered that weight. They’ve faced the trap games, the rivalry chaos, the injuries, and the relentless scrutiny. They haven’t just won; they’ve dominated, building a collective record that feels less like a standings table and more like a monument to excellence.

It makes this year’s championship weekend feel less like a playoff precursor and more like a coronation of the regular season itself. We’re not just figuring out who’s the best; we’re celebrating the fact that we got to witness a level of sustained greatness that we were told was a relic of the past. The path to the national title has always been narrow, but this year, it’s paved with the perfection of four teams that refused to lose.

I wish I could call my grandfather and tell him. I’d say, "You were wrong. It does happen." The comets aren't just streaking; they're forming a constellation, and we all have front-row seats to the show. This isn't just a championship chase; it's a piece of history, unfolding right before our eyes.
