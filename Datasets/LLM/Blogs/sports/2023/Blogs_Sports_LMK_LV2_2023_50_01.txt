"As I pounded the pavement on my morning run in 2023, I was pumped to have my favorite tunes streaming from my Garmin watch. But, to my dismay, the downloaded music had expired, and I was left with an awkward silence. A frustrating Wi-Fi connection mishap had left me music-less. As I navigated the rest of my run, I couldn't help but think - why not a simple reminder when downloaded content is about to expire? A small feature that could make a big difference for runners like me, reliant on our trusty Garmin watches."
