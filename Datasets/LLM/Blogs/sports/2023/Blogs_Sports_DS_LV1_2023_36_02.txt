Of all the things to obsess over in the NFL—quarterback ratings, defensive schemes, fantasy sleepers—I never thought I’d find myself down a rabbit hole about… letter width. But here we are. It’s 2023, and in an era dominated by AI and analytics, I found a strange sort of comfort in the beautifully absurd, human-centric metric a fellow blogger dubbed “AWANOL.”

The premise is gloriously simple, yet it captivated me for an entire afternoon. The idea is to measure the “fatness” or “skinniness” of a player’s name based on the physical width of its letters. You assign a value to each character—an ‘m’ is wide and portly, an ‘i’ is slender and lean—and tally them up. The result is the AWANOL (Average Width Analysis of Names, On-Line) score. It’s the kind of project that has no real-world application, and that’s precisely what makes it so wonderful.

I decided to run the numbers myself, diving into the current 2023 rosters. The results were a delightful mix of the predictable and the utterly surprising. On the “fattest” end of the spectrum, you find names built like brick walls. Names like “Bamm” or “Komm” (thankfully, not real players, but you get the idea) would dominate. In reality, I found my champions of girth in names like “Mason” and “Humphrey.” All those rounded ‘m’s, ‘o’s, and ‘p’s create a name that feels substantial, a name that sounds like it belongs to a guard who can clear a running lane just by announcing his presence.

Then, there are the skinniest names. These are the speedsters, the featherweights. Names like “Titi” or “Iiii” would be the theoretical pinnacle, but on a real roster, I found elegance in names like “Eli” or “Ike.” They are all vertical lines and minimal footprint, names that look like they could slip through the smallest gap in a defensive line. You half-expect these players to be kick returners or shifty slot receivers.

But this isn’t just a silly exercise in typography. Staring at these lists, I started to reflect on the identity of a name. We attach so much to them. A name like “Brock” feels solid, unyielding. A name like “Ty” feels fast and efficient. Is it a coincidence that we often find massive defensive tackles with names that sound like geological events, or lithe cornerbacks with sharp, single-syllable names? Probably. But it’s a fun narrative, a layer of personality painted onto these athletes before they even step on the field.

In a league that is increasingly dissected by cold, hard data—Next Gen Stats tracking a player’s speed to the hundredth of a second, complex algorithms predicting play calls—the AWANOL metric is a beautiful rebellion. It’s a reminder that football, at its heart, is a human story. It’s about personalities, quirks, and the sometimes-illogical connections we fans make with the players we watch every Sunday.

So next time you’re looking at a roster, take a moment to look past the 40-yard dash times and the vertical
