**Ranking Our Sporting Heroes: Beyond the Stats**

It’s easy to rank athletes by wins and records – LeBron’s career points, Serena’s Grand Slam count. But what about measuring true “knowledge” in a sports context?

Think about it: does a phenomenal quarterback *really* possess more “knowledge” than a dedicated coach who understands player psychology and game strategy?  It’s about recognizing the multifaceted skills and experience that contribute to success.  Maybe it’s time we expand our definition of a sporting hero beyond just the scoreboard.
