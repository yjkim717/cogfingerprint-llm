The College Football Playoff (CFP) era has brought a new level of excitement to the sport, and as we head into the conference championship games in 2023, it's hard not to be impressed by the dominance of the Power 5 teams. For those who may not be familiar, the Power 5 conferences - the ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC - have long been the powerhouses of college football, producing top-tier teams and talent.

As we look at the teams vying for a spot in the national championship, it's striking to see just how well the Power 5 teams have performed. In the CFP era, which has been with us since 2014, these five conferences have consistently produced the best teams. And this year is no exception. The teams currently competing in the conference championships have a spotless record, with not a single loss among them. 

It's a testament to the strength and depth of the Power 5 conferences that we've seen so many undefeated teams make it to this stage. The level of competition within these conferences is incredibly high, with top-notch coaching, talented players, and a level of dedication that's unmatched in other divisions. As a result, the teams that emerge from these conferences are often the best of the best, with the talent and grit to take on the best teams from around the country.

As we look ahead to the national championship, it's clear that the Power 5 teams will be well-represented. With their strong records and impressive performances, it's likely that we'll see at least a few of these teams competing for the top spot. And given their dominance in the CFP era, it's not hard to see why. The Power 5 conferences have a proven track record of producing championship-caliber teams, and 2023 is shaping up to be no exception. As the season comes down to the wire, it will be exciting to see which teams emerge victorious and make their mark on the FBS championship.
