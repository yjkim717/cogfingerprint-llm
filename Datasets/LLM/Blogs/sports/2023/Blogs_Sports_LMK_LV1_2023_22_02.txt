"Coaching a winning team isn't just about tactics - it's about understanding your players. As I watched the 2023 Women's World Cup, I realized that the most successful coaches were those who could empathize with their athletes. A good people manager in a technical team is no different. When interviewing candidates for a management position, I look for those who can put themselves in their team members' shoes. Can they understand the stress of a looming deadline or the frustration of a coding bug? Empathy is key to unlocking a team's true potential."
