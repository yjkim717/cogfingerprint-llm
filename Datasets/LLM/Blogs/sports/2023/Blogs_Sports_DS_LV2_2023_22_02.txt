That final buzzer in 2023 still echoes. We had the play, the perfect inbound pass. But in that split-second, I didn't look for the open shot. I saw my teammate, wide-eyed and frozen. The playbook said shoot; my gut said pass. He scored. We won. They call it court vision, but it's just empathy in high-tops. The best leaders, in sports or tech, don't just see the strategy—they see the person. That’s the real game-winning assist.
