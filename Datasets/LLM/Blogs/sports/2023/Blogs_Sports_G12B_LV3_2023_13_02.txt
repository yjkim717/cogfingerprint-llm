>## The Heartbreak of the Late Collapse, and What It Taught Me About Resilience

Okay, so I’m still a *little* raw from watching the [Insert Relevant Sports Team - e.g., Cubs] game last night. Down by just a few runs in the eighth, we had momentum, we had the energy…and then, poof. Complete collapse. It was brutal. I’m talking sinking-into-the-couch, questioning-all-my-life-choices brutal.

But as the disappointment faded, something else started to settle in. It reminded me a lot of how I feel sometimes playing Marvel Snap. You build a powerful deck, you’re stringing together wins, feeling unstoppable…and then a single bad draw, a perfectly timed counter from your opponent, and your entire strategy crumbles.

It’s frustrating, absolutely. But it’s also a lesson. Just like those discard decks in Marvel Snap – where you intentionally sacrifice cards to power up others, only to rebuild and strike again – sometimes you have to accept the losses to truly appreciate the wins. It's about resilience, about learning from the wreckage and coming back stronger. And hey, there's always another game, another season. Right?
