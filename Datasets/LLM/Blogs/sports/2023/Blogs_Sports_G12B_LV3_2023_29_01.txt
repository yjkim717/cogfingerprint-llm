## The Hunt for Comfort (and a Good Back!)

This year, I’m really prioritizing comfort in the ground blind. Spending hours patiently waiting for that perfect shot shouldn't mean battling a screaming lower back! My old hunting chair just wasn't cutting it. So, I'm on the hunt – literally and figuratively – for a swivel chair that’s both supportive and lets me easily scan the landscape. Anyone else deal with this? Recommendations welcome! Let's make this hunting season a comfortable one.
