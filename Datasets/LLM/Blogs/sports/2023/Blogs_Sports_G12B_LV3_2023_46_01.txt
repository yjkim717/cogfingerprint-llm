## The Weight of Expectation: Thinking About NFL Quarterback Draft Picks

It's 2023, and the NFL draft hype is already swirling. We obsess over who will be the next franchise savior, the guy who can instantly elevate a team. But looking back, it's fascinating to see the varied paths of those top-three draft picks – the guys who arrived with *so* much pressure. 

Andrew Luck’s name keeps popping up, doesn't it? He holds the record for pass attempts over multiple seasons, a testament to his sheer volume of work. Yet, his story also highlights the brutal reality of the position. So many promising careers – some long, some tragically short – show how quickly things can change. It makes you wonder: is the weight of expectation, the spotlight on these young quarterbacks, ultimately a help or a hindrance? It’s a question that continues to fascinate me as a football fan.
