**The Roar That Wasn't Quite There**

Remember last year? 2023 was packed with college hockey regionals, and I was really excited to catch a few. There’s something uniquely thrilling about a regional tournament – that feeling of high stakes, a concentrated burst of passion. But honestly, the attendance numbers were…uneven.
