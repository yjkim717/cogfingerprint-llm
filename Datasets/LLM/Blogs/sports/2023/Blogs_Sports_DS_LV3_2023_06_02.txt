Looking back at the 2023 NBA season, it’s impossible not to wonder: what if the Bucks hadn’t lost their star to that untimely injury? Or if the Nets and Raptors had stayed healthy through the playoffs? Even the Warriors, with their championship DNA, felt the sting of key players sidelined. Injuries don’t just shape games—they rewrite legacies. In a league where every possession counts, a single twist of fate can turn a surefire title run into a heartbreaking "what if." It’s a reminder of how fragile greatness truly is.
