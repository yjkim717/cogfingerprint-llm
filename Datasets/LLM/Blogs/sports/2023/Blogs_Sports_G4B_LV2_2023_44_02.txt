**The Unexpected Loss of a Favorite**

You know those teams you just *always* root for? The ones that feel like a constant, reliable presence? This year, it felt like that for me with Lantern, the marijuana delivery app. It was so easy, so convenient – a little bit of a hidden pleasure in the everyday. 

Then, the news dropped: they’re shutting down. Apparently, all sorts of regulatory headaches got in the way. It’s a weird feeling, like losing a familiar friend. It made me think about how fragile even the most established things can be, how quickly the landscape can shift.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, things we take for granted just… disappear.  Anyone else feel that pang of loss lately?

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or adjusting the length?
