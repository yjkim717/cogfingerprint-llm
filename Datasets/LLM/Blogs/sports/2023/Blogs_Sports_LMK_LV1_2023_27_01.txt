"Digging into the Astros' Early Season Pitching Trends"

As I dove into the 2023 Statcast data for the Houston Astros, I was excited to see how their pitchers were adjusting to the new season. With the ever-changing landscape of MLB, it's crucial to stay on top of trends and identify areas where teams are gaining an edge. For the Astros, a few names jumped out at me: Justin Verlander, Framber Valdez, and Bryan Abreu.

Let's start with Verlander, a veteran pitcher who's been around the block a few times. At 39 years young, he's still throwing heat, but the numbers tell an interesting story. According to Statcast, Verlander's average fastball velocity has ticked up slightly to 94.5 mph, a welcome sign considering his 2022 campaign was marked by a dip in velocity. Moreover, he's increased his cutter usage, now throwing it around 20% of the time. This added wrinkle has helped keep hitters off balance, as evident from the whiff rates on his fastball and cutter.

Framber Valdez, on the other hand, has been quietly dominating on the mound. His average fastball velocity has remained steady at around 93.5 mph, but what's caught my attention is the increased usage of his secondary pitches. Valdez has been mixing in his curveball and changeup more frequently, making him a more formidable opponent. The added diversity in his arsenal has made it tougher for hitters to anticipate what's coming next.

Bryan Abreu, the Astros' flamethrower, has been a revelation so far in 2023. His average fastball velocity has reached a career-high 98.2 mph, and he's been using it to devastating effect. Abreu's also thrown more cutters this season, which has helped him generate more swings and misses. With his electric stuff, it's no surprise he's been a key contributor out of the Astros' bullpen.

It's still early in the season, and these trends could certainly shift as the Astros continue to navigate the grueling MLB schedule. However, it's heartening to see these pitchers adapting and evolving their approaches. As the season unfolds, it'll be fascinating to see how these changes impact their performance and the team's overall success.

For now, it's a promising start for the Astros' pitching staff, and I'm eager to see what the rest of the season holds. Will they be able to sustain these trends and make a deep playoff run? Only time will tell, but the early signs are certainly encouraging.
