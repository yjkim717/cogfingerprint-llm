>Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided keywords (augmented reality, architecture, AR glasses, NFT interiors, craftsmanship) but framed within a sports context, maintaining a conversational tone and clear storytelling and set in 2023. I've tried to weave in a subtle connection to the original theme of blending physical and digital.

## The Ghost of the Game: Remembering the Stadium, and What's Coming Next

Man, does it feel like just yesterday I was at the old Memorial Stadium? I'm talking about *the* Memorial Stadium, the one with the ivy climbing the walls, the perfect angle for the home run hitters. It's been torn down for years now, replaced by a shiny, modern ballpark, and honestly, sometimes I miss it. 

It wasn't *better* objectively. It lacked the luxury boxes and the giant video screens. But it had a *feeling*. A history you could practically taste. You could feel the echoes of generations of fans cheering.

Lately, I've been thinking about how we preserve those memories.  Photos are great, videos help, but it's just not the same. Then I saw a demo of some new AR glasses – you point them at a spot, and it overlays historical images, stats, even recreations of past plays. Wild, right? 

It got me thinking. What if you could virtually walk through Memorial Stadium, feeling the weight of those bricks, seeing the ghosts of players past?  It's like a digital layer built on top of the physical space. Maybe the future of sports fandom isn’t just about the live experience, but about layering digital history onto it. It’s a strange thought, but maybe it’s the best way to keep those memories truly alive.
