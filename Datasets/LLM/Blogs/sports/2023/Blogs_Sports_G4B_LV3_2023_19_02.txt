**The Unexpected Chill: How Breathwork and Cold Showers Changed My Game**

Okay, so I’ve been diving deep into some pretty unconventional training lately, and honestly, it’s shifted something within me – both on and off the field. It started with cold showers – a total shock to the system, I’ll admit. But I was reading about breathwork and how it can increase lung capacity, and I thought, “Why not?” 

I started incorporating a few minutes of focused breathing before each workout, and paired it with those icy blasts. It’s weird, but it’s been building this incredible sense of calm, this heightened self-awareness.  I even started noticing something… strange.  My eyes, when I’m really focused, seem sharper, more intense – almost like I’m observing everything with a heightened clarity. People have been calling it “hunter eyes.” 

It sounds a little out there, I know. But it’s made me realize that pushing beyond discomfort, whether in the water or during a tough drill, can unlock unexpected benefits. It’s not about chasing a specific outcome, but about cultivating a deeper connection with my body and mind.  What unexpected practices have you found helpful this year?
