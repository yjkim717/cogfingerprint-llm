It’s 2023, and I’ve been thinking a lot about my time in the gym. For years, I followed the same comfortable pattern: picking weights that felt challenging but manageable, usually leaving a few reps in the tank. I thought I was being smart, avoiding burnout.

But recently, I dug into the data and had a humbling realization. Like many lifters, I was hovering around 53% of my 1RM. It felt safe, but my progress in both strength and muscle growth had quietly plateaued. I was stuck in a moderate rep range, going through the motions without pushing my limits.

It hit me—real growth happens at the edge of your capacity. By always holding back, I was cheating myself out of gains I’d worked so hard for. Now, I’m learning to embrace the discomfort of heavier loads. It’s not just about lifting more; it’s about believing I can. And that mindset? That’s where the true transformation begins.
