**The Elusive Feeling of a Pure Strike**

I’ll admit it—I spent most of 2023 chasing a ghost. Not just any ghost, but the feeling of that perfect, compressed strike; the one you see pros create where the ball seems to melt into the clubface for a split second before rocketing off the turf.

My mission was "lag." I devoured every online tutorial, trying to consciously force my hands to stay trailing the clubhead. The result? A series of clunky, unnatural swings and more than a few embarrassing shanks. I was thinking my way into a knot, trying to *manufacture* a feeling that should be an effect, not a cause.

The breakthrough came not from another video, but from forgetting the mechanics for a moment. I focused purely on starting my downswive with my hips and letting everything else follow—my arms, the club, all of it. Suddenly, there it was: a effortless whip, that delicious lag happening on its own, and the satisfying *thump* of a truly compressed iron shot. It turns out, the secret wasn't in my hands, but in getting out of my own head.
