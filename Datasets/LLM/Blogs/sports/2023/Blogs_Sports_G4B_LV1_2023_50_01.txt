**My Garmin Glitch and a Lesson in Letting Go**

Okay, 2023 was supposed to be *my* year for serious running. I finally got a Garmin watch – the shiny, connected kind – and was so excited about the music downloads. But last weekend, it happened. I was miles into a run, completely lost in the rhythm, and my watch just…didn’t remind me my music was about to expire. 

It was incredibly frustrating! It highlighted how reliant I’d become on the tech. I realized I needed to embrace the quiet moments, the scenery, and maybe even just *listen* to the sounds of my feet hitting the pavement.  Lesson learned: sometimes, disconnecting is the best connection.
