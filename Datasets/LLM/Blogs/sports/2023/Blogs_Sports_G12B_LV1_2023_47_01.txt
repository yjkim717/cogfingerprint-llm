>## Feeling Like a Statue Under the Basket? My Rebounding Wake-Up Call

Okay, let's be honest. Lately, my rebounding game has been…well, let’s just say it’s been a work in progress. We've been playing some really tough teams this season, and I’ve noticed a pattern: these smaller, stockier guys are absolutely *owning* the boards. They’re quick, they’re aggressive, and I'm often left feeling like a statue, watching them snatch rebounds right out of the air.

It hit me hard after last week's game. We were down by just a few points in the final minutes, and I completely missed a box out opportunity, allowing a crucial offensive rebound and a quick score. It was a real wake-up call. 

I realized I'd fallen into a passive trap. I was waiting for the ball to come to me instead of actively creating space. My positioning was sloppy, my seals weren’t strong enough, and I wasn’t anticipating the entry passes. It felt like I was reacting instead of dictating.

So, I've been diving deep into some film and really focusing on the fundamentals. We’re talking aggressive post positioning – getting that shoulder in, using my body to create space, and anticipating those passes. I’m working on those powerful seals and learning to box out with more intensity. It’s a grind, but I’m determined to be a more impactful rebounder. Hopefully, it’ll translate to some wins on the court! Wish me luck!
