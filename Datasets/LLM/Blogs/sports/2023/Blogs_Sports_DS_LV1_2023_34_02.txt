**The Numbers That Don't Tell the Whole Story**

Sitting here in 2023, looking over the latest CFP touchdown stats for star quarterbacks, I’m struck by a thought: these numbers are just the headline, not the full story.

We see a name, a number of touchdowns, and we make a snap judgment. But what about the ones that got away? I remember watching a quarterback throw for four touchdowns in a semifinal, a stat line that looks legendary in the record books. Yet, what sticks with me is the one interception he threw in the final minute—the play that truly defined the game, the one that doesn't have its own shiny column in the CFP statistics.

That’s the thing about sports; the raw data gives us a framework, but the real narrative is written in the moments between the numbers. It’s in the pressure of a playoff game, the weight of a jersey, and the single play that etches a memory far deeper than any stat ever could. The touchdowns tell you they were great, but the story tells you *why*.
