**Small Town, Big Game Nights**

It’s crazy how much a local sports bar can tell you about a place. Last fall, watching the high school football team take on their rivals, I noticed something interesting. The top-selling beers weren’t the fancy craft brews – they were the classic, familiar ones. And the meat platters? Forget about it – they were *flying* out.
