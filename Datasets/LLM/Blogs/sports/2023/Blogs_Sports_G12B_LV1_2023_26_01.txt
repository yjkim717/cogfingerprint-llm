## The Nuggets Trade That Still Bugs Me

Okay, so hear me out. Looking back at the Nuggets' championship run this year, I keep circling back to that trade they made a few years back â€“ sending out future draft picks. Don't get me wrong, winning a title is the ultimate goal. But as a Thunder fan, watching Denver thrive makes you wonder, "Could we have squeezed a little more out of that deal?" 

It felt like they were giving up a *lot* of future flexibility for what ultimately proved to be a championship window. Maybe it was worth it, but sometimes I think we could have walked away with even more assets, building a stronger foundation for the long haul. Just a thought!
