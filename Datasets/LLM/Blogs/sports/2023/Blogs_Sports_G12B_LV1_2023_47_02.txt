## The Post, the Front, and Finding Grit

So, rec league basketball. It’s supposed to be fun, right? A way to blow off steam after work, get some exercise, and maybe relive a little glory from high school. Lately, though, I’ve been finding myself… frustrated. I’m 6’4”, which in this league gets me slotted as the “big guy,” and I’m spending a surprising amount of time battling opponents who just *front* me in the post. 

Seriously, every time I try to establish position, someone’s right in my face. It’s not malicious, I don't think. Just… relentless. Initially, it threw me off. I’d get flustered, take rushed shots, and generally play tighter than I should. 

This week, I had a moment. After another frustrating possession where I was boxed out completely, I just stopped. Took a breath. And realized something: this isn't about skill, not entirely. It's about *tenacity*. It’s about refusing to let that little bit of pressure break my focus. 

I’m still working on it, obviously. But I’m trying to meet that front with a stronger mental game. A little more grit. A little more willingness to fight for that inch. It’s a reminder that even in a casual game, the mental side of sports is everything. And honestly, that's a lesson that applies way beyond the court.



Hope this resonates! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
