There’s something about sports that transcends the game itself—it’s the stories, the tension, the shared moments. I was reminded of this recently while watching Jelle’s Marble Runs, of all things. In their Wave event, the score display only showed per-run points, not the cumulative total. It felt jarring, like watching a championship game with no scoreboard.

That tiny detail pulled me out of the experience. It made me realize how much we rely on those numbers to connect—to feel the stakes, to celebrate comebacks, to understand the journey. Whether it’s marbles or March Madness, clarity matters. In 2023, with so much vying for our attention, the little things in presentation can turn spectators into believers. Sports, at its heart, is about shared emotion—and sometimes, it’s the scoreboard that lets us feel it together.
