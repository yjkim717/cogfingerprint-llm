**The Sticky Moment That Made Me Question Everything**

Okay, let’s be honest – Zwift is amazing. Seriously. It’s like a virtual cycling club that fits in your living room. But I recently had a tiny, frustrating moment that reminded me that even the slickest tech can have a little hiccup. 

I was getting into the flow of a virtual ride last month when I hit a snag attaching my Bianchi to the trainer. Suddenly, there was this awful grinding noise and a noticeable resistance. It felt…wrong.  I started troubleshooting, and it quickly pointed to a potential problem with my rear derailleur and the cassette on my bike. 

It was a strangely humbling experience.  I’d taken my bike for granted, assuming everything just *worked*.  That little resistance forced me to really examine the connection, to understand how all the pieces had to align. It made me realize that even in the digital world of Zwift, a solid foundation – a properly matched drivetrain – is absolutely crucial.  Sometimes, the biggest gains come from paying attention to the details, right?
