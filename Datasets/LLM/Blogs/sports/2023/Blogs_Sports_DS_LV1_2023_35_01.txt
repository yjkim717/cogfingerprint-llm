There’s something special about the photos we take on the run—not the polished race-day shots, but the quiet ones from daily routes. Last Friday, scrolling through our community’s Photo Friday entries, I paused at a sunrise shot over a misty trail. It wasn’t just a picture; it was a story of discipline, of early mornings and personal victories.

In 2023, we’re so focused on pace and PRs that we forget why we started. These snapshots bring us back—the dew on the grass, a familiar hill conquered, the shared nod with another runner. They’re reminders that running isn’t just about the finish line; it’s about the journey, the small moments that keep our hearts in the sport. What’s your favorite running memory captured on camera?
