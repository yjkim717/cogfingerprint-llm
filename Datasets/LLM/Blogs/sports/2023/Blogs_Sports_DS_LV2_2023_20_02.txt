That 2023 season was a rollercoaster. We started with championship dreams, hit a mid-year slump that felt endless, and somehow clawed our way to a respectable finish. Looking back, I’d title the disastrous losing streak in that stark, dramatic “Oppenheimer” font—all serious weight and consequence. But our final, gritty victory? That deserves the joyful, pink “Barbie” font, a celebration of pure, unexpected fun. It’s funny how a single season can hold two such different stories. You just have to appreciate the journey.
