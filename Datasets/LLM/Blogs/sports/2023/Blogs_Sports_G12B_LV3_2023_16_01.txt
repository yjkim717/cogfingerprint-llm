## More Than Just Scores: Why I'm Obsessed with College Football Trivia (and You Might Be Too)

Okay, confession time. I’m a college football fanatic. Always have been. The Saturdays in the fall? They're practically sacred. But this year, I've discovered a whole new layer of enjoyment, something that’s taken my obsession from just watching the games to *living* them – and it all revolves around a weekly trivia contest called 'Trivia Tuesday.'

I stumbled upon it almost by accident. A friend shared a link, a casual “Hey, thought you’d like this!” and I figured, why not? I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about the sport – I can rattle off Heisman winners from the last decade, debate the merits of different defensive schemes, and probably name more starting quarterbacks than I should. So, I figured I’d crush it.

Turns out, I was… wrong.

The first week was humbling. Questions ranged from the straightforward ("Who won the 2019 National Championship?") to the delightfully obscure ("What year did the first official college football game take place?"). And the speed bonuses? Forget about it! My brain felt like it was trying to run a 40-yard dash while simultaneously solving a complex equation.

But here’s the thing: I *loved* it.

It’s more than just answering questions. It's a deep dive into the history, the nuances, the forgotten moments that make college football so captivating. You start noticing things you never even considered before. Like, how many times has a team from outside the Power Five conferences made the National Championship game? (The answer, by the way, is more than you think!).

What’s really hooked me, though, is the tiered ranking system. It’s not just about getting the most questions right. It’s about consistently improving, climbing the leaderboard. There's a quiet thrill in seeing your name move up a few spots, knowing you’ve edged out the competition by a single correct answer. And there’s a real sense of community. We're all fans, we all get frustrated when we miss a question about a random kicker from 1987, and we all celebrate each other’s successes.

It's also a fantastic way to appreciate the sport in a different way. You're not just focused on the current season; you’re connecting with decades of tradition, legendary players, and pivotal moments. It’s like gaining a secret decoder ring for college football.

This year, I even convinced a few friends to join, and we’ve formed a little team. It’s become our weekly ritual – a chance to connect, debate, and test our knowledge. It adds another layer of excitement to Saturdays, and it’s a surprisingly engaging way to stay connected with the sport during the week.

So, if you're a college football fan looking for something new to fuel your passion, I highly recommend seeking out a trivia contest like 'Trivia Tuesday.' You might be surprised at how much you *don’t* know, and
