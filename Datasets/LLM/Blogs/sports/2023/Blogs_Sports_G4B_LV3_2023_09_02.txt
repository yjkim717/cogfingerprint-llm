It’s funny how something seemingly solid can suddenly feel… fragile. Like my old baseball glove – a trusty companion for years – started showing a worrying crease last season. It made me think about all the catches it’d taken, the games it’d witnessed. Just like that Acer Helios 300 with the bent screen, sometimes even the best things show signs of wear. It’s a reminder to appreciate the value, and maybe start planning for the next upgrade.
