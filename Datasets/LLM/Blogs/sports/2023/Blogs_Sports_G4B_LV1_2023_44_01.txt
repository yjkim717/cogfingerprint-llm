Okay, here’s a reflective blog post inspired by the Cresco Labs lawsuit and aiming for a conversational, storytelling tone, set in 2023:

**The U-Turn That Still Stings**

You know those games where you’re *sure* you’ve got it? Like, absolutely nailed it? I remember one high school football game in ‘18 – we were down by a point with seconds left, and I lined up for the winning field goal. I kicked it… and it sailed wide. Total gut punch.

It wasn’t just the loss; it was the feeling of being so close, then having it snatched away. It’s weird, but sometimes the biggest disappointments aren’t about winning or losing. Sometimes, they’re about the feeling of trust or agreement, like that Cresco Labs and Terps situation – a business deal gone sour. It makes you think about accountability and the ripple effect of unmet obligations.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, even when you think you’ve done everything right, things can still go sideways.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post on a different topic?
