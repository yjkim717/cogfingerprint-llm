The Crucible matchmaking this season has been brutal. Here I am, a consistent 2.5 KD player, watching my ELO plummet to 950. It’s 2023, and the new weapon changes were supposed to be exciting to test, but how can I experiment when every match feels like the championship finals? It’s a humbling reminder that sometimes, the system itself is the toughest opponent, forcing even skilled players back to the drawing board.
