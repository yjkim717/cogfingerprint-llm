### The Real Highlight Reel

I’ll be honest, 2023 was the year I fell back in love with sports, and it had nothing to do with a championship trophy.

It was a sweltering Tuesday in July. My daughter’s softball team, the “Thunderbolts,” was on a historic… 12-game losing streak. The outfield was a masterclass in distracted daisy-picking. But in the final inning, down by ten runs, our smallest player, Mia, finally connected with the ball. It was a squibbling grounder, but she ran to first base like she’d just won the World Series, a grin splitting her dusty face.

We lost. Again. But as we all rushed the field to celebrate her hit, I realized this was the point all along. It wasn't about the score; it was about the sheer, unfiltered joy of trying. That dusty, high-fiving chaos was a better highlight reel than any professional league could ever produce. Sometimes, you find the real win in the most unexpected places.
