### The Free Performance Hack I Found in My Shower

I’ll be honest, I started cold showers in 2023 mostly as a viral trend, a way to “win the morning.” What I didn’t expect was for my bathroom to become my most effective training ground.

That first blast of icy water is a primal shock. My instinct was to gasp and tense up. But I quickly learned that’s a recipe for misery. The real secret, I discovered, is to lean into it with a slow, deep belly breath. I’d focus on pulling the air down, feeling my diaphragm expand, and consciously willing a wave of inner body heat to my core.

After a few weeks, something clicked on the basketball court. Driving for a layup through a tough screen, I felt the same familiar panic—the gasp, the tension. But this time, my body knew what to do. I took a fraction of a second, filled my lungs completely with a calm belly breath, and felt that same inner warmth and focus settle in. My vision sharpened, my movements became efficient. I’d accidentally trained for composure under pressure.

It wasn’t just about lung capacity; it was about control. The cold taught me to breathe like a hunter, calm and focused even when the environment is anything but. It’s the cheapest, most powerful sports psychology hack I’ve ever found.
