As I stepped into the gym in 2023, I couldn't help but wonder if I was getting the most out of my strength training routine. A recent meta-analysis caught my attention, revealing that many lifters, like me, might be lifting with loads that are too light to maximize gains. The study suggested that to build strength and hypertrophy, we need to challenge ourselves with weights closer to our 1RM (one rep maximum). I reflected on my own weight selection and realized I often default to comfortable weights, rather than pushing myself to heavier loads. This new insight has made me rethink my approach to lifting. I'm now more intentional about selecting weights that will drive real progress. It's time to stop playing it safe and start lifting heavy â€“ my gains depend on it!
