**The Hum of the Hub and a Question of Fit**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2023 has been *the* year for indoor cycling. Zwift’s been a constant companion, and I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to a Zwift Hub. It was supposed to be a game-changer, right? More realistic power data, smoother transitions… the whole shebang. 

But for a few frustrating weeks, it wasn’t exactly a smooth ride. I was getting these weird, intermittent shifts on my rear derailleur, especially when I’d be pushing hard on the climbs. It was seriously messing with my Zwift experience. 

I dove down the rabbit hole, and it turned out the issue wasn’t the hub itself – it was the cog sizes! My hybrid bike uses a slightly different gear ratio than the trainer, and the mismatch was causing these hiccups. 

It was a really humbling reminder that even the newest tech needs to work *with* your existing gear. Sometimes, the biggest advancements come from understanding the fundamentals and making sure everything fits together properly.  It's easy to get caught up in chasing the shiny new thing, but a little bit of troubleshooting and a return to basics can often solve the problem.
