**Blog Post: Thinking About Spray Foam – Is DIY Insulation Right for You?**

Okay, let’s be honest, the winter of 2023 was brutal. Seriously brutal. I was shivering even *inside*, and it got me thinking about energy efficiency. I’ve been researching spray foam insulation, specifically closed-cell, and it’s fascinating. 

The idea of tackling attic insulation myself – a 500 sq ft space – feels a little daunting, but the potential savings are huge.  R-value is a key factor, of course, and I’m trying to understand how much different types offer.  It’s definitely a project that requires careful research and, honestly, a good dose of patience.  Is it truly a viable DIY project? I’m still digging into the details, but it's sparking a serious interest in making my home more comfortable and sustainable.

**The Unexpected Lesson in a Losing Game**

2023 was a year of frustrating losses for my local hockey team. We were talented, but just… couldn’t seem to click.  I found myself getting increasingly frustrated, analyzing every missed pass, every bad decision. Then, after a particularly tough game, my coach pulled me aside. 

He didn’t focus on the mistakes. Instead, he reminded me that sports – and life – aren’t always about winning. It's about the grit, the effort, the learning curve.  He said, “Focus on how you respond to adversity.” That simple shift in perspective completely changed my approach.  It wasn't about chasing victory, but about embracing the challenge and growing from each loss.  It’s a lesson I’ll carry with me long after the season ends.
