### The Outlier Vote: A Love Letter to the Mavericks of the AP Poll

Every Monday during the college basketball season, it’s the same ritual for me: I refresh the AP Poll page, not just to see who’s number one, but to hunt for the outliers. You know the ones—the voter who stubbornly keeps a plucky mid-major in their top 15, or the skeptic who slots the blue-blood favorite three spots lower than anyone else.

In 2023, with analytics and groupthink often dominating the conversation, these voters feel like a breath of fresh air. The consensus poll gives us the big picture, the safe, aggregated view of the sport. But it’s the individual ballots, the ones that break from the pack, that tell the real stories. They’re not just random deviations; they’re arguments. They’re a voter saying, "I saw something you didn't," or "I believe in this team's story when you've already written them off."

Tracking these mavericks throughout the season is its own kind of drama. Sometimes, their stubbornness looks prescient by March. Other times, they just look… stubborn. But their consistency, or lack thereof, is a reminder that sports aren't just played by algorithms. They’re experienced by people with biases, hunches, and loyalties. That human element, that beautiful, messy inconsistency, is what keeps me hitting refresh every single week. It’s the soul of the game, one controversial ballot at a time.
