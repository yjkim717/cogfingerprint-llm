## Remember When Running Was King? A Look Back at Football's Evolution

It’s wild, isn’t it? Watching college football in 2023 and seeing the sheer volume of passing plays. Every game feels like a potential shootout. But it wasn’t always this way. I was reminded of that recently while thinking about some classic football lore.

Specifically, I started thinking about the Wishbone and Option offenses of the 70s – the Darrell Royal and Roosevelt Leaks era. Oklahoma and Texas, in particular, were *defined* by their ground game. Those teams, the kind that churned out yardage with a relentless, punishing run. You wouldn’t have dreamed of seeing them throwing the ball 30-40 times a game. It just wasn’t part of the plan. Joe Washington, a phenomenal running back for Oklahoma, epitomized that era.

Thinking back to those days, it’s striking how drastically football has changed. The emphasis now is so heavily on the passing game, on spreading the field and exploiting mismatches through the air. It’s a product of rule changes, of athlete development, and of evolving offensive philosophies.

Sometimes, I miss the simplicity of it. The power and physicality of a team solely dedicated to wearing down the opposition with a dominant running attack. There was a certain grit and determination to it that feels a little different than the high-octane offenses we see today.

Don't get me wrong, I love the modern game – the innovation and excitement are undeniable. But it's always good to pause and appreciate how far we’ve come, and remember a time when running the football truly *was* king. It's a fascinating evolution to witness.
