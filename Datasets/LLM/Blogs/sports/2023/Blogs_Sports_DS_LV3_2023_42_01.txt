There’s something timeless about watching old game footage—especially from the 1973 season, when football felt like a gritty chess match played in the trenches. I stumbled upon highlights of the Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns running the wishbone offense, and it struck me how different the game was back then.

They barely passed the ball. Instead, it was all about the ground game: relentless, methodical, and built on trust and timing. Watching those option offenses unfold felt like seeing poetry in motion—every handoff and pitch a testament to discipline over dazzle.

In 2023, with spread offenses and air raids dominating the field, it’s easy to forget the beauty of that simplicity. But there’s a lesson there, I think. Sometimes progress isn’t just about what’s new—it’s about remembering what worked, what connected us to the heart of the game. Those teams didn’t just run the ball; they ran with purpose. And maybe, in our own lives, there’s power in revisiting the foundations that made us who we are.
