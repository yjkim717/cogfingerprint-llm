**The Spreadsheet Obsession: Why We Still Love Trivia Tuesday**

Okay, confession time: I’ve been spending way too much time staring at college football standings this week. It’s that time of year, right? The air is crisp, the leaves are changing, and suddenly, I’m completely consumed by the weekly trivia contest on Reddit. 

Seriously, “Trivia Tuesday” has become a weird, comforting ritual for me. It started as just a casual scroll through r/CollegeFootball, but now I’m meticulously tracking every point, every ranking shift. There’s something strangely satisfying about watching teams climb – or plummet – based on a few well-placed answers. 

I know, I know, it sounds a little obsessive. But it’s more than just the football itself. It’s the community, the shared frustration when you blank on a regional rivalry question, and the joy of shouting out the correct answer alongside a bunch of strangers who *also* love the game. 

This year, the tiered rankings are particularly intense. It's fascinating to see how these little contests actually subtly reflect the broader power dynamics in the conference.  It's a reminder that even in the grand scheme of college football, sometimes the most interesting stories are found in the details – and maybe, just maybe, in a well-organized spreadsheet.
