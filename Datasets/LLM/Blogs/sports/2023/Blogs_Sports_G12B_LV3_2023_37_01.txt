## The Unexpected Lesson from My Local League

Okay, let's be honest, I'm not exactly a star athlete. My glory days peaked with a slightly-above-average performance in elementary school kickball. But I love sports. I love the camaraderie, the strategy, the sheer *energy* of it all. That’s why I finally joined a local adult softball league this year – a big step for someone who usually prefers cheering from the sidelines.

And it's been...well, interesting. 

We’re a team of varying skill levels, ages, and backgrounds. And recently, there's been a bit of a shake-up in how the league is being managed. A new rule implementation, similar to how companies are navigating hybrid work models, has thrown everyone for a loop. Suddenly, there's this awkward period of figuring things out, of managers (our team captain, bless his heart) trying to clarify the “why” behind it all. It’s a lot like hearing about PwC’s new hybrid policy – everyone’s waiting for the departmental deep-dives to understand how it *really* impacts them.

It's frustrating, sure. But watching it unfold, I’ve realized something. Even with the confusion, the uncertainty, the occasional grumbles about the new rules, there's still a shared joy in just *playing*. We still high-five after a good hit, we still celebrate each other's successes. 

Maybe that’s the lesson. Even amidst change – whether it's a new work policy or a revamped softball league – finding the enjoyment in the shared experience, the connection with your team, is what truly matters. And maybe, just maybe, a slightly relaxed dress code (sweatpants are *totally* acceptable) isn’t so bad either.
