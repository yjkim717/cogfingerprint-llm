## Remember When The Rock Turned Hollywood on Us?

Man, wrestling nostalgia is hitting *hard* lately. Scrolling through wrestling forums, I keep seeing chatter about OSW retrospectives, and someone dropped a seriously intriguing idea: a deep dive into The Rock’s Hollywood heel run back in 2002-2003. 

Suddenly, I was transported back. I was a teenager, obsessed with *Smackdown*, and The Rock was *the* guy. He was electrifying, the People’s Champion… and then, BAM! He was insulting the entire WWE Universe for chasing Hollywood dreams. 

It felt so… personal. Like he was rejecting *us*, his fans. It was a brilliant, brutal character shift. Seeing him embrace that arrogant, “I’m better than you” persona during that era of *Ruthless Aggression* was genuinely shocking. It wasn’t just about winning matches; it was about making a statement.

Thinking back, it’s fascinating how effectively he used that transition to build anticipation for his movie career. It's a masterclass in blurring the lines between wrestling and reality. Makes you wonder what other eras deserve that kind of in-depth OSW treatment, doesn't it? Anyone else remember being completely blindsided by that heel turn?
