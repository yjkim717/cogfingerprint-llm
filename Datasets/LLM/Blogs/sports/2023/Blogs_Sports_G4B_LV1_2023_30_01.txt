**Is the Jazz Tanking? A Strange Season in the NBA**

Okay, so I’ve been watching the NBA this year, and something’s been bothering me about the Utah Jazz. Their record is…rough. Really rough. It’s led to this weird debate: are they *trying* to lose? The theory is they’re intentionally tanking to secure a higher draft pick. It’s a cynical take, sure, but fascinating to consider. Makes you wonder if winning at all costs isn’t always the answer, especially when it comes to building a long-term team.  It’s a reminder that even in the flashiest leagues, strategy runs deep.
