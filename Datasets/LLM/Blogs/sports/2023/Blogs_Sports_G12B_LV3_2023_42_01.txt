## Remember When Running Was Everything? A College Football Flashback

It’s 2023, and if you’re watching college football, you’re likely seeing a whole lot of passing. Quarterbacks slinging it all over the field, spread formations, and a constant aerial assault. It’s exciting, no doubt, but sometimes I find myself thinking about a different era. 

I was recently reflecting on the 1973 Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns, and it struck me just how drastically the game has changed. Back then, it was all about the wishbone offense and pounding the rock. Forget fancy passing plays; these teams lived and died by their running game. Picture this: relentless drives, powerful fullbacks, and defenses constantly bracing for impact. 

It wasn't about highlight-reel touchdowns every play; it was about wearing down your opponent, inching forward, and controlling the clock. There was a certain grit and physicality to it that feels almost foreign now. 

Thinking about it makes you appreciate the evolution of the sport, but also miss a little bit of that old-school toughness. Do you remember those days, or have you only known the modern, pass-happy game? I'd love to hear your thoughts!
