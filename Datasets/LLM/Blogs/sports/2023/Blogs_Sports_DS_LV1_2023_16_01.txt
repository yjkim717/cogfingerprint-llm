### The Tuesday Scramble: More Than Just Trivia

It’s Tuesday evening, and my phone buzzes with an urgency usually reserved for a breaking news alert or a last-second Hail Mary. But it’s neither. It’s the notification for “Premier Tier Trivia,” and my heart does a little jump. For the uninitiated, this is the weekly college football trivia contest that has become the highlight of my week, a sacred mid-week ritual that has less to do with knowing who won the 1984 Orange Bowl and everything to do with connection.

You see, 2023 has been a year of noise. The realignment carousel spun into overdrive, NIL deals became more discussed than playoff rankings, and the transfer portal never seemed to close. It’s easy to feel like the soul of the sport—the pageantry, the rivalries, the sheer, unscripted joy—is getting lost in the financials. But every Tuesday, that soul is alive and well in our little digital league.

The email hits our inboxes promptly at 7 PM. There’s a mad, silent scramble. The questions range from iconic Heisman moments to obscure mascot origins. But the real thrill? The speed bonus. It’s not enough to just be right; you have to be fast. It’s a ten-minute window of pure, unadulterated focus, a race against the clock and your friends. That little “+5 Speed Bonus” next to your name on the individual standings is a badge of honor, a tiny victory in a week that might otherwise be filled with mundane tasks.

And that’s the magic, isn’t it? For those ten minutes, we’re not scattered across the country, bogged down by meetings or chores. We’re a huddle again, just like we were in our college days, arguing over who the best third-string quarterback of the early 2000s was. The team rankings and individual scores are just the framework; the real win is the string of texts that follow: “How did you know that?!” and “I can’t believe I blanked on that one!”

In a sport that feels like it’s changing by the minute, this Tuesday tradition is a constant. It reminds me that at its core, football fandom is a shared language, a collective memory. And sometimes, all it takes is a little trivia to bring you right back to the heart of it.
