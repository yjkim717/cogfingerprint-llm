The 2023 NBA playoffs - where athleticism meets artistry. I still feel the sting of disappointment from the missed dunk contest. As a lifelong basketball fan, I was expecting something special. Instead, it felt like a lazy encore. Much like Todd in the Shadow's lackluster font choice for his 2023 worst list, the dunk contest was a missed opportunity for flair. Here's to hoping the next season brings more creativity to the court - and the font choices are as bold as the players' moves. The bar is set high for 2024.
