There’s something special about a sold-out rink—the energy in Fargo was electric this year, a true hockey town embracing every moment. Yet, seeing Manchester’s half-empty seats felt like a missed connection, a reminder that passion isn’t universal. It makes me reflect on what builds that magic: community, tradition, a shared heartbeat in the stands. Some places just get it right.
