**The Shot I Still Replay**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single moment can stick with you, years later? For me, it’s a basketball shot from my sophomore year. Down by one, seconds on the clock – a desperation heave from beyond the arc. It bounced once, twice… and fell in. Pure chaos. 

I still replay that shot in my head sometimes, not for the glory, but for the feeling of absolute, unadulterated *belief*. It reminds me that even when things feel impossible, a little faith can go a long way. 2023 feels like a good year to hold onto that feeling.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
