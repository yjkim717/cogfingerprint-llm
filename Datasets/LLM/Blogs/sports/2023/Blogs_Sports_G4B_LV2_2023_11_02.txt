**The Unexpected Joy of Watching Baseball**

Okay, I’ll admit it – I used to roll my eyes at baseball. Too slow, too much standing around. But this summer, something shifted. Watching the Cubs, just *watching*, felt…peaceful. It’s not about the stats or the wins, really. It’s about the shared experience, the way a beautiful afternoon melts away with each pitch. There’s a quiet dignity to it, a reminder to just *be* present.  Turns out, sometimes the simplest things bring the biggest joy. ⚾️ #baseball #summer #reflection
