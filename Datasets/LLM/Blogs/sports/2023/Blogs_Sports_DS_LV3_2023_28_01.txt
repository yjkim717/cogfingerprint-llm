The year was 2023, and my running playlist was my secret weapon. I’d spent months curating the perfect mix on Amazon Music—high-energy tracks to push through the final mile. But lately, my rhythm was broken. Not by fatigue, but by technology. Mid-run, the music would stutter and buffer, shattering my focus. I’d fumble with my Android phone, trying to skip the glitching track, only to find the playlist frozen, unchangeable. It was more than an annoyance; it was a disconnect. That seamless flow between body and beat, the one that makes you feel unstoppable, was gone. I was left with just the sound of my own heavy breathing and the frustration of a rhythm interrupted.
