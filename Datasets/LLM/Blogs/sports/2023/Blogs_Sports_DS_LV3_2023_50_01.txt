There I was, lacing up my running shoes in 2023, ready to hit the pavement with my favorite playlist synced to my Garmin watch. But halfway through my first mile, the music just… stopped. No warning, no heads-up—just silence. My downloaded tunes had expired without any reminder from my device. It was a frustrating lesson in not relying solely on tech. Sometimes, the only rhythm you need is the sound of your own footsteps pushing you forward.
