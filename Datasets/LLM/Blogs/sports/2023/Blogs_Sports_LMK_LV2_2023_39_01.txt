"When My Marathon Moment Turned into a Lesson in Perseverance"

As I stood at the starting line of my first marathon in 2023, I felt a mix of excitement and nerves. But nothing could have prepared me for the unexpected twist that awaited me - a knee injury that forced me to walk the last 5 miles. Frustration and disappointment were my initial reactions, but as I reflected on the experience, I realized that it taught me a valuable lesson in perseverance. Just like in life, when things don't go as planned, we have to adapt and keep moving forward. The support of fellow runners and the kindness of strangers along the route helped me push through the tough moments. Although I didn't cross the finish line with a personal best time, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that I'll carry with me long after the medals fade.
