**Chasing a Different Kind of Edge**

Okay, so I’ve been experimenting with something a little…weird lately. Cold showers. Seriously. I know, it sounds like a terrible idea, right? But I’d been feeling sluggish, like my workouts just weren’t giving me the boost I needed. 

I started with just 30 seconds – a quick shock to the system. Now, I’m pushing it to a minute, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer. My breathing feels deeper, more conscious. I’ve been really focusing on actually *breathing* into my lungs, trying to slow things down. 

And get this – my eyes! I’ve heard about “hunter eyes” – that intense, focused look – and I swear I’ve noticed a slight shift. Maybe it’s the adrenaline, maybe it’s just placebo, but it’s a cool little bonus. 

It’s not about vanity, though. It’s about feeling more connected to my body, more present during my runs. It’s a tiny shift, but I think it’s building a different kind of edge, one that goes beyond just muscle strength.  Anyone else brave enough to try it?
