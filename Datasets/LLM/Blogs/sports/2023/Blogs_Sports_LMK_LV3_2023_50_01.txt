As I pounded the pavement on my latest run, I was jolted back to reality when my Garmin watch cut out - my downloaded music had expired. It was a frustrating moment, lost in the zone without my tunes. A simple reminder before the expiration date would have saved the day. As runners, we rely on our tech to enhance our experience. Let's hope Garmin takes note - a timely reminder would make all the difference for music lovers like me, keeping us in our groove and on track.
