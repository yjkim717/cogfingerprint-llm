**Are You Really Pushing Yourself?**

Remember that feeling after a workout – that satisfying ache, the sense that you *almost* went harder? I’ve been wrestling with this lately, especially as I’ve gotten more serious about my training. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking “okay, that was good,” and then settling for lighter weights next time.

But a recent study really got me thinking: it seems a lot of us are underestimating what we’re truly capable of. This meta-analysis highlighted that we often choose weights that are simply too light, essentially starving our muscles of the challenge they need to grow stronger and build real hypertrophy. 

It’s a humbling realization! It’s not about ego; it’s about consistent, targeted progress.  Maybe it’s time to step up, embrace the burn, and truly test the limits of what we’re building. What are your thoughts?
