Remember that pickup basketball game last summer? I was feeling unstoppable, sinking threes like it was nothing. Then they split up the teams, putting me with all the newcomers against a squad of seasoned regulars. My rhythm vanished. I went from MVP to barely touching the ball. It felt like the game itself was punishing me for playing well. That's the competitive Crucible in a nutshell right nowâ€”your hard-earned skills just get you matched into a frustrating uphill battle where your favorite moves suddenly don't work anymore.
