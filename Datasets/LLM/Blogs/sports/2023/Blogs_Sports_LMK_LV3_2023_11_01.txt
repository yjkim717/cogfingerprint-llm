As I dove into my latest Football Manager game in 2023, I found myself pondering the intricacies of transfer fees and future finances. Managing a team isn't just about signing top talent, but also about balancing the books. I wished for a feature to track net future transfer fees, making it easier to anticipate incoming and outgoing payments. This got me thinking - isn't that what makes or breaks a team in the game, and in real life? Effective game management is all about making smart financial decisions that secure a bright future.
