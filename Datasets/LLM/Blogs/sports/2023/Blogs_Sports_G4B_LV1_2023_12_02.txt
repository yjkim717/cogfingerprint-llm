**Decoding the Bonvoy Brilliant Bonus: A Newbie’s Dilemma**

So, I’ve been diving into the world of Marriott Bonvoy, and let’s be honest, it’s a bit of a rabbit hole! I recently joined as a member and, like many new travelers, I’m trying to wrap my head around the points system. I encountered a common question – a new member is puzzling over their initial points earnings after their first hotel stay with a Bonvoy Brilliant card. 

It really highlights how complex points calculations can be. Are you factoring in elite status? Are bonus points being applied correctly?  The online calculator felt a little overwhelming. It’s a fantastic reminder that even with loyalty programs, detailed understanding is key to maximizing your rewards.  I’m planning to spend some time really dissecting the Bonvoy Brilliant benefits and rules before my next trip – anyone else feel this way?

**The Rain Delay That Changed Everything**

It was a grey, drizzly afternoon in 2023, and I was at the local baseball stadium with my dad. The game was tight, a real nail-biter. Then, *boom* – a torrential downpour. A lengthy rain delay stretched on for over two hours.  Most fans were grumpy, scrolling through their phones. But my dad? He pulled out a deck of cards. 

We played a surprisingly intense game of poker, the sound of rain drumming on the roof providing the soundtrack.  It wasn't about winning or losing; it was just about being *together*, finding a little joy in a frustrating situation. That rain delay, and that impromptu game, stuck with me. It reminded me that sometimes, the best moments in life aren’t the planned ones – they’re the unexpected detours.
