**The Box Out Blues (and a Little Mental Shift)**

Okay, real talk: this season in the local men’s league has been… humbling. I’m facing some seriously tough competition – guys who are quicker and just a little bit stronger than me. I’ve been getting hammered in the post, missing easy rebounds, and honestly, feeling pretty frustrated. 

For a while, I was just trying to muscle my way through, which, predictably, wasn’t working. My coach suggested focusing on *post position* – getting a better angle, using my feet. It’s about being smarter, not just bigger.  

More importantly, he talked about *mentality*.  It’s easy to get down when you’re losing battles, but dwelling on it just makes it harder to adjust. I’m working on staying present, focusing on each *box out* and *entry pass* opportunity. Small improvements, right?  It’s a process.
