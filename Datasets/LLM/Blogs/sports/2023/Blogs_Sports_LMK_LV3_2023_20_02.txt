As I scrolled through ToddintheShadow's 2023 worst list, I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment - not about the teams that made the cut, but the font. With blockbuster events like the Eras Tour and releases like Barbie and Oppenheimer dominating the headlines, I expected a more creative approach. A simple font change would've elevated the list, much like a game-changing play can shift the momentum in sports. Maybe 2024 will be the year ToddintheShadow steps up its formatting game?
