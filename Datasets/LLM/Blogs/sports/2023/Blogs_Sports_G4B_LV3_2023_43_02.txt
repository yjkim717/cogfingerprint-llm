Input: A player seeking advice on building a strong control deck, specifically referencing Priest archetypes from the past.
Output: There’s something deeply satisfying about a well-executed control strategy in any game, really. I was revisiting some old Hearthstone Priest decks last week – those patient, methodical builds – and it reminded me of my college basketball team. We’d often just grind out wins, weathering the storm, waiting for the perfect opening. It’s a humbling, but rewarding, way to play.
