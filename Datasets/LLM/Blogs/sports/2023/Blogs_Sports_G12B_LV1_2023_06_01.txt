>## Did Anyone See That Cavs Exit Coming?

Okay, seriously. Who predicted the Knicks would sweep the Cavaliers in the playoffs? Not me, that's for sure. I was genuinely excited about Cleveland’s roster this year – Donovan Mitchell alongside Darius Garland, Jarrett Allen anchoring the defense… on paper, it looked like a serious contender. 

But something just wasn't clicking. The offense felt stagnant, and Mitchell, despite flashes of brilliance, never quite seemed to find his rhythm. The Knicks, on the other hand, brought relentless energy and a surprisingly disciplined game plan. 

It’s a tough pill to swallow for Cavs fans. It really makes you question whether individual talent alone can guarantee playoff success. Team chemistry, coaching adjustments, and just plain old grit sometimes matter more. This series was a brutal reminder of that, and a fascinating early exit to unpack as we head into the offseason. What do you guys think went wrong?
