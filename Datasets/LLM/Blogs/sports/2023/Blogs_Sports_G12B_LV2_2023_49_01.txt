## The Unexpected Pivot: Like a Late-Game Substitution

It's funny how life mirrors sports sometimes, isn’t it? I was *so* set on running a half-marathon this fall. Training was going well, the playlist was perfect… then a knee tweak sidelined me. Disappointment, obviously. But it forced a pivot. Now I’m rediscovering the joy of recreational cycling – something I hadn't touched in years. 

It’s a reminder that even with the best-laid plans, sometimes you need to adjust your strategy. Just like a coach making a late-game substitution to shift the momentum. This year has felt like that for so many of us, hasn't it? Embracing the unexpected, finding the win in a different play.
