There I was, laced up and ready to hit the pavement in 2023, my Garmin watch strapped on. But as I started my run, silence. My pre-downloaded playlist had expired without a single warning over Wi-Fi. No beat to push me, just the sound of my own labored breathing. It was a stark reminder that in our tech-reliant world, sometimes the most honest run is the one powered solely by your own rhythm and resolve. A frustrating, but strangely freeing, lesson.
