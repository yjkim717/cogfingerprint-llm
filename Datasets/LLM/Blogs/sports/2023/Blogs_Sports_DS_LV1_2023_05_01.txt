Looking ahead to the 2024 season from our 2023 vantage point, I can't help but feel the West is a true championship gauntlet. It’s not just about young talent anymore. You’ve got these battle-tested teams with older stars who’ve been there, who own rings and know what a finals run demands. Beating them isn't just a game; it's a grueling test of will. The eventual champ will have truly earned it, having survived a war of attrition against the league’s most experienced giants.
