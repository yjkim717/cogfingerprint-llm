The parallels between the cannabis industry and professional sports are striking. Just as Cresco Labs is taking a stand against unpaid bills from Massachusetts dispensaries, athletes and teams are fighting for fair compensation and contracts. In 2023, the push for transparency and accountability is evident across industries. As we watch Cresco Labs sue Terps – Attleboro and Terps – Wellfleet over $88,662, we're reminded that, whether on the court or in the cannabis market, fair play and financial integrity are essential for success.
