## The Unexpected Comfort of a Familiar Cheer

It's funny, isn't it? How certain things just feel like home. I’m planning a trip up to Redwood National Park this fall – towering trees, misty mornings… bliss! But I realized I was obsessing over finding Rainier beer in Eureka and Arcata. Sounds silly, I know. It’s just… that specific, slightly-sweet taste reminds me of watching Mariners games with my dad. A little piece of nostalgia amidst the grandeur of the redwoods. Maybe it’s not about the beer itself, but the memories it carries.
