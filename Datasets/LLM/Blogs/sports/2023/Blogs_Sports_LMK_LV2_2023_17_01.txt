As I stepped onto the court in 2023, I couldn't help but think of my Elden Ring warrior build - the strategy, the stats, the thrill of progression. Similarly, in basketball, every player's stats tell a story. I reflect on my own journey, from a novice to a team player, and how understanding my strengths and weaknesses helped me grow. Just like in RPGs, embracing our vulnerabilities is key to improvement. By acknowledging and working on our weaknesses, we can unlock our true potential and become a valuable asset to our team.
