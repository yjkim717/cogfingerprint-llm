### The Blueberry Conundrum: A Cautionary Tale

I almost lost my beloved blueberry bushes to a classic case of misdiagnosis. Last season, their leaves turned a worrying shade of purple, a clear sign of distress. I jumped to the conclusion that our soil was too alkaline and launched a full-scale assault with soil acidifiers. It was a gardener's blunder.

This spring, the bushes were silent. A few brittle, purple-tinged stems stood where lush foliage should have been. Desperate, I had the soil tested. The result was a gut punch: the problem wasn't the soil's pH; it was a severe ammonium deficiency. Blueberries are unique; they thrive on ammonium-nitrogen, not the nitrates most plants prefer. My well-intentioned acidifying treatment did nothing to address the actual hunger of the plants.

The purple leaves were a cry for a specific nutrient, not a blanket condemnation of the soil's character. I’m now carefully amending the soil with an ammonium-based fertilizer, praying the root systems are still viable enough to push out new growth. It’s a humbling lesson in looking beyond the most obvious symptom to find the true root of the problem.

And here is a reflective blog post about sports for 2023.

### The Unlikely MVP of 2023

It wasn't the final buzzer-beater or the championship win that defined my 2023 sports year. It was a Tuesday night in November, watching my ten-year-old nephew’s basketball team get soundly beaten by 20 points.

With a minute left on the clock, his team inbounding the ball under their own basket, I saw it. Instead of launching a hopeless three-pointer, my nephew passed the ball to the one kid on the team who hadn’t scored all season. He set a perfect screen, and the boy took an awkward, off-balance shot that somehow swished through the net.

The bench erupted. The losing team celebrated that single basket like they’d won the title. In that moment, I remembered what sports are really about. In a year of record-breaking contracts and blockbuster trades, the most powerful play I saw was a simple act of selflessness. It wasn't about winning; it was about making sure everyone felt the joy of the game. That’s a victory that doesn’t show up on a stat sheet, but it’s the one that lasts.
