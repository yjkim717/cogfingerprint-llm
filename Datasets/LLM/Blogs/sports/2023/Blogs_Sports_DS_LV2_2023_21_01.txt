### The Weight of a Number Before a Single Snap

So, the preseason poll is out. Georgia, Michigan, Ohio State. The usual suspects, right? Seeing those names at the top, neatly ranked before a single player has broken a sweat in a game that counts, always gives me a strange feeling. It’s a mix of excitement and a heavy dose of skepticism.

I remember being a kid, my own team’s ranking feeling like an unbreakable prophecy. A number two by your name in August? You were destined for glory. It was written in stone. Now, with a few more seasons under my belt, I see it for what it is: the world’s most educated guess. It’s a projection based on last year’s heartbreak, returning talent, and potential. But potential is a fragile thing.

That #1 next to Georgia is a crown of thorns as much as it is a laurel. Every team they play will have "UPSET THE TOP DOGS" circled on their calendar. For Michigan and Ohio State, it’s just the latest chapter in a rivalry that needs no extra fuel, yet here we are, pouring it on anyway.

These polls set a narrative, but the beautiful, chaotic game of college football has a way of shredding scripts. An underdog’s stunning upset, a star quarterback’s untimely injury—the entire landscape can shift in one Saturday. So, while I’ll glance at these rankings and feel that familiar buzz, I know the real story starts when the cleats hit the grass. The poll gives us order, but the season… the season gives us the unforgettable chaos we truly live for.
