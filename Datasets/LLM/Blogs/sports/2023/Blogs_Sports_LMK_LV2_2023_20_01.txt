"As I watched the latest Jelles Marble Runs wave event unfold, a thought struck me - why don't they display the total scores after each run? It seems like a simple addition to the scoreboard that could heighten the excitement. In 2023, with the competition format more thrilling than ever, this tweak could take the event thread to the next level. I'd love to see the total runs tally displayed alongside the individual run scores. It would add an extra layer of suspense to the competition. Maybe it's time for a scoring format refresh?"
