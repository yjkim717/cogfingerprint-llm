## The Unexpected Beauty of a Mid-Run Snap

It's funny, isn't it, how a sport so focused on pushing limits can also be captured in such fleeting, beautiful moments? I was scrolling through Reddit the other day – a rabbit hole as usual – and stumbled upon a thread encouraging runners to share their photos. It got me thinking about the pictures I *don't* take, the ones I miss while battling a hill or chasing a personal best.

This year, I've been trying to be more present, to actually *see* the world around me while running. And sometimes, that means pausing, even for a second, to appreciate the golden light filtering through the trees on my usual route, or the determined faces of fellow runners pushing through their own challenges. 

Maybe I'll even join that photo challenge next Friday. It's a good reminder that the journey itself, and the little moments within it, are worth documenting, even if it's just a quick snap on your phone.
