It’s 2023, and I’ve spent more hours than I’d care to admit hunched over my laptop, deep in a Football Manager 22 save. My latest obsession? The "Clauses" tab. I’m meticulously planning future seasons, but my notepad is a mess of scribbled numbers—pending transfer fees, looming salary commitments. I dream of a feature that just does the math for me, calculating the net future cost automatically. It’s funny, isn’t it? How a game can make you feel like a real sporting director, lost in the beautiful, frustrating details of building a team. It’s not just a game; it’s a parallel life.
