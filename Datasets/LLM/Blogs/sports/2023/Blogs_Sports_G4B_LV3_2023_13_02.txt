**The Unpredictable Curveball – And Why It Drives Us Crazy**

You know that feeling when you’ve meticulously planned a whole game, built your strategy, and then… BAM! – someone throws a curveball you absolutely didn’t see coming? It’s frustrating, right? That’s exactly how I’ve been feeling lately watching Marvel Snap. 

I’ve noticed a real struggle against those discard decks – they just seem to relentlessly strip away everything I’ve worked for, only for my big hitters to pop back up. It's like they’re designed to *destroy* my carefully constructed deck. 

It got me thinking about sports, specifically tennis. You can analyze every serve, every return, but a sudden change in wind, a clever shot, or just a really good day for your opponent can completely derail your game plan. 

I’d love to see a card design that addresses this – maybe a ‘Layla Miller’ type character who can proactively disrupt discard strategies, or even a tweaked Ghost Rider with a more devastating ‘destroy’ effect.  It’s that unpredictability, that constant need to adapt, that’s what makes the game so captivating, and so infuriating!
