## Missed Opportunity on the Field (and in the Rankings?)

Okay, so Todd’s latest sports rankings came out, and while I appreciate the effort, I couldn’t help but think… what if? It felt like a missed opportunity! With *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* dominating the cultural conversation all year, wouldn’t it have been *amazing* if he’d used the *Oppenheimer* font for his "worst" picks and the *Barbie* font for the best? Just imagine the impact! It would have been a fun, memorable nod to 2023’s biggest movies. Alas, we’ll have to settle for the standard typeface.
