**The Unexpected Turn in the Game**

You know how sometimes you’re pouring your heart out on the field, completely focused on the next play, and then… everything changes? That’s exactly how my recent hockey tournament felt. We were battling for a championship, and the taxiing to the rink felt like an eternity. Then, the chaotic scramble at baggage claim – lost gloves, misplaced helmets – it was pure frustration. 

But then, a surprise $200 gift card from the league! It was a small thing, really, but it reminded me that even in the midst of a tough game, unexpected good things can happen. It’s a good reminder to appreciate the journey, not just the victory.
