**The Power of Community: How a College Football Fanbase Came Together for a Greater Cause**

As the holiday season approaches, many of us are filled with a sense of joy, giving, and community. For fans of college football, this time of year is not just about bowl games and championship matchups, but also about the spirit of camaraderie that defines the sport.
