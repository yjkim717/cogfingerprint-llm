As I sat in the stadium in 2023, watching the Yankees take on their rivals, I realized I'd been on a streak of attending consecutive games by my favorite teams. Just like a film buff might follow a director's works, I'd been tracking the performances of my beloved baseball teams. The thrill of live sports is unmatched - the energy of the crowd, the crack of the bat. I'm now on a mission to watch every MLB team play at least once this season. The excitement is building, and I'm hooked!
