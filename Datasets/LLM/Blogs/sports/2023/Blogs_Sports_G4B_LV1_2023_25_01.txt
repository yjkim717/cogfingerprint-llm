**The Left-Handed Quest**

Seriously, finding left-handed golf clubs feels like searching for a unicorn! I’ve been digging around online, mainly through some seriously helpful internet dealers, trying to track down a decent set. Living near Montreal, Canada, it’s surprisingly tricky. I’m hoping to connect with a local lefty club – someone who understands the specific needs of a southpaw.  HDCP ratings are a constant consideration, too! Wish me luck!
