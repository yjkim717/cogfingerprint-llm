There’s something about a race photo that captures more than just a moment—it holds the story of that long run, the ache in your legs, the rhythm of your breath. Last Friday, scrolling through our community’s Photo Friday shares, I saw snapshots of familiar routes and finish-line grins. Each image felt like a shared memory, a quiet nod to the miles we’ve logged. In 2023, it’s these small connections that remind me why I run: not just for the race, but for the stories we carry with us.
