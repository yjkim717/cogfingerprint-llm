As I watched the tennis tournament in 2023, I couldn't help but think of my own struggles to nurture a mango tree. Just like a temperamental tropical plant, a talented athlete can wither under the wrong conditions. I realized that, just as etsy sellers must carefully tend to their plants, athletes need the right environment to flourish. Perhaps, the key to success lies not just in the individual, but in the harmony between the individual and their surroundings.
