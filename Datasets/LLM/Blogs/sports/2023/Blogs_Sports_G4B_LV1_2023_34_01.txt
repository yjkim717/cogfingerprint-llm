**The Ghosts of Ratings Past**

It’s weird how much we still fixate on those college football ratings, isn’t it? As 2023 winds down, I’ve been digging back through old data – specifically, those tiered rankings: 75+, 90+, 95+, and the holy grail, 99+.  It’s easy to get lost in the numbers, to think a 95-rated team *automatically* deserves a national championship shot. 

But honestly, looking back, it feels a bit… sterile.  You see teams that dominated a single season – like Georgia in ‘21 – soar to the top, and then fade a bit in the next.  Those ratings capture a snapshot in time, not a true reflection of sustained excellence.  

Maybe it’s just me, but I'm starting to value the grit, the underdog stories, and the unexpected victories *more* than any arbitrary number. What do you think?
