## The Long Game and Football Manager's Missing Piece

I've sunk *way* too many hours into Football Manager this year, as usual. There’s something endlessly fascinating about building a club, scouting talent, and trying to outwit the transfer market. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with a persistent frustration. It's easy to see the immediate cost of a player – the upfront fee – but planning for the *future* feels clunky.

Wouldn't it be incredible to have a clear overview, like the salary commitment screen, but for future transfer fees? Seeing those buyback clauses and potential profit margins laid out upfront would seriously elevate the strategic depth. It's a small thing, maybe, but it would make long-term planning feel a whole lot more…real. Here's hoping SI Games hears the call!
