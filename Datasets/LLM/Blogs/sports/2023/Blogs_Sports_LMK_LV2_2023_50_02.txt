As I laced up my running shoes in 2023, I couldn't help but think about my trusty smartwatch. I've been pushing it hard, tracking every step, GPS route, and streamed playlist. But when it dipped below 20% on the sixth day, I felt a pang of disappointment. Wasn't it supposed to last longer? My moderate usage shouldn't be draining the battery so fast. Guess I still have a thing or two to learn about my smartwatch's limits.
