## Did Anyone Else See That Cavs Exit Coming?

Okay, I'm still processing it. The Cleveland Cavaliers' early exit from the 2023 NBA Playoffs against the New York Knicks felt…deflating. Honestly, I was genuinely surprised. We had Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley anchoring the defense, and a roster that, on paper, looked poised for a deep run. 

Seeing them fall so quickly got me thinking. Is it chemistry? Strategy? Sometimes, talent just isn't enough, right? It's a tough reminder that the NBA is brutal, and playoff basketball is a different beast entirely. Here's hoping the Cavs can regroup and learn from this experience – I'm still a believer! What are your thoughts on their performance?
