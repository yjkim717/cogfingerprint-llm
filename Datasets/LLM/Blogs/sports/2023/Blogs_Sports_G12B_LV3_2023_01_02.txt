## That Feeling When You *Almost* Missed It…

Anyone else ever feel like victory slips through your fingers? I was replaying *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order* the other day – still obsessed, honestly – and got caught up in a tough boss fight. I was so focused on winning, I almost missed the shimmering XP beam! It's a silly parallel, but it reminded me of those close games where you're laser-focused on the win, and forget to appreciate the journey. 2023 and still learning that lesson!
