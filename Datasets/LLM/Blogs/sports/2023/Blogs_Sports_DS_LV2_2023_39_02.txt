The final buzzer echoed through the empty arena last night. After 20 years, my weekly pickup game is over—the old community center is closing. It wasn’t about winning; it was the ritual. The same jokes, the same groans after a missed shot. In 2023, real connection feels scarce. Lacing up those sneakers was my anchor. I’m not just losing a game; I’m losing the locker room talk that kept me grounded.
