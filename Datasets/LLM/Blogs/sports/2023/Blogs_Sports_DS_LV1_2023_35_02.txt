The first time I saw a race photo of myself from last winter’s 10K, I almost didn’t recognize the runner. It wasn't just the pained expression or the frosty beard; it was the sheer grit captured in that single frame.

That photo now lives in our online running group’s “Photo Friday” album, a digital scrapbook of our collective journey. We share everything: the serene, snow-dusted routes at dawn, the triumphant (and sometimes hilarious) finish line faces, and the quiet, solitary miles. In 2023, where so much of life feels curated, this space is beautifully raw. It’s not about perfect form or fast times; it’s a testament to simply showing up. Every shared image is a quiet nod of understanding, a reminder that we’re all out there, braving the elements together. It’s the encouragement I didn’t know I needed, one photo at a time.
