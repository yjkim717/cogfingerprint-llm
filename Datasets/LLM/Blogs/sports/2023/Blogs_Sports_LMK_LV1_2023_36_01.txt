"The Self-Infatuated 'Slam Dunk' of NBA Marketing?"

As a huge NBA fan, I've been following the marketing buzz around the latest season, and one thing caught my attention - the over-the-top self-promotion by some teams. Take, for instance, the "We're the Best Team Ever" campaign by a certain top contender. While it's meant to be confidence-booster, it comes across as self-infatuated and may actually be turning off potential fans. I mean, who doesn't love a good underdog story, right? The relentless self-praise feels like a slap in the face to the very fans they're trying to woo. It's like they're saying, "We're great, and you're not, so just acknowledge our greatness." I'm worried that this approach might backfire, much like the box office concerns surrounding "The Marvels" movie. A more humble, relatable approach might just be the slam dunk these teams need to win over the hearts (and tickets) of fans.
