That final buzzer in 2023 hit differently. After years of chasing stats, I finally understood it wasn't about the scoreboard. It was about the shared groans after a missed shot, the silent high-fives, the pure, unscripted joy of the game. All those drills just taught me how to be present. Funny how you spend your life training to win, only to discover the real victory was in simply playing.
