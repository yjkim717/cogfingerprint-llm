It’s 2023, and I’m still thinking about Andrew Luck. Remember when he retired so young? Looking back at those top-three QB draft picks, it’s striking how many pass attempts he racked up so quickly. It makes you wonder about the weight we put on these young players' shoulders from day one. The draft is just the beginning; the real story is written in those relentless seasons, one throw at a time. Some shoulders are just built to carry more.
