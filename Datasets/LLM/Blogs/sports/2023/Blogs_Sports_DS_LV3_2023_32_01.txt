There’s something special about hearing directly from the people who live and breathe college football. I was just listening to Phil Steele on a recent podcast, and his passion for the game is downright infectious. He broke down his 2023 preview with such detail, it felt like getting an insider’s key to the season. And the best part? He offered a discount for listeners. It’s these personal touches that remind me why I love this sport—it’s a community, not just a competition.
