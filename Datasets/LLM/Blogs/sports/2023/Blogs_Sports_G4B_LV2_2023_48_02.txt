**The Ghost of a Combo**

There’s something frustrating about chasing a perfect move, right? I’ve been wrestling with a particular combo in *Mortal Kombat* lately – with Ashra. It *used* to pop off flawlessly, but now it’s just… gone.  I keep thinking maybe it’s a subtle nerf, a little tweak that threw everything off. It’s a weird feeling, like losing a familiar friend.

Would you like me to tweak this or create a different version?
