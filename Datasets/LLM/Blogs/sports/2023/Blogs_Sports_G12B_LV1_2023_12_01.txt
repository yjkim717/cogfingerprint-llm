## The Dynasty Beckons (and I Might Be Stepping Aside)

It's late October 2023, and the fantasy football season is hitting its stride. But I've been thinking about something bigger – dynasty leagues. Specifically, the 12-team keeper league I’ve been running. It’s a commitment, you know? Building a team across years, chasing long-term success. I'm considering passing the reins. If you crave that deep strategy, 4 keepers, and a competitive H2H battle, hit me up! ($25 buy-in to keep the league thriving.)
