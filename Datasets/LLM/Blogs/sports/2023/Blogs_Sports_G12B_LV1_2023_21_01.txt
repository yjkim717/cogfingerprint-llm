## The Weight of Expectations: Preseason Polls and the Georgia Bulldogs

It’s August, which means one thing in my world: the slow, delicious burn of college football anticipation. The humidity is thick, the smell of freshly cut grass is everywhere, and I’m already obsessively refreshing my favorite college football subreddit, /r/CFB. This year, the talk of the town (and the online forums) is the preseason polls, and, predictably, the Georgia Bulldogs are sitting pretty at number one.

Honestly, it’s almost… unsettling.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a proud Georgia fan. We earned that championship last year. Stetson Bennett proved the doubters wrong, the defense was a brick wall, and the whole team just *clicked*. But seeing Georgia consistently ranked as the undisputed top dog before a single snap has been fired feels different. There's a pressure that comes with that kind of expectation, a weight that can crush even the most talented teams.

I remember a few years back, when Alabama was seemingly invincible. Year after year, they'd stroll into the season as the clear favorite, and while they often delivered, there were those moments – those heartbreaking losses – that served as a stark reminder that preseason hype doesn’t guarantee anything. 

Michigan and Ohio State are breathing down Georgia’s neck in the r/CFB poll, and rightfully so. Both programs have rebuilt and are hungry for a shot to knock off the reigning champs.  The Wolverines, particularly, seem poised for another serious run. And you know Ohio State – they’ll be coming for blood.

What worries me isn't the competition itself. It's the internal pressure that this number one ranking can create. Can Georgia handle the expectation of maintaining that dominance? Can they avoid complacency?  Will they still have that same ferocious hunger when everyone expects them to win?

I guess we’ll find out. This season promises to be a wild ride.  The preseason polls are fun to debate, a snapshot of where we are right now. But ultimately, it’s the games that matter. It's the grit, the resilience, and the heart that will determine who truly reigns supreme. And I, for one, am ready for the chaos to begin.
