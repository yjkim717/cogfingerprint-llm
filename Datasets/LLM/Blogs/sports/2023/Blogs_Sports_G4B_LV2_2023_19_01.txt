**The Weight of What Could Be**

Remember those early days of lifting? I do. I’d be meticulously tracking every rep, feeling ridiculously pleased with myself when I managed a slightly heavier weight than last week. But lately, something’s been nagging at me – a feeling that I might be holding myself back.

I recently read a fascinating meta-analysis that basically said a *lot* of us are under-challenging ourselves in the gym. We're often scared to go heavy, sticking with weights that feel “manageable,” and missing out on serious muscle growth potential. It’s a sobering thought! 

It made me realize that sometimes, pushing past that initial discomfort – that feeling of "1RM" – is where the real progress happens. It’s not just about lifting more; it’s about unlocking what your body is truly capable of.  What’s your biggest weight-related challenge right now?
