## The Strange Comfort of Home (and the Atlantic's Oddity)

Something about the 2023 NBA season really stuck with me. Beyond the star power and playoff races, it was the division records that kept looping in my head. It’s fascinating how drastically a team's performance can shift between their home court and the road. Looking at the numbers, the dominance of home-court advantage was undeniable – most teams absolutely thrived in front of their fans.

But then there was the Atlantic Division. Amidst a sea of impressive home winning percentages, they were the oddballs. One team, I can't recall which, managed to actually *win* more games away than at home! It felt like a glitch in the matrix, a reminder that even the most established patterns can be disrupted. It made me wonder about the psychology of it all – what pushes a team to perform better when they’re the underdogs on someone else’s turf? Maybe that’s a story for another time.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
