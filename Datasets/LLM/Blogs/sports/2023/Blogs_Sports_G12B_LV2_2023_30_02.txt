## Something's Shifting: Thinking About Home Court Advantage in 2023

Anyone else find themselves glued to NBA division records this year? I've been diving into the 2023 stats, and it’s fascinating! We always talk about home-court advantage, right? The roar of the crowd, the familiarity… But looking at the numbers, especially the Atlantic Division’s surprisingly strong away record, makes you wonder. 

Is the impact of home court changing? Are teams just better at adapting, traveling smarter? Maybe it's a sign of the league evolving. It’s not about dismissing the energy of a packed arena, but acknowledging that maybe, just maybe, the gap is closing. It’s got me thinking about what truly gives a team an edge these days. What do you think?
