The final buzzer echoed, and I just stood there, sweat dripping, heart full. After a year sidelined by injury, I wasn’t sure I’d ever feel this again—that pure, unscripted joy of playing. It wasn’t about the score; it was about the comeback, the grit, the simple act of moving freely. In 2023, we’re so focused on metrics and wins, but tonight reminded me that the real victory is just being back in the game, wholly and gratefully.
