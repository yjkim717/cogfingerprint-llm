As I watched the latest NBA playoffs in 2023, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between a bent laptop screen and an athlete's injury. Just like my Acer Helios 300's slightly warped display, a minor tweak can snowball into a major issue. The same goes for athletes - a small strain can sideline them for the season. It got me thinking, how can we prevent these mishaps and keep our tech and our bodies in top shape?
