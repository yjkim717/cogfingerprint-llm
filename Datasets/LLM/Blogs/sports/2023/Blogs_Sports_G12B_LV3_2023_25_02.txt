## The Unexpected Lesson from My Little League Loss

Okay, so I’m not exactly known for my athletic prowess. This year, I finally caved and signed my son up for Little League. I envisioned sunny afternoons, cheering crowds, and maybe, just maybe, a few triumphant wins. We lost. A lot. And honestly? It stung. More than it should have.

But watching him, seeing the genuine effort and the way he bounced back after each strikeout, taught me something valuable. It wasn’t about the score; it was about the grit, the teamwork, and the simple joy of showing up. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most important victories aren’t the ones you see on the scoreboard, but the lessons learned along the way. And that, I realized, is a win in itself. 2023 has been full of unexpected lessons, hasn't it?
