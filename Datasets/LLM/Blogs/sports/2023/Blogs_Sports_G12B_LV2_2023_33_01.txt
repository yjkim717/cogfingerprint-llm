## The End of an Era (For Now?)

Remember that feeling of invincibility the Pac-12 had going? Seriously, watching them roll through the early part of the season, racking up win after win, felt… special. It was a nice change of pace in the often-predictable world of college football. That 19-game winning streak was a thing of beauty.

Then, *snap*. It ended. 

It's a reminder, isn't it, that even the best streaks come to an end? It stings a little, sure, but it also just feels… real. Sports are about the ups and downs, the unexpected twists.  The Pac-12 isn't out of it, not by a long shot, but that little bit of magic is gone. And honestly, that's okay. It just means the rest of the season will be even more interesting.



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
