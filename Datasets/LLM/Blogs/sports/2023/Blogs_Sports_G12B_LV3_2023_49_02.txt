## Remember When The Rock Turned… Bad? A WWE Retrospective

It’s wild to think back to 2002-2003, isn't it? We’re so used to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson being the ultimate babyface, the electrifying hero. But there was a period where he embraced the villain role – and it was fascinating, even if a little uneven.

Looking back, it’s a really interesting story arc. WWE was in a transitional space, and The Rock's Hollywood heel run was both brilliant and occasionally… well, a bit clunky. The moments where he truly leaned into the arrogance and charisma were *gold*, but some of the storylines felt rushed. 

It reminds me that even the most iconic figures have phases that aren't perfect. It’s a testament to The Rock's ability that he could pull off both roles so convincingly! Anyone else remember those Attitude Era clashes?
