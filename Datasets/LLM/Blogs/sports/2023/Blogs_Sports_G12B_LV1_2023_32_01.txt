## The Annual Steele Dive & Why I Still Love College Football Predictions

Every August, there's a familiar buzz in the air. It's not just the humidity, it’s the return of college football season, and with it, the annual ritual of pouring over predictions. I've been doing it for decades, and I still find it utterly captivating, even knowing full well how often I'll be proven wrong.

This year, I dove headfirst into Phil Steele’s preview – a tradition for me. I recently listened to a great interview with him on the /r/CFB Talk series, and it really reminded me why I enjoy these deep dives. Steele’s dedication to the data is impressive, and hearing him break down teams and coaching changes with Shane Beamer’s South Carolina program specifically was fascinating.

It's more than just picking winners, though. It’s about the hope, the storylines, and the sheer excitement of a new season. Even if my bracket is a disaster by November, the journey is always worth it. Anyone else feeling that same anticipation?
