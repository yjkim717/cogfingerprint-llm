"When My Marathon Plans Were Grounded: A Lesson in Flexibility"

As I sat at the gate, watching my flight to the Boston Marathon get delayed, I couldn't help but feel frustrated. The lengthy baggage claim upon arrival only added to my stress. But, as I reflected on the experience, I realized that sometimes life's unexpected twists can lead to pleasant surprises. Alaska Airlines' customer service team surprised me with a $300 credit, turning a potentially disastrous travel experience into a positive one. It got me thinking - just like in sports, flexibility is key. Whether it's adjusting to a new training route or coping with a delayed flight, being adaptable can make all the difference. As I finally took to the starting line in 2023, I carried this lesson with me, learning to roll with the punches and appreciate the unexpected moments that make life's journey more interesting.
