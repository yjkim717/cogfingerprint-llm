## Beyond the Gridiron: When College Football Fans Show What Really Matters

The air smells like pine needles and woodsmoke. Christmas music is subtly playing in the background, even though Thanksgiving hasn’t quite passed yet. It's that time of year, isn't it? A time for family, for reflection, for… well, for obsessing over bowl projections and lamenting your team's near-misses.  And, let's be honest, for a *lot* of college football.

2023 has been a wild ride in the world of CFB. We’ve seen Cinderella stories blossom, juggernauts stumble, and the ever-shifting landscape of conference realignment leave many of us feeling a little dizzy.  We've debated NIL deals, transfer portals, and whether or not a certain coach's sideline antics were *really* that bad. We've poured our hearts and souls (and maybe a few too many hours) into following our teams.

But amidst all that passion, all that competition, and all that debate, something truly special happened this year – something that reminded me, and I hope reminded many of you, that college football is about so much more than wins and losses.

It’s about community.

Specifically, I’m talking about the incredible outpouring of generosity from the /r/CFB community. For those unfamiliar, /r/CFB is a massive subreddit – a corner of the internet where hundreds of thousands of college football fans gather to discuss, debate, and generally celebrate (or commiserate) the sport we all love. It's a place where rivalries run deep, but respect – most of the time – prevails.

This year, the /r/CFB community pulled together for their annual holiday drive, raising over $11,000. And where did that money go? Not towards upgrades to stadiums, not towards recruiting budgets, but directly to Toys For Tots and children's hospitals.  It was an effort organized by OurCFB, a fantastic non-profit that focuses on leveraging the passion of the college football community for good.

Now, $11,000 might not seem like a monumental sum in the grand scheme of things. But let me tell you, the *impact* of that money is enormous. Think about the faces of the kids who will receive a new toy this Christmas, thanks to the generosity of strangers who share a love for a game. Think about the children in hospitals, battling illnesses, who will experience a little bit of joy and distraction because of this collective effort.

It hit me pretty hard, actually, when I first saw the announcement. I’ve been part of the /r/CFB community for years. I’ve engaged in countless heated debates about quarterback rankings, offensive line play, and the merits of
