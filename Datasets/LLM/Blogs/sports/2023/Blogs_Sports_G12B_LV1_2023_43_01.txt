>## The Unexpected Joy of Watching My Team Lose

Okay, I know it sounds weird, but something shifted for me this season watching the Falcons. For years, I’ve been a die-hard, win-or-lose fan, but this year, with a clearly rebuilding team, I’ve found a different kind of enjoyment. It's less about the scoreboard and more about appreciating the grind, the young players learning, the small victories amidst the losses. 

Seeing them battle, even when the odds are stacked against them, is surprisingly inspiring. Maybe it’s 2023 perspective, but I'm realizing that the journey, the effort, the *growth* – that’s just as valuable as a championship. It’s a quieter, more thoughtful kind of fandom.



Hope you enjoyed!
