The woes of being a sports card enthusiast in 2023! I'm still trying to wrap my head around the recent updates to our favorite listing platform. The new 'Card Condition' field is a great idea, don't get me wrong, but it's caused chaos for many of us. Now, I have to revisit each of my multivariation listings and update the condition for every single variation. To make matters worse, the 'Condition' dropdown is greyed out for ungrazed cards - I'm stuck! I've tried troubleshooting, but it's like hitting a brick wall. It's frustrating, to say the least. I'm all for providing accurate information, but this new requirement has turned a simple task into a tedious chore. I'm holding out hope that the platform will revisit this update and make some adjustments. Until then, I'll be over here, manually updating my listings one by one.
