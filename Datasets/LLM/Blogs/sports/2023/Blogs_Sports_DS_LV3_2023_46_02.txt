### The Dream Car That Almost Was: My Brush with a DeLorean Scam

I’ve always been a dreamer. Not in a vague, “wouldn’t-it-be-nice” kind of way, but with a specific, obsessive focus. For the last decade, that focus has been a DeLorean DMC-12. It’s not just a car; it’s a stainless-steel time capsule, a piece of movie magic, a monument to ambition and failure. It’s the car I promised my younger, *Back to the Future*-obsessed self I would own one day.

In the spring of 2023, after years of saving and scouring auction sites, I thought my moment had finally arrived. I was scrolling through a niche classic car forum when I saw it: a 1981 DeLorean, seemingly in pristine condition, listed for a price that made my heart skip a beat. It was low. Suspiciously low. The kind of low that whispers, “This is too good to be true,” but your heart, thumping in your chest, shouts back, “But what if it IS?”

This is the story of how I almost lost a significant chunk of my life savings to that whisper, and the glaring red flags I learned to see only when my desperation started to fade.

The seller, let’s call him “Jean,” was based in Portugal. He explained in polished, friendly English that he was an engineer who had inherited the car from an uncle and had no emotional attachment to it. He just wanted it to go to a good home. The price, he claimed, was a reflection of his desire for a quick, straightforward sale. My first flicker of unease was immediately rationalized. *International shipping?* Well, of course, a rare car like this could be anywhere. It made it feel more exotic, more destined.

We moved our conversation to a private messaging app. The photos he sent were stunning—grainy in that perfect, nostalgic way, the gull-wing doors lifted towards a sunny Iberian sky. He was responsive, answering my technical questions with a surprising amount of detail. He’d even send me a "good morning" message, asking how my day was going. He was building rapport, and I was a willing participant.

Then we got to the meat of it: the payment. I suggested flying out to see the car. A flurry of excuses followed. His mother was ill, he was about to be deployed for a work project, the timing was impossible. Instead, he had a "foolproof" solution. He knew a trusted, third-party **shipping** company that could handle everything. The car would be crated, insured, and sent to the port of Baltimore. I could inspect it upon arrival, and only then would the funds be released.

It sounded… logical. Complicated, but logical. He was removing the burden from me. But when I asked for the name of this shipping company to do my own due diligence, he became vague. “They prefer to work directly with the seller to coordinate logistics,” he said. The second red flag, now waving a little more vigorously.

The final, and most critical, conversation was about the money. I’m not a
