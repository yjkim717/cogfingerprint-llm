**Would Joel Embiid Dominate Elsewhere? A Playoff Question That Keeps Me Up**

It's been a wild NBA Playoffs so far, hasn't it? Seeing Joel Embiid carrying the Sixers is incredible, but it also got me thinking… how much of his playoff success is tied to *who* he’s faced?

Looking back at his series wins – Brooklyn Nets, Toronto Raptors, and so on – you can't help but wonder. Would he have the same impact, the same dominance, if he were battling it out in the Western Conference? The West feels *different*, tougher, deeper.

It’s not meant to diminish what he’s achieved, far from it. But as a fan, it's that 'what if' that lingers after every hard-fought victory. Maybe it’s just the late-night games talking, but it’s a question I can’t shake. What do you think?
