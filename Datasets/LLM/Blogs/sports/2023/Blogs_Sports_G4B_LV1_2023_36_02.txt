**The Unexpected Geometry of Football Names**

Okay, I know this sounds a little… weird. But I’ve been completely obsessed with something lately, and it started with a really random blog post. It was analyzing NFL player names using this system called AWANOL – basically, measuring the width of the letters to figure out which names are “fattest” and which are “skinniest.” Seriously.

I know, it sounds like a bizarre hobby, but it actually sparked something interesting. I’ve always been a bit of a numbers person, and I realized I’d never really *looked* at the names of the guys on the field, beyond their jersey numbers and playing positions. I just assumed they were… names. 

But when you break them down, it's fascinating. Names like “Jackson” and “Carter” are undeniably wider, sprawling out across the sidelines. Then you have names like “Stone” or “Finn,” which are more compact, almost tight. It’s a visual thing, really. 

It made me think about how these names, these little pieces of identity, are constantly being displayed, shouted across stadiums, emblazoned on helmets. They’re part of the whole spectacle of football, and yet, I hadn't connected them to this kind of visual detail before. 

This year, watching the season unfold, I found myself subconsciously noticing the letter widths of the names. Was “Miles” particularly broad this season? Did “Hayes” seem a little more streamlined? It’s a silly little obsession, I admit. But it’s a reminder that even in the most high-octane, adrenaline-fueled sport, there’s a quiet beauty to be found in the details – even the geometry of a football player’s name.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
