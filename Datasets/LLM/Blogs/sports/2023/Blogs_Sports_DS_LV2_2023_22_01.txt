That final buzzer in 2023 still echoes. After a decade of chasing that championship, my last shot didn't just rim outâ€”it felt like the hoop itself moved. I'd followed the playbook perfectly: the dawn workouts, the strict diet, the film study. Yet, there I was, watching another team celebrate. Sometimes, despite doing everything "right," the ball just doesn't bounce your way. And learning to accept that has been its own kind of victory.
