## Chasing Light and Miles: A Winter Running Reflection

The days are short now, aren't they? That familiar bite of winter air hangs around, and the sun seems to set before you’ve even really gotten going. But honestly? That’s when I love to run the most. 

There’s something about the quiet stillness of a winter morning, the way the light catches the frost on the trees, that just… clears everything out. I've been trying to capture a bit of that magic lately, snapping photos along my routes. It started as a simple way to document my progress, but it's quickly become something more. 

This week, I found myself running along the canal, the water reflecting the muted grey sky. It wasn't a particularly scenic shot, but the feeling of pushing through the chill, the rhythm of my feet on the pavement – that's what I wanted to remember. 

It makes me think about how we often chase those big, dramatic moments, the perfect sunrise, the record-breaking run. But sometimes, the real beauty lies in the everyday grit, in the simple act of showing up and moving forward, even when the light is fading. And sharing those smaller moments, those quiet victories, can be just as inspiring.



Hopefully, I can capture some more light and miles to share soon!
