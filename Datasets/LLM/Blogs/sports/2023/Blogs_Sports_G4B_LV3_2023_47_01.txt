**The Weight of the Box Out**

There’s something about getting knocked around that really gets under your skin, right? Lately, I’ve been battling this frustrating feeling in my local men’s league – consistently getting dominated by guys who are shorter and stockier than me. It’s not about raw power, not really. It’s about the little things: post positioning, box outs, even just *spacing* on the court. 

I started obsessing. Was it a technique problem? Was I just not aggressive enough? Honestly, I questioned my whole *mentality* – was I letting the frustration get to me?  I realized it wasn't just about the next play, but about consistently fighting for every rebound, every inch. 

This season, I’m focusing on staying lower, anticipating the ball, and trusting my instincts. It’s a reminder that even in sports, and maybe in life, sometimes the battle is less about brute strength and more about stubborn persistence.
