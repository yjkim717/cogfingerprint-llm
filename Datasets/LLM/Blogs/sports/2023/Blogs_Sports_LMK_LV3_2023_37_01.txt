As I reflect on PwC's new return-to-office policy, I'm reminded of the parallels between hybrid work arrangements and team sports. Just as a basketball team needs a mix of players on the court and a solid strategy on the bench, companies are finding that a balance between office and remote work is key. PwC's policy, requiring hybrid employees to be in the office 50% of the time, got me thinking - what's the playbook for success in this new era? For athletes, being on the field and practicing together is crucial for building teamwork and trust. Similarly, being in the office can foster collaboration and innovation. However, just as athletes need rest days to recharge, employees need flexibility to be productive. As we navigate this hybrid landscape in 2023, it's clear that finding the right balance is crucial for both employees and employers to score big.
