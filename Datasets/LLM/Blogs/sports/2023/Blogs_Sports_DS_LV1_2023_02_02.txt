### Structural Considerations for a Long-Span Outdoor Roof

A common question in custom outdoor projects is whether standard lumber can achieve longer spans. For an 18-foot span supporting a roof, simply doubling up 2x10 beams is a complex calculation. The final load capacity depends heavily on the wood species, grade, spacing of the joists they support, and the total dead and live loads (like snow). While it's a plausible solution for some light-duty applications, a structural engineer should always be consulted to review the specific design, ensuring the doubled lumber is properly connected and the entire assembly is safe and meets local building codes.
