### The Human Element in the Polls

It’s that time of year again. The crisp squeak of sneakers on the court is back, and so is my Monday morning ritual: frantically refreshing the AP Top 25 to see where my team landed.

This week, I fell down a rabbit hole. A sports analytics blog broke down the voters themselves, highlighting the "most consistent" and the infamous "outlier voters." One voter, in particular, had my team ranked a baffling eight spots lower than anyone else.

My first reaction was pure frustration. Who was this person? Did they even watch the games?

But then, in our hyper-analyzed 2023 sports world, I found a strange comfort in that outlier. That vote wasn’t generated by an algorithm crunching efficiency metrics. It was a human with an opinion, maybe a flawed one, but a genuine perspective shaped by what they saw—or what they valued.

It reminded me that for all the data we worship, sports are still about people. The players, of course, but also the fans, the writers, and even that one voter who sees the game a little differently. That inconsistency is messy, debatable, and utterly human. And honestly, the debates it sparks are half the fun of being a fan.
