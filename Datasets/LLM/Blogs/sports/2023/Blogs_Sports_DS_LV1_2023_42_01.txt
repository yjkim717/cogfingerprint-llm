### A Glimpse in the Rearview Mirror

I was scrolling through some old college football clips the other day—specifically, the 1973 showdown between Oklahoma and Texas. It felt less like watching a game and more like observing a different sport entirely.

The wishbone offense was a beautiful, brutal machine of misdirection. It was all about the option: the quarterback reading a single defender in a split-second, making a choice, and unleashing a relentless ground attack. Passing was an afterthought, a risky surprise play. For those teams, a season's worth of pass attempts might not even cover a single half for some of today's top programs.

It makes you think. In 2023, we celebrate the 400-yard passing performance, the quarterback as a gunslinger. But watching those grainy films, there's an undeniable artistry in that old-school, run-first identity. It was a game of physical chess played between the tackles, where three yards and a cloud of dust wasn't a failure, but a strategy. Sometimes, looking back reminds you that the game’s soul isn't just in how it changes, but in what it used to be.
