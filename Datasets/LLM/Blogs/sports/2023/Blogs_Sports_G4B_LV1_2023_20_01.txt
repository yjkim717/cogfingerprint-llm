Anyone else feel like sometimes the *details* get lost in the excitement? I was scrolling through the JMR marble run event thread last week, and it struck me – where’s the scoreboard? It’s like watching a brilliant wave event unfold, with incredible team placement, but without a final tally. 

It reminded me of baseball – you *need* that score!  I started thinking about how we sometimes focus so much on the individual moments, we forget the overall narrative.  Maybe JMR needs a little more data visualization – a way to really capture the total runs and the grand scheme of things.
