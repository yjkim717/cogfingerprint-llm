**The Hub That Wouldn’t Hub**

Okay, let me tell you about a mini-crisis I had last month. I’d finally taken the plunge and invested in a new smart hub – part of my Zwift setup, you know, for those indoor rides. Everything *looked* amazing, sleek and promising. But then, on a particularly challenging climb in Zwift, I felt this weird stutter in my pedaling. It wasn’t smooth, it wasn’t consistent. 

I started troubleshooting, naturally. I checked my connections, my Zwift settings – everything seemed fine. Then it hit me: the cassette on my bike. It’s a slightly older setup, and I realized the hub’s cassette might have a different tooth spacing than what my bike was used to. 

Turns out, that subtle difference was throwing everything off. A quick adjustment to the derailleur solved the problem, and I was back to enjoying my virtual climbs! It’s a good reminder that even the newest tech needs to play nicely with the older bits – and sometimes, a little investigation is all it takes. #Zwift #SmartTrainer #CyclingProblems
