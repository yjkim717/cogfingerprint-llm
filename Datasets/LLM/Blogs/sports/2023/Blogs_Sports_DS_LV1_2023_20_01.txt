**The Scoreboard Tells the Whole Story**

You know that feeling in 2023, when you’re watching a game and something just feels… off? I had that moment recently while catching up on Jelle’s Marble Runs. It was the Wave event, and after each thrilling run, the scoreboard would reset. We saw the points for that single run, but the cumulative team totals? Nowhere to be found.

It struck me how vital that running total is. It’s the narrative. Imagine a baseball game that only showed you the score for each inning, forcing you to do the math yourself to know who’s actually winning. You’d lose the tension, the momentum, the story of the comeback.

That simple running total is more than just numbers; it’s the heartbeat of the competition. It connects each moment to the larger battle, letting us invest in the journey, not just a series of isolated sprints. It’s a lesson any sport, real or marble, should remember.
