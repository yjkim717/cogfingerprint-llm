**Sunday Rituals: Saints vs. Bucs – More Than Just a Game**

There’s something about Sunday afternoons in late October that just feels…important. For me, it always starts with the Saints game thread. Seriously, I’ve become a bit of a fixture there – scrolling through predictions, sharing a nervous laugh at the latest meme, and just generally feeling connected to a shared experience. 

This week it’s New Orleans versus Tampa Bay. It’s not *just* about football, you know? It’s about a weekly tradition, a way to unwind and talk about something bigger than myself. It’s a reminder that even amidst the chaos of 2023, there are still little pockets of community and connection – and a whole lot of hope for the Saints.  What’s *your* gameday ritual?
