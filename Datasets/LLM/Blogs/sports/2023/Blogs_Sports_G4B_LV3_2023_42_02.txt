It’s funny how a hockey game can feel so…personal, isn’t it? I was watching the college regionals this weekend, and the contrast in attendance was striking. Fargo and Allentown were buzzing – nearly full arenas! Then there was Manchester, where it felt like a smaller, quieter affair. You wonder about the stories behind those numbers.  Maybe it’s the weather, maybe it's local pride, or just a reflection of how invested a community is.  It really makes you appreciate the energy of a packed rink.
