## The Thrill of the Run, and Seeing Where You Stand

There's something so captivating about watching a good marble run, right? The twists, the turns, the sheer ingenuity! I was at a local "JMR Wave Event" recently – a fantastic gathering for marble run enthusiasts – and it got me thinking about competition. It’s exciting to push yourself, but sometimes, a little more clarity can amplify the fun.

Someone suggested displaying cumulative scores after each run. It seems simple, but imagine the added excitement! Knowing where you stack up, even a little, fuels that drive. It’s a reminder that every run matters, and it adds another layer of engagement for both the runners and the audience. Makes you wonder – how can we bring that feeling of incremental progress to *any* challenge we face?
