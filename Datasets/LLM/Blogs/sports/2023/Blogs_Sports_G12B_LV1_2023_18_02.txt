Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided keywords (ammonium issue, soil acidifier, leaf discoloration, stem health) and the overall theme of a problem needing careful attention, but framed within a sports context. I've aimed for a conversational tone and storytelling, set in 2023, and around the 170-word mark.

## The Late-Season Wilt: Lessons from the Raptors' Struggles

This year’s Raptors season…oof. It wasn’t a complete disaster, but that late-season slump felt brutal to watch. We saw flashes of brilliance, those moments where you thought, "Okay, *this* is the team we hoped for." Then, suddenly, a wilting. Players looking tired, shots falling short, and a general lack of spark.

It got me thinking about gardening, actually. Remember how my blueberry bushes went haywire last summer? Purple leaves, drooping stems… turns out, an ammonium imbalance was starving them of what they needed. It needed some serious soil correction, a bit of acidifier to get things right.

The Raptors felt similar. Maybe it wasn't one glaring issue, but a bunch of things – fatigue, maybe a lack of cohesion – slowly poisoning the team's performance.  It’s a reminder that even with talent, you need the right conditions to thrive.  Hopefully, Masai and the coaching staff can do their “soil correction” this offseason and come back stronger in 2024.
