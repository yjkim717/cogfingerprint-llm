As I laced up my running shoes this morning in the crisp 2023 air, I couldn't help but think of the countless hours I spent on the track as a teenager. I was training for the state championships, fueled by a mix of determination and naivety. Fast forward to today, I'm still logging miles, but now it's about personal bests, not podium finishes. The lessons I learned on the track - perseverance, discipline, and resilience - remain the same. Just like a well-insulated attic, a strong foundation is key to achieving my goals.
