## The Unexpected Disappointment of a Missed Chance

Anyone else feel a little…deflated this year? Like, beyond the usual sports heartbreak? I was genuinely looking forward to Todd’s annual best and worst list. It’s a silly tradition, I know, but it's always a fun recap. Then I saw that *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* font meme…and realized the absolute comedic gold he missed! Imagine "Worst Call of the Year" in that stark, serious Oppenheimer typeface! It just felt like a perfect, playful moment lost.  It’s a small thing, sure, but it highlighted how sometimes the best humor is in the unexpected pairings. Anyone else have a 2023 pop culture/sports mashup they were hoping for?
