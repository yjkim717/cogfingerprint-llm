There’s something timeless about the rhythm of college football season—the crisp air on game day, the roar of the crowd, and the endless debates over rankings and rivalries. I was reminded of that feeling recently while listening to Phil Steele on a podcast, breaking down his 2023 preview magazine. His insights into coaching strategies and team dynamics felt like reconnecting with an old friend who just gets it.

It made me reflect on how much the sport grounds us, year after year. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual observer, there’s comfort in that familiar anticipation. Here’s to another season of unforgettable moments and shared stories.
