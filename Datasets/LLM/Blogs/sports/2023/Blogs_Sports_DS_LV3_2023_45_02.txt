It’s 2023, and as the NBA playoffs unfold, I can’t help but think about Joel Embiid. He’s undeniably dominant in the regular season—a true force who finally claimed his MVP trophy. But when the pressure mounts in a playoff series, the doubts creep in.

Most of his series wins have come against teams that, let’s be honest, weren’t exactly powerhouses. It makes you wonder: what if his career had unfolded out West? Night after night, facing the depth and grit of the Western Conference—would his legacy look different? Would those explosive performances translate into deep playoff runs, or would the constant battle wear him down?

It’s the kind of "what if" that haunts a player’s story. For Embiid, the question isn’t just about talent—it’s about context, competition, and how we measure greatness when the stakes are highest.
