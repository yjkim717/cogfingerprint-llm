The final buzzer echoed through the arena, capping a perfect weekend celebrating my team’s huge win. The high, however, was about to be grounded. Our flight home with Alaska Airlines sat on the tarmac for three agonizing hours due to an air traffic control snarl.

The frustration mounted. We’d finally landed, only to face a baggage claim scene of pure chaos, my suitcase one of the last to tumble onto the carousel. I was drafting a scathing review in my head, my post-vacation glow utterly extinguished.

Then, the email arrived. “A gesture of goodwill for your delay.” A $300 flight credit. Just like that, my anger dissolved. It was an unexpected assist, a reminder that sometimes, the best plays happen off the court. Alaska Airlines didn't just compensate me; they salvaged the entire memory of that epic 2023 trip.
