**Chasing Light and Miles: A Little Photo Friday Reflection**

It’s funny how a simple prompt – “Photo Friday” – can suddenly pull you back into the heart of what you love. This year, I stumbled across a vibrant running community on Reddit, specifically a dedicated subreddit for sharing running photos. It sparked something in me. 

I’ve always loved capturing the feeling of a run – the golden light hitting the trail, the camaraderie of fellow runners, that sheer grit of pushing past a tough mile.  Sharing those images felt like more than just posting a picture; it was a way to connect with others who understand that same quiet joy. 

Scrolling through those running routes and smiling faces reminded me why I lace up my shoes in the first place. It’s not about speed or competition, but about the journey and the shared experience.  Maybe you'll find your own running community – or just a beautiful photo – this weekend!
