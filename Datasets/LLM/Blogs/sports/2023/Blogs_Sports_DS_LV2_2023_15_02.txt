It’s 2023, and I’m still chasing the high of that perfect game-winning shot. You know the one—where the crowd holds its breath, then erupts in a roar that shakes the stadium. For me, sports aren’t just about scores; they’re about moments that stick with you, like a favorite song that brings back a flood of memories. It’s funny how a simple play can connect us, reminding us why we fell in love with the game in the first place.
