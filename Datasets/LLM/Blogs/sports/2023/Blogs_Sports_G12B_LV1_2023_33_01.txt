>## The End of an Era (For Now?)

It's funny how quickly things can change in the world of college football. Just a few weeks ago, the Pac-12 was riding high, the *last* undefeated conference standing. We were all marveling at this 19-game winning streak, a testament to the late-season surges of teams like Washington and Oregon. It felt like a real statement, a chance for the Pac-12 to assert itself on the national stage.

Then, *wham*. A single loss. And just like that, the streak was gone. It’s a reminder that in sports, invincibility is an illusion. It’s a tough pill to swallow, no doubt, especially for Pac-12 fans. But it also opens up a fascinating new chapter. The ACC and Big 12 are looking strong, and the race for the playoff is now even more chaotic and compelling. It's a wild ride, isn’t it? And that’s what makes college football so great.
