I'm still buzzing from last night's game. As I watched the underdog team pull off a stunning upset, I couldn't help but think about my own athletic endeavors. In 2023, I'm more determined than ever to get back into shape. Just like that team, I'm ready to refinance my fitness goals and drive towards a stronger me - all while keeping my finances in check, just like I'd refinance a car loan to a lower APR.
