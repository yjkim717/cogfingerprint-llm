It’s 2023, and I’m thinking about Andrew Luck again. Remember him? The guy who, in a league full of top-three draft picks, threw more passes than any of them before walking away. It makes you wonder—what does "success" even mean in the NFL? Stats like his 1,813 attempts tell one story, but the quiet exit tells another. Sometimes, the most impressive records are the ones a player chooses to leave behind.
