**The Annoying Silence of the Game**

There’s something incredibly frustrating about a sports broadcast cutting out mid-play. I was totally invested in last weekend’s game – a nail-biter between the Eagles and the Chiefs – and suddenly, just *poof*, silence. Amazon Music Unlimited was streaming, but the audio dropped out completely. It wasn’t a one-time thing; it happened a few times throughout the game. 

It really highlighted how reliant we’ve become on seamless streaming, and how jarring it is when it fails.  It’s more than just a minor inconvenience; it’s that feeling of being disconnected from the experience.  A frustrating subscription, indeed!  Makes you appreciate the simple joy of uninterrupted sound.
