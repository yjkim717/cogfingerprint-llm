The recent closure of Lantern, a prominent cannabis delivery service in Massachusetts, got me thinking about the parallels between the cannabis industry and professional sports. Just as athletes face hurdles on their path to success, the cannabis industry is navigating its own set of challenges. Regulatory issues and the looming threat of federal legalization are significant obstacles. 

In 2023, it's clear that the cannabis industry is in its own version of "overtime." Companies must adapt to changing rules and consumer demands. Just as a team's strategy can make or break their season, the cannabis industry's ability to overcome regulatory hurdles will determine its success. As we watch this industry evolve, it's evident that only the most resilient and innovative players will come out on top. The question is, who's ready for the next quarter?
