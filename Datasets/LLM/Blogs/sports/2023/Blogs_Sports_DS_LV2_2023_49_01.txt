The final buzzer of my high school basketball career echoed in 2023, leaving a quiet gym and a hollow feeling in my chest. For weeks, I felt lost without the structure of practice, the roar of the crowd. But then I realized the game never truly leaves you. That discipline, that drive to push through exhaustion? It’s the same fuel I use now to tackle a tough work project or a long run. The court just taught me how to win in life. The sport’s greatest gift was the person it forced me to become.
