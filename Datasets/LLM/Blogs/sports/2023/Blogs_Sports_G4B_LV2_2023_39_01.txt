**That Heartbreak in the Final Seconds**

You know those moments in sports that just…stick with you? Last fall, watching my local college team lose in the championship game felt like a punch to the gut. We were *so* close. Down by one point with seconds left, a desperation heave for the win fell short.

It reminded me that sometimes, the biggest disappointments aren’t about the outcome, but the journey and the shared experience. 

It’s okay to feel gutted, right?  Those tough losses, those unexpected turns – they shape you.  And honestly, it made the eventual victory in the consolation bracket feel *so* much sweeter.  What’s a moment like that done for you?
