## That Feeling of Captured Motion

Isn't it amazing how a single photo can freeze a moment? I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day celebrating running photos, and it got me thinking. We pour so much into our runs – the early mornings, the aching muscles, the mental grit – but a picture? It can encapsulate all of that in a single frame. 

Seeing those shared images, vibrant with motion and determination, reminded me of my own races. Not the podium finishes, but the blurry shots of pushing through mile 20, that look of sheer effort. They're a powerful reminder of what we overcome. It’s a little thing, but sharing those moments, celebrating the journey, feels pretty good, right? What’s *your* favorite running photo memory?
