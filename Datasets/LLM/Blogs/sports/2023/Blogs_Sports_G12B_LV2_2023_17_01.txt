## The Unexpected Joy of Being a Late Bloomer (in Pickleball!)

Okay, full confession: I’m *terrible* at sports. Always have been. Gym class was a source of constant low-key anxiety. But this year, 2023, something shifted. I picked up pickleball. Yes, *pickleball*. I know, it's everywhere, right?

Initially, I was just going with friends, expecting to be the laughingstock of the court. And honestly, for the first few weeks, I pretty much was. Missed serves, clumsy footwork, the whole nine yards. But something kept me coming back. 

It wasn't about winning (because, let's be real, I wasn't). It was about the feeling of *improvement*, however small. Finally nailing a dink, returning a surprisingly tricky shot... those little victories felt huge. 

It's a good reminder, isn't it? That it’s never too late to try something new, even if you're starting from scratch. And that sometimes, the joy isn’t in being the best, but in the simple act of getting a little bit better, one paddle swing at a time. Anyone else finding unexpected passions later in life? Let me know!
