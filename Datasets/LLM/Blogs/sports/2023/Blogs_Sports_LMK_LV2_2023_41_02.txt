"The Unpredictable Start: AP Poll Voter Consistency in College Basketball's Preseason"

As the 2023 college basketball season tips off, the AP Poll is once again flooded with diverse opinions. I've always been fascinated by the preseason rankings - a time when voters' personal biases and team loyalties are on full display. Analyzing AP Poll voter consistency, I discovered that some voters tend to follow the crowd, while others boldly chart their own course. 

By examining the data, I ranked voters by their similarity to the group, revealing a spectrum of opinions. Some voters stuck closely to the pack, while others diverged, showcasing their unique perspectives. This diversity is what makes the preseason so intriguing. As the season unfolds, will voters converge or continue to diverge? One thing's for sure - the ride will be unpredictable, and that's what makes college basketball so thrilling.
