That championship loss still stings months later. I keep replaying that final play in my head—the split-second decision that cost us everything. But 2023 taught me that defeat carves deeper lessons than victory ever could. It’s in the quiet gym at dawn, the extra drills when no one’s watching, where character is forged. The scoreboard doesn’t show the resilience we’re building. Next season, we won’t just be stronger players; we’ll be a tighter team, hungry and united. Sometimes, falling short is just the setup for a greater comeback.
