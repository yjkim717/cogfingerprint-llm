The final buzzer echoed through the empty 2023 stadium, my last game. For years, I chased the highlight-reel dunk, the complex play. But sitting here, I realize my most valuable moments weren't the spectacular scores, but the fundamentals mastered in a silent gym—the simple layups, the free throws. It’s the same for any beginner; don't start by trying to build the championship play. Fall in love with the daily practice, the sweat, the grind. The foundation is where the real magic, and the joy, is built.
