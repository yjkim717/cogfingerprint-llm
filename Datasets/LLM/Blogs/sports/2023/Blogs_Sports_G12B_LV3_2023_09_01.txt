## The Ghost of the Stadium and the Future of Feeling

Remember that feeling? The roar of the crowd, the electric anticipation before a big play, the shared heartbreak or unadulterated joy of a win? It’s a feeling I chased my whole childhood, sitting in the stands, absorbing the energy of the game. 

But lately, watching from home, even with the best surround sound, something feels… missing. We're so obsessed with data, with stats and projections, that we risk losing the *feeling* of sport. It’s easy to get caught up in the analysis, detached from the raw emotion.

I wonder, will the future of sports be all about personalized experiences delivered through our screens? Will AR overlays and customized stats replace the communal experience? I hope not. I hope we find a way to blend the incredible technology available to us with the irreplaceable magic of being *there*, connected to the energy of the crowd and the shared human experience of a game. Because that’s the heart of why we love sports, isn’t it?
