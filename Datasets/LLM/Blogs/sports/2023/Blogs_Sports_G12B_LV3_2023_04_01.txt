## Where'd Jacoby Jones Go? A Sports Media Mystery.

Anyone else notice Jacoby Jones just… vanished from ESPN? It’s been a while, and I keep thinking about his insightful takes. He always felt like a genuinely smart voice amidst the noise. I saw a thread on Reddit the other day echoing the same thought – where'd he go? 

It got me wondering if he'd be a perfect fit at The Ringer. Imagine Jacoby breaking down plays with Bill Simmons and a team of sharp analytics minds! That would be *chef's kiss*. It's funny how quickly someone can disappear from the sports media landscape. Hopefully, he's doing well and maybe, just maybe, we’ll see him back in the game soon.
