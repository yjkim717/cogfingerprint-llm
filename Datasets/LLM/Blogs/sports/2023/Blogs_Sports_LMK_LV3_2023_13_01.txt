"Is Aero Flying Under the Radar in MarvelSnap?"

As I dove back into MarvelSnap this week, I couldn't help but feel that Aero, a card I've grown fond of, is getting a raw deal. With its unique ability to disrupt opponents' strategies, Aero feels like an unsung hero. Compared to other cards with similar effects, Aero's power level seems underwhelming. I think it's time for a buff. A boost to its abilities would not only make it more competitive but also more exciting to play. The current meta is all about strategy and finesse, and Aero's subtle yet impactful playstyle fits right in. By giving Aero the love it deserves, players can enjoy a more balanced and dynamic gameplay experience. Let's give Aero the wings it needs to soar â€“ a buff is long overdue!
