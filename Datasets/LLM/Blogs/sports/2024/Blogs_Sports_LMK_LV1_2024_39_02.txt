I'm still grinning thinking about our 2024 backyard BBQs. With our new outdoor kitchen, al fresco dining has become the norm. The L-shaped layout, anchored by a sleek built-in grill, is perfect for whipping up feasts. As we prep for our next gathering, I'm on the hunt for durable cabinetry that can withstand our saltwater waterfront views. Any cabinet brand recommendations for a PNW outdoor kitchen that can brave the elements?
