### The Unseen Beauty of a Perfect Game

I was scrolling through my phone the other day, one of those endless digital scrolls that usually ends with me wondering what I was even looking for, when a stat caught my eye. Since 2007, there have been only 34 “perfect games” in college football.

Not perfect as in a pitcher’s perfect game. Something different. Something, in a way, more pure.

It’s when an FBS team scores a touchdown on *every single offensive drive* before the backups come in during garbage time. No punts. No field goals. No kneel-downs to end a half. Just drive after relentless drive, ending in six points.

Thirty-four times. In nearly two decades of college football, with thousands of games played, it’s only happened thirty-four times.

I leaned back from my screen, and my mind didn’t go to the powerhouse Alabama teams or the offensive fireworks of LSU. It went to a high school field on a chilly Friday night twenty years ago. I was a sophomore, third-string everything, but I remember our starting quarterback, a kid named Mark. In one game, he was… untouchable. It wasn’t that he was throwing 60-yard bombs; it was that every play he called seemed to be the right one. Every check at the line was prescient. We’d get the ball, and you just *knew* we were going to score. It was an effortless, flowing certainty.

We only put up 35 points that night, but in the context of our level, it was one of those “perfect” offensive performances. I remember the quiet on the bus ride home. It wasn’t a raucous celebration. It was a kind of awe. We had participated in something that felt bigger than a win. We had witnessed a fleeting moment of sporting perfection.

And that’s what I think about with those 34 college teams. We celebrate the Heisman winners and the national champions, and rightly so. But these “perfect games” are their own unique monuments. They aren’t about a season-long grind; they’re about a single, crystalline afternoon where everything clicked. The offensive line, the quarterback’s reads, the receiver’s routes, the play-calling—all of it fused into one unstoppable force.

It’s a beautiful reminder that perfection isn’t always about a shiny, unblemished record. Sometimes, it’s hidden in the flow of a single game. It’s a three-hour masterpiece of efficiency and execution that, for the players on that field, must feel like time itself has slowed down just for them.

I wonder if any of those players felt that same, quiet awe on their bus ride home. I like to think they did.
