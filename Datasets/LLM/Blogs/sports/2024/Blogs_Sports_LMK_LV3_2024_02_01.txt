When my Apple Watch Series 8 stopped working just a month after its warranty expired, I was frustrated. As an avid runner, relying on it to track my progress, I felt lost. Rather than buying a new one, I explored repair options. After troubleshooting the issue, I discovered that a simple fix could get it working again. This experience taught me to be more resourceful and less impulsive with tech purchases. Now, in 2024, I'm more mindful of extending the life of my devices, much like I do with my running gear, to get the most out of my investments.
