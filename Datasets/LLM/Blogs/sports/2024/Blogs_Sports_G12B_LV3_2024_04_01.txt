## Beyond the Play-In: Do the Lakers Deserve the Doubt?

Okay, let's talk Lakers. I saw Charles Barkley’s take the other day – essentially saying their playoff spot was *all* thanks to the play-in tournament. And honestly? It rubbed me the wrong way. 

I get the skepticism. The West is brutal. But dismissing their entire season like that feels a bit harsh. Looking back, I genuinely think a Lakers team with this core could have snuck into the playoffs in a couple of the past few years, even *without* the play-in. 

It’s easy to focus on the tournament, but they’ve shown flashes of real brilliance. Maybe they aren't championship contenders *yet*, but writing them off entirely? I’m not buying it. What do you all think?
