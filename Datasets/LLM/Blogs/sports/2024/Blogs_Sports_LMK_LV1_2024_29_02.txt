I'm swapping my running shoes for flip flops this January 2024! I'm torn between Aruba and Curacao for a chill beach vacation. Both islands promise crystal-clear waters and powdery white sand. I'm looking for a relaxing getaway with some snorkeling thrown in. Has anyone been to both? Which one did you prefer? I'm dreaming of lazy mornings, turquoise lagoons, and exploring underwater worlds. Help me decide - Aruba or Curacao? Let's trade recommendations and make this beach vacation a reality!
