As a lifelong band nerd, my 2024 highlight wasn't a championship game, but hearing Texas Tech's "Fight, Raiders, Fight" echo through a silent stadium after a tough loss. It’s in those moments you realize these songs aren't about winning; they're the steady heartbeat of a community. That shared spirit in South Carolina's alma mater or the pride in Iowa State's fight song—that’s the real victory, long after the scoreboard fades.
