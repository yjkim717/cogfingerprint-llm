It’s 2024, and I’m still wrestling with a puzzle that keeps me up at night: how do you protect the rim when the other team’s big man is camping at the three-point line? We run a solid man-to-man, but these 5-out offenses stretch us to the breaking point. Every defensive switch feels like a gamble—do we stay home and risk an open three, or help inside and leave a shooter? It’s a constant, exhausting dance, and honestly, it’s changed how I see positioning forever. The game’s evolving, and some days, it feels like we’re just trying to keep up.
