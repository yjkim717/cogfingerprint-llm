It’s 2024, and basketball’s chess match has never been clearer. I remember coaching against a relentless 5-out offense, our man-to-man defense stretched to its limits. We had to choose: protect the rim or smother the perimeter? The real answer was neither—it was about positioning and trust. Constant communication, timely switches, and denying those easy post-ups became our mantra. It’s a delicate dance, but when everyone’s locked in, you don’t just stop plays; you build something unbreakable together.
