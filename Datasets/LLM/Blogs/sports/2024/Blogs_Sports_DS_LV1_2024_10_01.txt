There’s something electric about a game that goes down to the wire. Watching the Heat and Jazz trade buckets last night, I was reminded why I love this sport. It’s not just the final score of 126-120; it’s the raw emotion, the clutch plays, the sheer will to win. In 2024, with so much noise in the world, a pure, hard-fought basketball game feels like a welcome anchor. It’s a beautiful reminder of human competition at its finest.
