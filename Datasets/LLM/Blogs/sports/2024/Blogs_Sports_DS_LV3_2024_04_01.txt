You know, it’s funny how narratives take hold in sports. I was listening to Charles Barkley the other day, and he joked that the Lakers only sniffed the playoffs this year because of the play-in tournament. It’s a catchy take, the kind Bill Simmons might riff on for a whole podcast.

But then I saw the data. And the numbers tell a different story. Looking back at the historical seeding, the Lakers would have been in anyway, play-in or not.

It just goes to show how easily we get swept up in a good storyline, even when the facts aren’t there to back it up. In 2024, with hot takes flying faster than ever, it’s a good reminder to sometimes just look at the scoreboard. The truth is often quieter than the debate, but it’s always worth seeking out.
