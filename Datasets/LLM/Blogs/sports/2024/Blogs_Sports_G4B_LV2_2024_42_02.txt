**The Ghosts of Free Throws Past**

Anyone else feel a little… nostalgic for the basics sometimes? Lately, I’ve been watching a lot of college hoops, and it’s got me thinking about something frustrating: a genuine lack of fundamentals. Specifically, I’m thinking about the University of Minnesota Gophers. 

It’s not about expecting miracles – these are young athletes – but watching them struggle with simple things like free throws just feels disheartening. It’s like they’re missing the core of the game.  

I remember my own high school days, obsessing over perfecting my free throw form. It wasn’t glamorous, it wasn't flashy, but it was *fundamental*. It felt like building a solid foundation. 

Seeing teams skip over those crucial details, prioritizing speed or a complex scheme over the simple act of shooting straight, is a bummer. It makes you wonder if we’re losing sight of what truly makes a basketball team great.  Maybe it’s time to go back to basics, right?
