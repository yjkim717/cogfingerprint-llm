The first time I laced up my running shoes in 2024, my goal was simple: finish a 5k without stopping. I was so focused on my pace and breathing that I barely noticed the world around me. But something shifted on my third run. I started to see the same faces—the woman with the determined smile, the older man with his steady shuffle. We never spoke, but our shared nods became a silent pact of mutual encouragement. It’s funny how a solitary sport introduced me to my community. That feeling of quiet camaraderie, of shared purpose with strangers, is what now gets me out the door on rainy mornings. It’s no longer just about the run; it’s about showing up for them, and for myself.
