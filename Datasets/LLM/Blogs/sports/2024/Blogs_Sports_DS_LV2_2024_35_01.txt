The stadium lights hummed, casting long shadows as I watched the 110m hurdlers warm up for the semifinals. I remember my own Olympic Trials—the electric tension, the weight of a dream balanced on a fraction of a second.

Now, from the stands, it’s different. I see the young athletes, their focus sharp, their bodies coiled like springs. Each one carries that same hope I once did. The gun will crack, and in less than 14 seconds, futures will be rewritten.

It’s not just about speed; it’s about heart. About who can hold their nerve when everything is on the line. Tonight, they’re not just racing each other—they’re racing their own limits. And win or lose, that’s a victory in itself.
