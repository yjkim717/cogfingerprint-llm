### The Unwritten Rule of the Comeback

I was watching a replay of our championship game from last season, and it got me thinking about momentum. You know the feeling—that invisible tide that turns a close game into a runaway victory. In 2024, with all our advanced analytics, we still can't bottle that magic.

It reminds me of a debate in my gaming circle about "special ammo crates" in competitive shooters. The complaint is that they create "snowballing"—the team that gets the first kill gets more power, making a comeback nearly impossible due to lopsided spawns.

And isn't that just sports? One lucky bounce, a questionable call, and suddenly the other team has all the "special ammo." Their confidence soars, the crowd gets louder, and the game can feel decided in a single, demoralizing minute.

But that’s the beautiful, brutal challenge, isn't it? The true test of a team isn't when the momentum is with us; it's when it's violently against us. The comeback is about defying that "snowball," about clawing back control when the game seems to have already written you off. It’s the hardest thing to do, and that’s precisely what makes it legendary.
