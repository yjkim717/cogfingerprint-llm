Looking back on the 2024 season, one performance still leaves me in awe: Travis Hunter. The sheer audacity to play nearly 50/50 snaps at wide receiver and cornerback is one thing, but to earn elite PFF grades on *both* sides of the ball? It redefines versatility. His elite receiving grade and elite coverage grade weren't just stats; they were a statement. In an era of specialization, Hunter was a thrilling, two-way masterpiece, reminding us just how spectacular a complete football player can be.
