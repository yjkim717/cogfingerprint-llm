**The Quiet Joy of a Slow Swim**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something as simple as swimming can feel so profoundly… restorative. This summer, after a hectic year, I rediscovered that quiet joy. I traded the pressure of training for long, slow laps in a local lake – just me, the water, and a whole lot of stillness. 

It reminded me of those perfect beach days I was dreaming about in Aruba or Curacao – that feeling of complete relaxation. Sometimes, the best victories aren’t about speed or competition, but about finding peace in the present moment. What’s your go-to way to recharge?
