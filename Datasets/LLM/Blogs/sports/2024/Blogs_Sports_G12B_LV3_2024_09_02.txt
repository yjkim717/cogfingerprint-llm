## The Little Luxuries That Matter: A Thought on the New BMW 7-Series

Okay, so I'm a bit obsessed with the new BMW 7-Series. It’s aiming squarely at the chauffeur market, all plush leather and rear-seat entertainment. And that's fantastic! But something’s been nagging at me. Where’s the chilled drink cooler? 

Seriously, the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class has had one for ages. It’s one of those little luxuries that elevates the whole experience, right? Imagine being whisked away in the back, the world blurring past, and reaching for a perfectly chilled sparkling water. It just *feels* right.

I’ve been reading some speculation online – could it be a limitation of the electric version’s power? It’s a valid point. But still, it feels like a missed opportunity. It highlights how even in the realm of ultra-luxury, it's the small details that truly define the experience. Maybe BMW will rethink it for the next generation? Here's hoping!
