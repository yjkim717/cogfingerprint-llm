Another season in the books, and I’m still puzzling over my recruiting hours in the old NCAA Football games. Why so few some years? It felt random, a cruel twist of fate. I’d dream of a perfect class, only to be capped by some hidden mechanic. It’s a funny metaphor, really. In life, like in the game, you just have to make the most of the time you’re given.
