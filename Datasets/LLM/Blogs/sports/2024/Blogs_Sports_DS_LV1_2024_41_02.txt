**Title: A Simple Fix for Reddit's Repost Problem in the X.com Era**

We finished last, together, laughing through the pain. Sport taught me how to compete, but it was in letting go of the competition that I learned about winning. The track gave me discipline, but it was that single, slow lap that gave me perspective.
