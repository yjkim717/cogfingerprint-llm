**2024: The Year I Learned to Think in Steps**

I almost threw my tablet last night. Stuck on this chess puzzle app—a “steps method” mini-game where three of my pawns had to promote and then capture a single, pesky knight. For an hour, I just moved pieces, hoping for a lucky break.

Then it hit me. I wasn't playing chess; I was just pushing wood. I stopped, breathed, and broke it down. *Step one:* get one pawn to the back rank, no matter what. *Step two:* use that new queen to create space for the next.

It’s the same in my weekend soccer league. We don’t just “score”; we build from the back, pass, and create the opportunity. That puzzle wasn’t about the knight at the end; it was about the disciplined journey of the pawns. A good reminder, in chess and in life, that the right process creates the win.
