**The Lost Art of the Dribble**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Watching college basketball these days, you see these incredible athletes, dazzling with highlight-reel passes and shots. But sometimes, it feels like the *fundamentals* are getting lost. I was thinking about the Gophers lately – a team with serious potential, but lacking a consistent, reliable base. 

You remember back to your own youth sports, right? Hours spent drilling layups, perfecting your dribble, understanding spacing. It’s the bedrock of any successful team.  

I’m not saying we need a complete overhaul, but a coach who truly emphasizes those core skills, someone who can build a team from the ground up, that’s what’s missing.  It’s a reminder that even in the era of NIL deals and flashy plays, the basics still matter.  Maybe the Gophers just need to rediscover that lost art.
