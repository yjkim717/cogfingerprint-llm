## The Grind in the Paint: Dealing with Those Relentless Post Defenders

Man, remembering those battles in the post… they stick with you, right? It’s 2024, and while the game's evolving, some things never change. You’re trying to establish position, back down your opponent, get a clean look… and then *bam* – a knee here, an arm there, a constant physical test. It's frustrating.

I was wrestling with this a lot last season. Fouling wasn't an option, but getting pushed around wasn’t working either. It felt like I was constantly giving ground. What I realized was it wasn’t about brute strength, but about *leverage*. Small shifts, subtle adjustments, using their momentum against them. Learning to anticipate their moves, to *not* back down directly, but to find that angle, that space. It's a mental game as much as a physical one. Still working on it, but it's made a world of difference. Anyone else facing this challenge? Share your strategies!
