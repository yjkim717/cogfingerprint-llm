**The Comfort of Routine and the Thrill of the Unexpected**

It’s that time of year again – the air’s crisp, the leaves are starting to turn, and my weekends are officially consumed by college football. There’s something deeply comforting about the routine, honestly. Sunday mornings spent with a mug of coffee, scrolling through those familiar /r/CFB standings, and bracing myself for another week of nail-biting games. 

This week, it’s Trivia Tuesday, of course! I’m a sucker for a good football quiz – it’s a fun way to test my knowledge and, let’s be honest, pretend I’m a serious analyst for a moment.  I love seeing those ‘Premier Tier’ teams battling it out, and it’s always a little bittersweet watching the USC Championship Tier navigate the season. 

But you know what I’ve realized lately?  While I love the predictability of the schedule, the real magic of college football isn't in the rankings. It’s in those unexpected upsets, the underdog stories, and the sheer passion of the fans.  It’s about the feeling you get when your team pulls off a victory against all odds. 

Let's see how we do this Trivia Tuesday!  What are you most looking forward to this week in college football?
