The 2024 national championship game was a historic matchup - and not just because of the thrilling finish. As I dug into the stats, I was surprised to learn that it was one of only four title games where both teams were making their first-ever appearance. It's a remarkable coincidence, considering the rich history of college football. The fact that two programs, each with their own championship drought, were finally getting their chance in the spotlight was a compelling narrative. The BCS era had created its own share of controversy, but it also set the stage for some of these long-awaited debuts. As I watched the game unfold, I couldn't help but think about the teams that had come before, waiting for their shot at glory. The 2024 championship game was more than just a bowl game - it was a milestone for two programs that had been waiting a long time to shine.
