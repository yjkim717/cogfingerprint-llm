"Was Baba's disqualification fair? In the 2024 Taskmaster challenge, Baba was penalized for 'running' instead of taking a 'brisk walk.' As a sports enthusiast, I question whether this harsh ruling was justified. The competition rules were clear, but was the penalty proportionate to the offense? Reflecting on this, I'm reminded that even the smallest infractions can greatly impact the outcome, leaving me pondering the fine line between winning and being disqualified."
