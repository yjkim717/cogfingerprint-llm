**2024: The Year I Learned to Think Two Moves Ahead**

I’ve always loved chess, but it was a frustrating puzzle in a training app that truly changed my perspective this year. The scenario was simple: I had to promote a pawn to win, but a single enemy knight stood guard, blocking every direct path. I felt stuck, just like I did after my tennis injury last season—my goal was clear, but the way forward seemed impassable.

The breakthrough came when I stopped focusing on the knight and started analyzing the entire pawn structure. I realized I could sacrifice one pawn to lure the knight away, creating a clear path for another. It was a lesson in indirect strategy.

Now, whether I'm planning my rehab or a chess endgame, I remember: sometimes you have to sacrifice a small battle to win the war. It’s all about thinking two moves ahead.
