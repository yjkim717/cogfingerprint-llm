The crisp autumn air always brings back memories of those electric Saturdays in the Big 12. It’s week 9, and the stakes are palpable. For teams like Kansas State, the dream of a bowl game is within reach—a tangible reward for a season’s grind. But my mind drifts to Oklahoma State. Just a few seasons ago, they were the talk of the title game conversations. Now, in 2024, they’re staring down potential elimination.

It’s a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can turn in sports. One year you’re on top, the next you’re fighting just to stay relevant. It’s the brutal, beautiful cycle of college football that keeps us all coming back, hearts on the line.
