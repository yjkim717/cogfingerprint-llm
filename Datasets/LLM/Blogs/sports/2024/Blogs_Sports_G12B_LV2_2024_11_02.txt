## The What-Ifs of '04: Still Stinging, Still Wondering

Anyone else still haunted by the 2004 ALCS? I swear, Red Sox fans like me carry that series around like a slightly embarrassing, yet deeply felt, emotional baggage. Seeing the Yankees celebrate *again* felt like a cosmic injustice. 

It's funny, isn't it? How one series, one moment (that pop-up!), can define a decade. Now, twenty years later, it’s easy to armchair quarterback. We analyze every managerial decision, every lineup choice. Did Bill do the right thing? Should Kevin Millar have gotten more at-bats? 

It’s a weird feeling, this hindsight. Knowing how it *should* have played out, knowing the championship that was just around the corner... it still stings. And it makes you wonder: do the guys who were *in* the game ever look back and think, "What if?" Probably. A lot.
