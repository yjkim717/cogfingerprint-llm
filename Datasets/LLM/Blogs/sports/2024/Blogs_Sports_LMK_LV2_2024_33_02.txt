The 2024 National Championship Game is shaping up to be a historic showdown. What's striking is that it's only the fourth time in college football history that both teams are making their first-ever title game appearance. This got me thinking - we're witnessing a new era in CFB, where teams are breaking through decades-long championship droughts. The BCS era, which spanned from 1998 to 2013, saw its fair share of dominant programs, but it also created a sense of stagnation for others. Fast forward to today, and we're seeing the fruits of that era's labor, with new teams emerging as contenders. As I look back on the evolution of college football, I'm excited to see these underdogs take center stage. The 2024 championship game is more than just a game - it's a milestone in the sport's ongoing narrative, marking a shift towards a more inclusive and competitive landscape.
