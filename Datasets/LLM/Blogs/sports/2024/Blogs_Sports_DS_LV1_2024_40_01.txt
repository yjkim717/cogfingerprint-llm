October 2024 is circled on my calendar—my first trip to Italy! But as a lifelong football fan, I’m not just dreaming of pasta and piazzas. I’m refreshing my browser daily, waiting for the Serie A schedule to drop. Will I get to witness a roaring San Siro or a tense relegation six-pointer? That’s the magic—not knowing which clubs will be fighting for survival or European spots by then. This trip isn’t just a vacation; it’s a pilgrimage. All I need is that fixture list to turn my Italian dream into a football reality.
