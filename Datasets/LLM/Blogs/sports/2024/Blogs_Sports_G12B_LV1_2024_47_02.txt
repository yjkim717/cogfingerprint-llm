## The Modern Game's Puzzle: Can We Still Guard the Stretch Five?

Okay, so I’ve been watching a *lot* of basketball lately, and something's been nagging at me. It’s 2024, and the league is all about spacing, right? Everyone's running a ‘5 out’ look, and while it’s beautiful to watch, it’s exposing some serious defensive vulnerabilities.

Specifically, I’m talking about how teams are struggling to deal with the modern stretch five. This big man, who’s spent years honing their outside shot, drifts out to the perimeter, pulling our traditional rim protectors *way* out of position. Suddenly, that lane's wide open, and those post-up opportunities for other players? They’re practically gift-wrapped.

We’re seeing teams get slaughtered because they’re still relying on a man-to-man defense designed for a different era. Switching everything feels like a recipe for disaster, and dropping coverage leaves gaping holes. It's a fascinating, frustrating puzzle, and I'm not sure I have the answer. What are *you* seeing out there?
