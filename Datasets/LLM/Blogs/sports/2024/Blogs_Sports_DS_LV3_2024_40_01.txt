There’s something magical about planning a trip around a shared passion. As I map out my journey to Italy this October, my mind drifts to the electric buzz of a Serie A stadium—the chants, the tension, the sheer joy. I’m eagerly refreshing my feed, waiting for that 2024/2025 schedule to drop. It’s more than just a match; it’s about weaving a memory into the fabric of my travels, feeling the heartbeat of a country through its beloved sport. Here’s to hoping the dates align perfectly.
