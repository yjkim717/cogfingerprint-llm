## Beyond the Scoreboard: Appreciating Michigan's Defensive Grit in 2023

Okay, let's be honest. We all obsess over the final score. It’s ingrained in us as fans. But sometimes, the real story lies beneath the surface, in the tireless effort and strategic brilliance that doesn't always show up on the box score. And that’s what I've been thinking about a lot lately, especially when it comes to the 2023 Michigan Wolverines defense.

I stumbled across a fascinating Reddit thread the other day – a deep dive into the stats that really paints a picture. It wasn't just about how many points they *allowed*, but *when* they allowed them. And the findings were pretty striking. Turns out, when the game was actually on the line, when it mattered most, Michigan’s defense was absolutely dominant. We're talking historically good, ranking among the best we’ve seen in recent years.

Of course, there were those late-game scores, those frustrating moments in what's often referred to as "garbage time." It’s easy to fixate on those, to see them as a weakness. But the analysis really highlighted how those moments were often the result of the other team desperately trying to catch up, not a reflection of a defensive collapse. 

It's a reminder that evaluating a team isn’t always about the final tally. It's about understanding the context, appreciating the sustained effort, and recognizing the grit that’s poured onto the field, even when the game’s already decided. 

The 2023 Wolverines defense provided a masterclass in that kind of resilience. And as we head into 2024, that’s something worth celebrating.
