## The Calm Before the Championship Storm: Are Playoff Semifinals Finally Getting Interesting?

Remember those early College Football Playoff years? The semifinals felt… brutal. Like, *really* brutal. One team would just steamroll the other, leaving a trail of broken dreams and lopsided scores in their wake. Blowouts were the norm, and you’d find yourself checking the clock halfway through the third quarter wondering when it would finally end.

I was thinking about that a lot this year (2024), watching the semifinal games unfold. And something felt… different. It wasn’t a seismic shift, mind you, but a subtle change that’s been creeping in over the last few seasons. The margins were tighter. The tension was higher. The nail-biting moments? Oh, they were *definitely* there.

Michigan’s win over Alabama wasn’t a runaway victory. It was a grind, a back-and-forth battle that came down to key plays and a whole lot of grit. And then there was Oregon and Texas – wow. That game alone offered everything you could want in a playoff semifinal: incredible athleticism, strategic chess matches, and a finish that had everyone on the edge of their seats until the very last play.

It got me wondering *why* this is happening. Is it simply regression to the mean? Maybe those early years were outliers, the result of truly dominant teams facing teams that hadn't quite caught up. Or has the parity in college football genuinely increased? With the transfer portal and the evolving landscape of NIL, are teams more evenly matched than ever before?

I'm leaning towards the latter. The ability for players to choose their programs, the increased resources available to a wider range of schools… it’s leveling the playing field. Coaching schemes are becoming more sophisticated, too. Everyone's studying everyone else, adapting, and finding ways to exploit weaknesses.

Ultimately, these tighter semifinal games are a *good* thing for the sport. They’re more exciting to watch, they showcase the incredible talent and coaching across the country, and they give us more reason to believe that *anyone* can make a run at the championship. Bring on the final!
