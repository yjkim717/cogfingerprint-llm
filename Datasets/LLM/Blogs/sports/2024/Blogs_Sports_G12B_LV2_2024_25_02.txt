>## Letting the Algorithm Guide My Feet

Okay, confession time. I've *always* resisted structured training plans. The idea of rigidly following a schedule felt…suffocating. Years of running were built on instinct, on just *feeling* it. But then, a half marathon popped up on my calendar for October 2024, and the "just feeling it" approach felt a little shaky.

Enter my Garmin. It started suggesting workouts – tempo runs, interval sessions – things I’d usually avoid. Initially, I scoffed. But curiosity won. And honestly? It’s been surprisingly… freeing.  There's a strange comfort in knowing the watch has crunched the numbers, considered my past performance, and is gently nudging me towards a goal pace. 

It's not about abandoning intuition entirely. It's about blending it with a little algorithmic guidance. Who knew trusting a computer could actually feel so...human?
