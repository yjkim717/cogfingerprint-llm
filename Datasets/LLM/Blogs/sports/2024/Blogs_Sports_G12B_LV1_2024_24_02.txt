## The Wedge Whisperer (and My Frustratingly Long Pitching Wedge)

Okay, so I'm officially admitting defeat. My pitching wedge is playing like a glorified 4-iron. Seriously! I’ve been working on my golf tempo all off-season – smooth takeaway, measured transition, solid follow-through – and yet, my PW is carrying almost the same distance as my 4-iron. It’s baffling.

I've been watching YouTube videos, obsessing over club face angles at impact (apparently, I’m catching it a *little* too square), and even tried adjusting my stance. Nothing seems to consistently fix it. 

It’s a humbling reminder that golf isn’t just about a 'good swing'. There’s so much nuance – the turf conditions, the wind, even how your grip feels that day. 2024 is shaping up to be a year of experimentation, and a lot of extra balls on the range! Wish me luck!
