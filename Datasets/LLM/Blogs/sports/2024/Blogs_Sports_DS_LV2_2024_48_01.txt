The final buzzer echoes as I untie my worn-out sneakers. Twenty years since my first game, and the court still feels like home. Funny how a simple bounce of a ball can shape a lifeâ€”teaching me about teamwork, resilience, and that sweet, fleeting taste of victory. Even now, in 2024, lacing up brings back every lesson learned and every friend made along the way.
