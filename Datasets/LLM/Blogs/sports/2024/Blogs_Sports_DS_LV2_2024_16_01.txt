### The Real Scoreboard

It’s Tuesday again. For me, that doesn’t just mean meetings and to-do lists. It means Trivia Tuesday for our little online college football community. The notification pops up, and for a few minutes, my world narrows to obscure stats, legendary plays, and the fierce, friendly battle for bragging rights.

The 2024 season has been a wild one, and seeing the new rankings this week—the teams jockeying in the Premier Tier, the hopefuls climbing in the Championship Tier—got me thinking. It’s funny how we get so caught up in these lists. We treat them like gospel, letting a team's position dictate our mood for the week.

But then I remembered last week’s trivia question. It was about a specific fourth-quarter comeback from 1998. I knew the answer. I *knew* it. But in my haste, I typed the wrong quarterback’s name. I submitted it and instantly felt that pang of regret. I could have just… left it. No one would have known. But I didn't. I sent a quick correction to the group admin, forfeiting the points.

And you know what? That felt like a bigger win than any top-tier ranking ever could.

These tiers and trivia scores are a fantastic, engaging game. They connect us, give us a shared language, and fuel our passion. But the real championship, I’m learning, isn't about being in the premier bracket on some list. It’s in the honest participation. It’s in the love for the game itself, the respect for its history, and the integrity to play fair, even when no one is watching. That’s a victory that doesn’t need a trophy.
