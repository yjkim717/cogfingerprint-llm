**Is My Garmin Telling Me Lies? The Half Marathon Puzzle**

I’m staring at my Garmin, a little frustrated. I’ve got a half marathon goal – a specific pace I desperately want to hit – and the coach training plan keeps spitting out workouts that feel…off. It’s making me question whether blindly following the daily suggestions is *actually* helping me get there. 

Maybe I’m overthinking it.  I’ve started experimenting, layering in some of my own longer runs and speed work, guided by a few trusted coaches. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best training isn’t about following a rigid plan, but about listening to your body and trusting your instincts.  What are your thoughts on personalized training?
