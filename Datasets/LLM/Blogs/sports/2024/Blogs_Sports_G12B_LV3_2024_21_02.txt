## The Week 12 Shift: Is Oregon Finally Taking Flight?

College football in 2024 is proving to be delightfully unpredictable, isn’t it? Just glancing at the /r/CFB poll for Week 12 really highlights that. Seeing Oregon Ducks perched at the very top feels…right, somehow. They’ve been building towards this, a quiet confidence simmering beneath the surface. 

Ohio State remains a formidable force, of course, but the real story for me is Indiana’s impressive surge into the top three! It’s a reminder that in college football, anything can happen. It’s that element of surprise, that potential for the underdog to rise, that keeps us all coming back for more, week after week. What a season it's shaping up to be!
