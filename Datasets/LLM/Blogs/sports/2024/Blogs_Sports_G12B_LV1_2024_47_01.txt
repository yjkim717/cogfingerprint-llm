>## The Art of the Standstill: Dealing with a Physical Post Game

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with something on the court lately. We’re facing some teams with *seriously* physical post players. The kind who aren’t just trying to score, they're trying to intimidate. They lean, they shove, they’re constantly testing your balance, all designed to wear you down and back you into the paint. 

It's frustrating, right? You feel like you're fighting for every inch. Early in the season, I was getting pushed around, losing position, and honestly, getting a little rattled. My coach kept saying, "Leverage, son. It's all about leverage." 

He wasn’t talking about brute strength – though that helps – but about using your body, your feet, and your angles to your advantage. A little shoulder drop, keeping low, and using their momentum against them. It’s like a chess match, really. 

I've been practicing a lot of footwork drills and working on maintaining my center of gravity. It’s amazing how much of a difference a solid base makes. It’s not about *fighting* them, it’s about *out-positioning* them. Sometimes, the best offense is a well-timed stalemate. And hey, a little strategic arm-bar here and there isn't hurting either!
