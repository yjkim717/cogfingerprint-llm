As I stepped off the field after our intense 2024 math-a-thon competition, I felt a strange sensation - goosebumps. It wasn't just the thrill of winning that gave me chills, but a sudden realization that our team's brain power was dwindling. We joked it was supernatural, but the truth was, we were all consumed by the pressure. It reminded me of a book I read as a kid about two students losing their math skills due to mysterious forces - I still can't identify the title!
