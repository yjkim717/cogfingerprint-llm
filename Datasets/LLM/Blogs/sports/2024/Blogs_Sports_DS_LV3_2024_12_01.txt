There’s this chess mini-game I’ve been stuck on for days—2024’s latest digital puzzle craze. My strategy seemed solid: push the pawn, promote to a queen, and capture that pesky knight. But every time I get close, the knight dances away, guarding key squares with infuriating precision. It’s like chasing a shadow.

I’ve reset the board more times than I care to admit, each move a lesson in patience and foresight. In chess, as in life, the simplest plans often meet the toughest resistance. Maybe the real win isn’t capturing the piece but learning to outthink the obstacle. Still, tonight, that knight is going down.
