October’s golden light over Italy—I can already picture it. But my 2024 trip isn’t just about pasta and piazzas; it’s about hearing a stadium roar. I’m refreshing my phone daily, waiting for that Serie A schedule to drop. Which clubs will be fighting for glory, and which are facing the heartbreak of relegation? I just want to be there, in the stands, feeling that collective pulse. It’s more than a game; it’s a memory I’m waiting to live. The countdown is on.
