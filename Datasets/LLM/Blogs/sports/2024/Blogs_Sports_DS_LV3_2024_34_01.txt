It’s 2024, and as I watch another college football Saturday unfold, I can’t help but marvel at those rare, almost mythical performances: the “Perfect Game.” Since 2007, there have only been 34 of them in the FBS. Think about that—a team scoring a touchdown on every single offensive drive, no let-up until garbage time. It’s the absolute peak of offensive execution, a symphony of play-calling, skill, and sheer will.

In a sport defined by chaos and unpredictability, these games are a beautiful anomaly. They remind us that perfection, however fleeting, is possible. It’s not just about the stats; it’s about a team operating in flawless harmony, a moment where everything just… clicks. And for those of us watching, it’s pure magic.
