**The Thrill of the Guess – Why College Football Trivia Still Matters**

It’s funny how something as simple as a weekly trivia contest can spark so much excitement. I’ve been spending a lot of time on r/CFB lately, and this college football trivia challenge on Reddit is genuinely addictive. It’s more than just testing your knowledge; it feels like a little bit of community, a shared obsession with the sport.
