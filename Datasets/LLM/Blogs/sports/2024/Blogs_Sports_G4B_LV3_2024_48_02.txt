**The Weight of the Headphones, the Weight of the Game**

There’s something about the feeling of slipping on a good pair of headphones before a big game – a little ritual, a tiny shield against the noise. I’ve been wrestling with my audio setup lately, and it unexpectedly led me back to a memory of my high school days. I was obsessed with my Grado SR80x, blasting ambient tracks to zone in. 

But last year, they started to feel…heavy. Not just physically, but mentally. The open-back design, which I’d loved for the airy sound, became uncomfortable during long practices. It was a frustrating reminder that even the best gear can’t fix everything, especially when it impacts your focus. Now, I’m searching for something new – something with a USB-C adapter, of course, it’s 2024! 

It’s funny how these little things, like the comfort of your headphones, can mirror the pressures of performance. Sometimes, you just need a fresh start.
