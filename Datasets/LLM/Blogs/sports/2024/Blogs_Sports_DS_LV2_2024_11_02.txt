Looking back at the 2024 NBA Finals, I can’t help but wonder: if the losing team’s coach knew then what we all know now, would he have called that fateful timeout? Hindsight is a brutal referee.

We fans dissect every play, every decision, but in that moment, it’s just a gut call under the brightest lights. It’s a reminder that in sports, as in life, we make the best choice we can with the information we have, even if the final buzzer tells a different story.
