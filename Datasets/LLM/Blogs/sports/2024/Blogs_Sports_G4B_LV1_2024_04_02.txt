**The Portal Blues**

Okay, 2024 dynasty league friends, let’s talk about a frustrating reality: the transfer portal. I dove in headfirst, convinced it was a goldmine for building my team, especially at tight end and wide receiver. I had open scholarships, seemingly endless opportunities...and nothing. It felt like everyone was already locked in, chasing the “elite players” everyone was talking about. 

It was a harsh lesson – the portal isn't always the quick fix you hope for. Sometimes, building a strong foundation through scouting and patience is the real key to dynasty success.  Anyone else feel this sting this year?
