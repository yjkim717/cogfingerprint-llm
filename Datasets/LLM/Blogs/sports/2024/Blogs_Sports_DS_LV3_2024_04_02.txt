It’s 2024, and I thought I had this dynasty-building thing down. My program’s facilities are top-tier, our culture is solid—we should be a magnet for the transfer portal. But there’s this bizarre glitch. I’m offering scholarships to perfect-fit players, and they just… ghost me. No explanation, no logic. It’s like hitting an invisible wall in recruiting. You pour your heart into building a contender, only to be locked out by some digital mystery. It’s more than frustrating; it makes the whole grind feel strangely personal.
