As I watched my 10-year-old son tear through the latest Fortnite updates on his Xbox, I couldn't help but think back to my own childhood. I spent hours playing NBA Jam on my old Sega Genesis, laughing with friends and family as we competed in tournaments that seemed to last forever. Now, as a parent, I'm faced with a new decision: should I upgrade his console to an Xbox Series S or X this Christmas? With Black Friday deals looming, the temptation is strong. The Series X promises next-gen graphics and performance, but is it worth the extra cost? Meanwhile, the Series S offers a more affordable entry point into the world of next-gen gaming. As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that it's not just about the console â€“ it's about the memories we'll create together. Will I opt for the future or balance quality with budget?
