**The Ghosts of Perfect Drives: What Makes an Offense *Really* Special?**

Okay, football nerds, let’s talk about something rare – the “perfect game.” I’ve been diving into some fascinating data lately, looking at 34 FBS games since 2007 that essentially *dominated* – scoring on every offensive drive. It’s a captivating concept, right? But it got me thinking: are these truly masterpieces, or are they just…lucky?

What really struck me was the obsession with metrics. Points per drive, yards per play – it’s all crucial, of course. But a perfect game isn't just about racking up points; it’s about *how* you’re doing it.  You can have a team churning out 10 yards on every play, but if they’re consistently stalled a few yards short of the first down, it’s not a perfect equation.

It’s like a really well-oiled machine – smooth, efficient, and relentlessly moving forward.  These ‘perfect’ games highlighted teams that weren’t just scoring, they were *controlling* the game. 

It’s a reminder that football, at its best, is a complex dance of execution and opportunity.  And while a single, flawless drive is impressive, it's the consistent, dominant offensive flow that truly defines a team's greatness.  What do you think?  Can you recall a game that felt *really* unstoppable?
