It’s 2024, and down at Texas College, there’s a quiet rebuild happening that won’t make the national headlines. I was talking with Coach Jarrail Jackson the other day, and he didn’t mention wins or losses once. His challenge is different. It’s about getting his Steers certified, eligible, and believing they belong on the same field as anyone else in the NAIA.

That’s the real work, isn’t it? The stuff that happens far from the bright lights. It’s in the paperwork, the academic check-ins, and convincing a young man who’s been overlooked that he has a future here. The scoreboard will tell one story on Saturdays, but the true measure of this program is being written today in those small, persistent acts of building something from the ground up. It’s a humbling reminder that the most important victories often happen long before the game even starts.
