It’s hard to ignore the electric energy of the 2024 Olympics Trials! I’ve been glued to the schedule, particularly excited about Day 8. There’s something incredibly motivating about watching athletes push themselves to their absolute limits, chasing a spot on that world stage.  

Tonight, it’s all about the Men’s 110m Hurdles Final – a brutal race demanding both explosive speed and pinpoint precision.  I find myself thinking about the dedication it takes to reach trials, the countless hours of training, and the sheer nerve it takes to compete. It’s a reminder that striving for something big is always worth the effort.
