**The Dual Threat: Watching Travis Hunter This Year**

Seriously, 2024 is shaping up to be wild. I’ve been glued to the screen watching Travis Hunter, and those PFF grades are *insane*. An 88.3 as a receiver AND a 90.9 as a cornerback? It’s a level of versatility we rarely see. 

It’s not just the numbers, though. It’s the way he reads plays, the instinctive coverage – you can tell he’s impacting the game everywhere.  He’s a constant reminder that sometimes, the most exciting players are the ones who defy expectations and rewrite the playbook. What a season so far!
