**The Uncomfortable Silence of the Game**

You know that feeling? Like you’re *right* there, watching your team, and then… nothing. Just a sudden, unsettling silence. It happened to me last weekend at the college football game – our kicker missed a crucial field goal. The stadium held its breath, and for a split second, I felt a similar blockage, a frustrating pause in the flow of the game. Reminded me of trying to get a stubborn burner working on the grill – you gotta dig in and find the root cause. Sometimes, it’s about more than just fixing a problem; it’s about pushing through the quiet and getting back to the action.
