**Chasing the Sun: Why I’m Dreaming of Aruba (and a Little Relaxation)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? After a year of pushing myself with intense training, I’m suddenly craving… nothing. Seriously. I’m picturing myself on a beach – white sand, turquoise water – like in Aruba or Curacao.  That feeling of complete relaxation, just letting the waves wash over you… it’s a powerful reset. 

Sports are amazing for discipline, but sometimes, you just need to trade the competition for sunshine and a good book.  This year, I’m realizing the importance of balance.  A little beach time feels less like a reward and more like a vital part of staying motivated and grounded.
