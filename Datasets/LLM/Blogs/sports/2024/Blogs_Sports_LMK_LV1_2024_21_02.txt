The 2024 college football season is shaping up to be one for the books, and the latest /r/CFB Poll results for Week 12 are a testament to that. As I scrolled through the rankings, one thing stood out - the Oregon Ducks are on top of the world, holding down the number one spot in the top 5. It's a remarkable achievement, and one that I didn't see coming when the season tipped off.

The Ducks have been on a tear all season, racking up win after win and impressing fans and pundits alike with their high-powered offense. And it's not just Oregon that's making waves - the Ohio State Buckeyes are still lurking in the top 5, looking to make a deep playoff run of their own.

As a college football fan, it's thrilling to see two powerhouses like Oregon and Ohio State going head-to-head in the rankings. The Buckeyes have been a force to be reckoned with for years, and it's exciting to see them getting pushed by a talented Ducks squad.

Of course, there are still several weeks left in the season, and anything can happen. Will Oregon continue to hold on to the top spot, or will Ohio State (or another dark horse) come storming through? One thing's for sure - I'm glued to my TV for the rest of the season to find out. The 2024 college football season is sure to be one for the ages, and I'm honored to be along for the ride.
