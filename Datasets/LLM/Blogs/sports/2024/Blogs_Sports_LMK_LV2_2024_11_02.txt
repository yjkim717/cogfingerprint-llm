As I watched the 2024 Olympics, I couldn't help but think about the athletes who came up short. Just like the 'Friends' fans who still wonder what could've been if Joey and Rachel were a couple, I ponder the what-ifs for athletes who narrowly missed the podium. In hindsight, what decisions led to their outcome? Do they regret their training regimens? Their stories are a reminder that sometimes, it's not about winning, but about the journey.
