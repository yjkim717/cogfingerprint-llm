Okay, so 2024 is already feeling intense, right? Lately, I’ve been obsessed with finding those little bursts of flavor – like a sudden, bright *lemon maraschino* after a tough run. I’ve been diving into some vape reviews for Strane Reserve, specifically the *Fruit Gushers* and some *mint strains* – trying to recapture that feeling of pure energy. It’s weird, but it’s helping me push through those late-night training sessions.  Maybe it’s just a placebo, but hey, a little flavor motivation never hurt!
