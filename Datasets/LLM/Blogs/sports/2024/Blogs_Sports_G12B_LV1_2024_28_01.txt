## The Agony and the Assist: My Little League Coaching Journey

Okay, deep breath. Let me tell you about the last few weeks. It’s been… a learning experience. I volunteered to coach my son’s Little League team this year – the "Raptors," a name we collectively brainstormed, mostly involving pizza and questionable superhero preferences. I thought it would be fun, wholesome, a chance to bond with my kid and a bunch of energetic eight-year-olds. And it *is*, mostly.

But then came the batting slump. Little Leo, my son, and a few others just… stopped hitting. Confidence plummeted. Practices devolved into a cycle of frustration, forced encouragement, and me feeling increasingly clueless. I tried everything I could remember from watching baseball games – reminding them to keep their eye on the ball, adjusting their stance, even attempting a motivational speech that probably just confused them. Nothing worked. It was like chasing a glitch in a video game, going around and around the same problem.

I felt helpless, and honestly, a bit ridiculous. Then, I swallowed my pride and reached out to a more experienced coach in the league, a retired high school player named Mr. Henderson. He watched a practice, asked a few pointed questions, and in about five minutes, identified the issue – a minor alignment problem impacting their swing. A tiny adjustment, a little coaching, and *bam*. Suddenly, the bats were connecting.

It was a humbling reminder that sometimes, you need an expert, someone outside your own limited perspective, to break the loop. Just like that Apple support story I read the other day, sometimes the solution isn’t about brute force, but about knowing when to ask for help. And, more importantly, seeing the joy on Leo's face when he finally cracked that ball? Totally worth the initial frustration.
