## That Feeling When the Momentum Just… Crushes You

Anyone else ever feel like you're playing a different game than everyone else? I had one of those moments last weekend during a pickup basketball game. We were down by ten, scrappy, but fighting. Then, *bam*. One lucky three, a steal, another three, and suddenly the other team was up twenty, and the energy completely shifted.

It wasn’t just about the points. It was that feeling where every shot seemed to fall for them, every pass connected, and our attempts just… clanked. It felt like the universe was actively rooting against us.

It reminded me of those frustrating moments in games like *Destiny*, where a team gets an early advantage and it feels almost impossible to pull back, like a runaway snowball. A few lucky spawns, a couple of key plays, and the whole match just spirals.

Is it skill? Sure, partly. But sometimes, it feels like an unfair chain reaction. Like, a tiny advantage gets amplified into an insurmountable lead. 

I’m not saying winning isn't deserving, but those games where the momentum just *crushes* you? They leave a bitter taste, don’t they? It’s a reminder that sometimes, luck plays a bigger role than we'd like to admit. Anyone else relate? Let me know in the comments!
