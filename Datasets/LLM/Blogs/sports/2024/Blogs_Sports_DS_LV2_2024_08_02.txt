As a lifelong Michigan fan, I’ve learned to expect the unexpected—but those overtime bowl wins still leave me breathless. Beating Alabama twice in extra time? In the BCS era and now the CFP? It’s more than luck; it’s heart. In 2024, as we chase new glory, I hold onto those moments. They remind me why I love this game: it’s not just about championships, but the unforgettable, nail-biting finishes that bond us forever. Go Blue.
