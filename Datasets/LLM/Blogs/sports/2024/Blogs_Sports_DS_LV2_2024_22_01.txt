The roar of the crowd used to be my fuel. In 2024, watching my sonâ€™s first T-ball game, I finally understood my dad. He never cared about the final score during my own chaotic little league years; he was just watching *me*. The pure joy on his face wasn't about winning, but about being present for the journey. That silent, steadfast support was the real victory, a lesson that took me decades to truly hear.
