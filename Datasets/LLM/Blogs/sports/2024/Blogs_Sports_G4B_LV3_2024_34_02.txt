**The Numbers Don’t Tell the Whole Story, Do They?**

It’s hard to ignore the data in college football, isn’t it? This year, I’ve been completely absorbed in tracking the Massey Composite – that fascinating ranking system that tries to account for strength of schedule – alongside the AP Poll. Seeing the table detailing how teams like those ranked in the AP Top 25 fared against their opponents through Week 14 was… intense. 

Honestly, it’s easy to get caught up in the wins and losses, the rankings climbing and falling. But what really struck me was the *who* behind those victories. Were those wins against teams with similarly high opponent rankings? Or were they hard-fought battles against unranked squads? 

That’s where the Massey Composite shines. It’s a reminder that a single win doesn’t equal a truly impressive performance.  It’s about the quality of the competition, and that’s a far more nuanced and rewarding way to appreciate the season’s unfolding drama.
