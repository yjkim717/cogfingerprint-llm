"Competing in Destiny 2's crucible has never been more frustrating. The special ammo crate system is broken, and it's time someone said it out loud. As a competitive player myself, I've experienced firsthand how this mechanic can snowball a match in favor of one team. The issue isn't just that the crates spawn randomly - it's that they often spawn in areas that are already contested, or worse, right on top of a cluster of players. This creates an unfair advantage, where one team can suddenly gain access to powerful special ammo and dominate the opposing team. I've lost count of how many matches have been decided by a lucky crate spawn. It's 2024, and we're still dealing with this issue. Bungie needs to take a hard look at the competitive gameplay mechanics and make some serious changes to level the playing field."
