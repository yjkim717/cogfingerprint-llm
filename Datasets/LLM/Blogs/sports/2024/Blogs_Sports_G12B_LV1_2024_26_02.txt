>## The Poku Puzzle: Thunder Fans Hold Their Breath

Okay, Thunder fans, let's be honest. The off-season feels… different this year. It's not just the usual draft excitement; there's a quiet tension humming around Jaden Poku's restricted free agency. Seeing him blossom into such a crucial piece of this team has been incredible, and the thought of him potentially leaving… well, it’s a gut punch.

The rumors of offer sheets from other teams are swirling, and while we're optimistic OKC will match, you can’t help but wonder. Will Poku sign a long-term extension? Does he see his future here, alongside SGA and Chet? It’s a delicate dance. 

Ultimately, it’s a testament to what we've built. We're a desirable destination now, and that means facing these tough decisions. Here's hoping the Thunder can keep this rising star locked down and continue building towards that championship window. Fingers crossed!
