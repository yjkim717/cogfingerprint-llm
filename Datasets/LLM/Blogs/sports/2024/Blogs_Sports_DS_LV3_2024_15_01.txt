The familiar buzz of the stadium was different tonight. It was 2024, and my team’s highly anticipated season opener was scheduled for a 7:10 PM kickoff. I’d built my whole evening around that sacred start time, arriving early to soak in the pre-game pageantry—the player introductions, the hype video, the national anthem.

But the giant screen flickered, and suddenly the teams were lining up. It was 6:55 PM. The usual fifteen-minute spectacle of trailers for upcoming matchups and sponsor ads had been cut to a mere five. That small, unexpected shift threw me off. My ritual was disrupted. I felt a pang of disorientation before the first whistle even blew, a reminder of how deeply we cling to the rhythms of our game-day routines and how the slightest change can make the familiar feel strangely new.
