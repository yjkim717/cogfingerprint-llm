## The Quiet Backbone of Cyclones Football

Something about offensive lines just gets to me. They're the unsung heroes, aren't they? Watching Iowa State this year, it’s clear – their success truly rides on those big guys up front. We all cheer for the flashy plays, the touchdowns, but without a solid offensive line, those moments just don’t happen. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the quietest work builds the biggest victories. Hoping to see those Cyclones linemen pave the way to a Big 12 run in 2024!
