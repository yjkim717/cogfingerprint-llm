There’s something timeless about hearing a fight song swell as the clock winds down. In 2024, with so much change in college sports, those traditions feel more precious than ever. I still get chills remembering the pure joy when Iowa State’s band struck up after a huge upset. It’s more than a song—it’s a shared heartbeat with 60,000 strangers, a moment of unity that no conference realignment can ever take away. That’s the real power of game day.
