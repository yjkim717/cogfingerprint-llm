**The Phantom Delay**

You know those moments in a game where everything just…stutters? Last weekend, watching the championship soccer match, we hit one of those. A massive delay – nearly fifteen minutes – before the second half even started. It sparked this weird feeling, a collective unease. Was it technical? A scheduling snafu? It completely shifted the energy, making the game feel less about the competition and more about the *experience* of waiting. It’s funny how a little delay can completely alter your perception of something you’re anticipating so intensely.
