**The Uncomfortable Feeling of a Loss You Can’t Quite Shake**

There’s a weird thing about losing a game, right? You might celebrate the win, high-five your teammates, and feel that rush of adrenaline. But sometimes, even after the confetti settles, you’re left with this… lingering feeling. 

I had that recently watching my local high school football team. They fought hard, lost a close one – a judgment, if you will – and honestly, I kept thinking about the fumble in the fourth quarter. It wasn’t about blaming anyone; it was about that specific moment, that possession of a critical play that shifted everything. 

It made me think about how sometimes, even with a court order (a legal writ, basically!), you can’t *make* things go back to how they were. You can't get a summary judgment to erase the memory.  It’s about accepting the outcome, learning from it, and moving forward.  Anyone else feel this way after a tough loss?
