That final buzzer in 2024 still echoes. We didn't get the trophy, but we got something more—a team that became a family. It’s funny; you train for the perfect play, but you remember the imperfect moments: a teammate’s quiet encouragement, a shared laugh after a fumble. That’s the real victory. It wasn’t about the scoreboard; it was about who we became on that journey together. And honestly, I wouldn’t trade that for any championship.
