**Is Slafkovsky Being Judged Too Hard?**

You know, as we’re halfway through the 2024 season, it’s easy to get caught up in the noise. Every game is dissected, every stat scrutinized. And right now, there’s a lot of talk about Shane Slafkovsky. He’s getting hammered for his production, and honestly, it feels a little… unfair.

I’ve been watching him play, and he’s showing flashes of something really special. He’s been working on his forecheck, getting into better positions, and he clearly has incredible chemistry with his line mates. It’s like he's still figuring out his role.

He's a power forward, and that requires a different kind of impact – disrupting the opponent, winning battles, and setting up the scoring chances. Let’s give him the space to develop and build, and trust that the results will come.
