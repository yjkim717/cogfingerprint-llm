The wail cuts through the house, and I watch my four-year-old son, Leo, transform. His hands fly to his ears, his body tenses, and the world shrinks to that one overwhelming sound—his baby brother’s cry. We’ve tried noise-canceling headphones, deep pressure hugs, a calm-down corner, but when the sensory storm hits, it often ends with him hitting out. It’s a heartbreaking puzzle: his distress is real, his aggression is a symptom, not the cause. We’re not just managing behavior; we’re trying to help him survive the avalanche of his own senses, all while keeping his little brother safe. The search for the right coping strategy continues, one difficult moment at a time.

Remember when elite athletes were almost mythical? In 2024, they feel more relatable than ever. I was watching a tennis match where a young star, after a crushing loss, did a raw, emotional post-game interview. No corporate platitudes. Just honest talk about pressure and the struggle to find joy in the game. It hit me: modern sports aren't just about the highlight reel. They're about the humanity—the public navigating of mental health, pressure, and passion. And honestly, it’s a more compelling story than any perfect victory.
