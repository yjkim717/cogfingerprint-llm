My wife’s basketball knowledge begins and ends with our home team—or so I thought. Last night, scrolling through NBA highlights from the 2024 playoffs, I pointed to a star from a conference rival. “Who’s that?” I asked, expecting a blank stare. She squinted, then grinned. “That’s his face? I only know him from Instagram with his significant other!” It hit me: fame now transcends the court, built as much on social media as on slam dunks. Maybe I’m the one still catching up.
