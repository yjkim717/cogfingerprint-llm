Remember those College Football Playoff semifinals from a few years back? The ones where you’d settle in with snacks, only to find the game was essentially over by halftime? For a while, it felt like “semifinal” was just a polite term for “inevitable blowout.” The drama was often missing, replaced by a predictable, lopsided march to the championship.

But something has shifted. Looking back at the last four nail-biters, culminating in the heart-stopping finishes of the 2024 season, it’s clear we’re in a new golden age of postseason drama. The victory margins have shrunk from chasms to mere inches. Games are now decided on the final play—a Hail Mary in the end zone, a goal-line stand as the clock hits zero.

This isn’t just better football; it feels more human. We’re no longer just spectators to a foregone conclusion. We’re holding our breath with millions of others, sharing that collective, edge-of-your-seat anxiety. The shift from predictable blowouts to these breathtakingly close games has given us back the raw, emotional payoff that makes sports so compelling. It’s a welcome reminder that on any given Saturday, anything can happen—and lately, it absolutely has.
