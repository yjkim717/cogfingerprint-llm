It’s 2024, and I’m 37, tipping the scales at 16st 2lb. MyFitnessPal’s subscription push felt like a penalty, so I switched to free UK apps like Calorie Counter + and MyNetDiary. Tracking every bite isn’t just about numbers—it’s my new sport. Each logged meal is a small victory, a step toward reclaiming my health. It’s a personal marathon, and I’m finally in the race, one mindful choice at a time.
