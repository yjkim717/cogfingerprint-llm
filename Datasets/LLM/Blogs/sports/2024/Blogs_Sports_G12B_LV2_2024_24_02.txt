## That Wedge Feeling (And Why It's Not Always What You Think)

Anyone else ever feel like their wedges are just… confused? I was out on the course last week, and I swear my pitching wedge was behaving like a 7-iron. Same distance, similar flight. Frustrating, right? 

It got me thinking about how we *think* we know our swing. We feel like we're hitting a soft flop shot, but the ball rockets off the clubface. It’s a reminder that golf is less about *feeling* great and more about *seeing* the results. 

I’m scheduling a session with a swing coach to really dig into my tempo and club delivery. Maybe it's a subtle shift I'm missing. Anyone else battling similar wedge woes? Let’s commiserate (and hopefully find some solutions!) in the comments.
