There’s a moment in the post now—2024, and I’m still thinking about that defender last night. He wasn’t just big; he was clever. Every time I tried to back him down, his knee was already there, an immovable anchor. An arm bar would lock me in place, turning my spin move into a wrestling match. I couldn’t leverage my strength at all.

It’s frustrating, but it’s the game within the game. Do you stand your ground, risk the fouls, and fight through it? Or do you adjust, find a new angle, and outsmart the pressure? I used to see it as a battle of wills. Now, I see it as a lesson—sometimes, the most aggressive challenges teach you not to push harder, but to think differently. And that’s a win, foul or not.
