As I stepped onto the soccer field in 2024, the string lights hung from the pergola above, casting a warm glow. I couldn't help but think of my friend's DIY dilemma - how to hang lights without damaging the gutter system. Just like a well-executed game plan, he used adhesive 3M strips and Feit LED lights to secure them. It was a winning strategy, and the ambiance was electric. The team played with a newfound energy, and we won the game under the twinkling lights.
