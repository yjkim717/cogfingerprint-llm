## The Silent Start and the Sunday Game

There’s something deeply frustrating about a machine that refuses to cooperate, isn’t there? This weekend, my Ranch King riding mower – a trusty, if slightly older, MTD – decided it wasn't feeling a lawn-trimming mood. Battery was good, ignition switch working fine, but absolutely no crank. It felt a bit like watching your favorite team struggle in the first quarter. 

You're there, ready to cheer them on, but they just…stall. 

Turns out, it was a solenoid issue, probably a dodgy wire. A small fix, but it reminded me of those nail-biting moments in sports where a single play can change everything. Sometimes, it’s the little things, the seemingly insignificant parts, that hold back the whole operation. Hoping my team finds their spark this season, just like I found mine with that mower!
