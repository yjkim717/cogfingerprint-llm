As I reflect on the sports tech landscape in 2024, I'm struck by the disparity between Apple's Siri and Google Assistant. Just like a clumsy quarterback, Siri fumbles through conversations with its robotic tone and lackluster responses. In contrast, Google Assistant is like a seasoned coach, providing insightful analysis and personalized guidance. Whether you're tracking your fitness goals or seeking sports news, Google Assistant is the clear MVP. Its AI-powered intuition makes it an indispensable companion for athletes and enthusiasts alike, leaving Siri in the dust.
