**The Weight of a Great Player’s Choice**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching a legend like Karl-Anthony Towns with the Timberwolves – a franchise built around his talent – and wondering if this is it? Seeing those incredible numbers, the way he carries the team… it makes you think about the pressure, the constant grind.
