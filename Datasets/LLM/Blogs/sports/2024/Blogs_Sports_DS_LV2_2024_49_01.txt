It’s 2024, and I’m still chasing that elusive big break—not in real life, but in the virtual dugout of *Football Manager*. For the past three seasons, I’ve poured my heart into a tiny lower-league club, turning them from relegation fodder into promotion contenders. We’ve overachieved, balanced the books, and built a squad with more spirit than talent.

But here’s the thing: no one’s noticed. In the real world, a manager pulling off miracles like that would be headhunted by ambitious Championship clubs in a heartbeat. Yet in the game? Radio silence. My inbox stays empty, my reputation barely flickers.

It’s funny, really. I started playing to escape the grind, but now I’m stuck in a digital version of the same story—overlooked and underrated. Maybe that’s the game’s most realistic feature: sometimes, no matter how well you do, the call never comes. And isn’t that just life?
