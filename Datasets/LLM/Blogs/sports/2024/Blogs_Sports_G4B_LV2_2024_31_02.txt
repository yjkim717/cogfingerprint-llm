**The Carrot and the Call â€“ A Taskmaster Moment**

Anyone else get completely stuck on a sports moment and replay it endlessly? Last week, watching *Taskmaster* had me obsessing over Babaâ€™s run during the double points challenge. Seriously, should he have gotten a penalty? It felt like a tiny, frustrating injustice.
