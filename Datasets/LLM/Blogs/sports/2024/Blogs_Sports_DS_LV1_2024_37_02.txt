It’s 2024, and I’m still puzzling over those recruiting hours in the old NCAA Football games. Was it really tied to how well my team performed the year before? If so, that’s brilliant game design—rewarding success with more tools to build for the future. It makes me wonder if real-life programs feel that same pressure to perform, not just for glory, but for the resources to keep competing.
