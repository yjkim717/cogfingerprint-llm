There’s something special about Tuesdays for college football fans like me. It’s not game day—no roaring stadiums or nail-biting finishes—but it’s the day we get to test our passion in a different way: Trivia Tuesday. Every week, I find myself scrolling through questions, feeling that familiar mix of confidence and humility. Some answers come instantly, pulled from years of watching games and following stats. Others? Well, let’s just say they remind me there’s always more to learn.

This season, the buzz around the Premier and Championship Tiers has been impossible to ignore. Seeing Michigan hold strong at the top of the Premier Tier feels like watching a well-oiled machine in motion—there’s a sense of legacy and consistency there. And then there’s UMass, leading the Championship Tier. It’s the kind of underdog story that makes college football so compelling. It’s not just about the big names; it’s about heart, grit, and those moments that redefine a program.

In 2024, as the landscape of CFB continues to evolve, these weekly trivia challenges ground me. They’re a reminder of why I fell in love with the sport in the first place: the stories, the rivalries, the sheer unpredictability. Whether I’m debating with friends over a missed question or quietly celebrating a correct one, Trivia Tuesday connects me to a community that spans far beyond my living room.

So here’s to Tuesdays—to the stats, the surprises, and the shared love of the game. Because in the end, it’s not just about who’s on top; it’s about being part of something bigger, one question at a time.
