It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking a lot about the little challenges we set for ourselves—not for glory, but just to see what we’re capable of. Lately, I’ve been borrowing an idea from the gaming world, where players impose “conducts” or restrictions to make things interesting. In my case, it’s my weekly pickup basketball game.

I decided on a “no-dribble” challenge: catch, pivot, pass, and shoot—but no dribbling at all. At first, my teammates thought I’d lost it. We fumbled, laughed, and lost possession more times than I’d like to admit. But something shifted. We started moving smarter, communicating without words, finding angles we’d never noticed before.

By the third week, we weren’t just playing; we were solving the court like a puzzle. We didn’t always win, but the satisfaction of pulling off a smooth, dribble-free play felt like its own victory. It reminded me that sometimes, stepping back from the usual moves opens up a whole new way to play—and connect.
