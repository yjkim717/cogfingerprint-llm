## Remember That One Game?

It's funny how certain moments stick with you, isn't it? I was chatting with a friend the other day about a completely random basketball game from, oh, maybe 2016? We got *so* wrapped up in reliving the underdog victory, the surprising plays, the electric atmosphere. It's not about the stats now; it’s that feeling, that shared memory. Sports have a way of doing that, don’t they? Capturing a little piece of time and nostalgia.
