"As we navigated the 2024 season, our team's man-to-man defense was put to the test against the trendy 5-out offense. We struggled to adapt, and it cost us. Our big man was often left isolated on the perimeter, vulnerable to 3-pointers. Meanwhile, our rim protection suffered as we hesitated to switch and help. It was a frustrating cycle. We learned a valuable lesson: to succeed against modern offenses, we need to be more agile and communicative on defense. It's a challenge we're committed to overcoming as we head into the offseason."
