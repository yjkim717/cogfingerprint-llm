**The Shai Question**

It’s weird how quickly things shift in the NBA, isn’t it? I’ve been watching Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with the Thunder, and this whole restricted free agency situation has got me thinking. It feels like a crossroads. He’s a star, undeniably, but is Oklahoma City the *right* place for him to build his legacy? 

The whispers about offer sheets and future plans – it’s a reminder that even the most exciting seasons can have a quiet undercurrent of uncertainty. Makes you appreciate every game, every shot, every moment, doesn't it? #NBA #ShaiGilgeousAlexander #Thunder
