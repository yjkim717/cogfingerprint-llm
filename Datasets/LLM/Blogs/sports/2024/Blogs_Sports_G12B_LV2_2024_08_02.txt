## The Magic of Overtime: Remembering Michigan's Clutch Moments

It's funny how certain moments stick with you, isn't it? As a Michigan fan in 2024, I find myself often thinking back to those heart-stopping overtime games. Specifically, the battles against Alabama and Virginia Tech â€“ those BCS and CFP clashes felt monumental.

There's just something uniquely thrilling about the tension, the sudden shift in stakes, the sheer will it takes to pull out a win in overtime.  Rewatching highlights, I'm reminded of the collective breath held, the eruption of joy (or the crushing disappointment!). Those games weren't just wins; they were defining moments that shaped our fandom. Anyone else feel that way? What's *your* favorite unforgettable overtime moment?
