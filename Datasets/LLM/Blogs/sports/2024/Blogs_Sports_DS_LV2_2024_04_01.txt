You know, it’s funny how narratives take on a life of their own in sports. I was thinking about Charles Barkley’s recent jab that the Lakers only got a shot because of the play-in tournament. It got me reflecting on my own life—how often people dismiss our successes as just "lucky breaks."

But here’s the thing: the data doesn’t lie. The Lakers earned their spot, play-in or not, just like we earn our moments through persistence. Watching them battle into the Western Conference Finals in 2024 felt personal. It wasn’t about shortcuts; it was about seizing the opportunity when it mattered.

It reminds me that in the NBA playoffs—and in life—it’s not how you get there, but what you do with the chance. Maybe we should all be a little quicker to celebrate the fight, not just the path.
