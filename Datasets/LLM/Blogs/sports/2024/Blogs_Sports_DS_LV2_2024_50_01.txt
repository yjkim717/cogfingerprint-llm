The final buzzer echoed, and I just stood there, breathless. My team had lost the championship by a single point—a shot I’d missed. For weeks, that miss replayed in my mind, a ghost haunting every practice. But 2024 taught me that sports aren’t about the one shot you miss; they’re about the thousands you take to get there. The real victory was in the journey with my teammates, the grit we built, and learning that sometimes, falling short is what makes you stronger.
