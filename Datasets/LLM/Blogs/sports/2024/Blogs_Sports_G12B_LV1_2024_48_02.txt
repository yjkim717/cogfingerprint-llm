## The Unexpected Joy of Slow Miles

Okay, so 2024 started with a bang – a New Year’s resolution to *really* commit to running. I envisioned myself effortlessly clocking up miles, feeling like a lean, mean, running machine. Reality? A little different. My Grado SR80x headphones (still going strong, by the way!) are blasting my ASMR playlists, but my body is… protesting.

I’ve been stubbornly chasing pace, pushing too hard, too fast. It led to a frustrating plateau and a nagging knee. Then, last week, I just… slowed down. Seriously, *slowed down*. I focused on my breathing, the rhythm of my feet, and the feeling of the sun on my face. 

And you know what? It was amazing. I noticed the birds singing, the way the light filtered through the trees. I actually *enjoyed* the run. It wasn't about speed or distance; it was about being present. Maybe the best training isn't about pushing limits, but about finding joy in the simple act of moving. Who knew slow miles could be so rewarding?
