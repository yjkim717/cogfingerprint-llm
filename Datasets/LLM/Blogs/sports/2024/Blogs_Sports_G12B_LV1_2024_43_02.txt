## That Time My Childhood Sports Hero Became a Meme

Remember watching the '98 World Cup? I was obsessed with Davor Šuker. Croatian football felt *electric*. Fast forward to 2024, and I stumbled upon a bizarre TikTok – someone photoshopping Šuker’s face onto a fluffy Samoyed dog. It was ridiculous, instantly shareable, and oddly nostalgic. Suddenly, my childhood hero was a meme. It just goes to show how quickly icons shift, doesn't it?
