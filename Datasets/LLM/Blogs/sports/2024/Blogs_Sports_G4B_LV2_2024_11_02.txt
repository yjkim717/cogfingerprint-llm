**That One Game… And the “What Ifs”**

Anyone else ever replay a game in their head, *years* later? I was watching a highlight reel of my college team’s championship loss from 2018 the other day, and it hit me hard. We were up by five with thirty seconds left. A simple miss, a turnover – and it was over. 

It’s funny how hindsight transforms a crushing defeat into a mountain of “should-haves.”  Do the coaches regret the timeout? Do *I* regret forcing that last shot? It’s a frustrating, beautiful thing, isn’t it?  Those moments stick with you. #sports #reflection #championships
