>## Ditching the Numbers, Finding the Joy (and a New App!)

Okay, so I’ve been trying to get back into running this year. 2024 felt like a good time for a reset, you know? For ages, I was all about the data – miles logged, pace, heart rate… and, of course, calories in vs. calories out. I was *obsessed* with MyFitnessPal. But honestly, it started to suck the joy right out of it. 

I realised I was focusing on the numbers instead of the feeling of the run itself. The fresh air, the quiet, the little victories of pushing myself a bit further.  So, I’ve decided to scale back on the rigid tracking. 

I'm actually looking for a new app now, something simpler than MyFitnessPal, maybe just a basic calorie counter without all the subscription pressure. Any recommendations out there for UK-based runners? Let me know! Perhaps finding a less intense tracker will help me rediscover the love for running again.
