**The Smell of Segra Park & Rivalry**

There’s something about the start of college baseball season that just hits different, you know? This year, it’s all about the Clemson vs. South Carolina series – a rivalry that feels as old as the state itself. I’m already picturing myself at Segra Park, the sun warm on my face, and the unmistakable scent of hot dogs and freshly cut grass. 

It’s not just about the games, though. It’s about the tradition, the shared experience with friends and family, and that electric energy that runs through the stadium when the Tigers or Gamecocks are on the mound.  I remember watching those games with my dad growing up, and it created these incredible memories. 

This weekend feels like a chance to recapture a little bit of that feeling.  Who do you think will take the win? Let me know in the comments! #ClemsonBaseball #CollegeBaseball #SouthCarolina #SegraPark
