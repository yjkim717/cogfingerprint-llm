Looking back now in 2024, I can’t help but wonder if the writers of that iconic sports documentary ever have any regrets. You know the one—the underdog team’s story that captured our hearts, only to fumble in the final act. Did the creators second-guess their narrative choices, especially that controversial trade or the sidelining of a fan-favorite player? As fans, we invest so much emotionally; it’s natural to question if the storytellers would rewrite history given the chance. Hindsight, after all, has a way of revealing what truly resonates.
