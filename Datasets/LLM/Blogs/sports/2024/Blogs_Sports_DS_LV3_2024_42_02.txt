It’s 2024, and as a lifelong Gophers fan, I can’t help but feel a familiar pang of frustration watching our team struggle. Night after night, the same story unfolds: missed shots, sloppy plays, and a scoreboard that tells a tale of untapped potential.

I keep thinking about Ben Johnson and the coaching staff. In this era of NIL deals and high-stakes recruiting, have we lost sight of the fundamentals? It’s not just about landing big names; it’s about building players. The basics—consistent shooting, disciplined defense—seem to be an afterthought. You can see it in the players' eyes: they want to win, but are they being equipped to do so?

A change feels necessary, not as a punishment, but as a promise. A promise to our athletes and fans that we value growth, grit, and the core skills that make basketball beautiful. It’s time to rebuild, not just the roster, but the very foundation of how we play the game.
