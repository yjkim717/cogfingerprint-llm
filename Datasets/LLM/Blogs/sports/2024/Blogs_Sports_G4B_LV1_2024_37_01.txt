**Dust and Dreams: Remembering that Clemson-SC Series**

It’s funny how certain baseball weekends just stick with you, right? Last spring, I was lucky enough to catch a chunk of the Clemson Tigers versus South Carolina Gamecocks series at Segra Park. The energy was absolutely electric – a real taste of classic college baseball. 

I remember specifically watching Clemson’s starter, Miller, battling it out in the first game. He was throwing heat, but SC kept chipping away. There’s something about that back-and-forth tension, the roar of the crowd, and the palpable stakes that just grabs you. 

Even though Clemson ultimately won the series, it wasn't just about the wins. It was about the feeling of being part of something bigger, a tradition, a shared experience.  Those late-night conversations about the game, the smell of hot dogs – those are the moments that really make college baseball special.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, it’s not about the scoreboard, but the memories made.
