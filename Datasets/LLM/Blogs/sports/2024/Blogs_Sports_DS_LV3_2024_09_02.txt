As I watched the 2024 Olympic marathon, I couldn’t help but reflect on my own running journey. It’s funny—I used to chase personal bests, pushing through every ache for that fleeting high of a new record. But these days, my morning jogs are less about the clock and more about the rhythm of my breath, the sunrise painting the sky, and the quiet clarity that comes with movement.

Sports, I’ve realized, evolve with us. What once was a battleground for competition has become my sanctuary for mindfulness. It’s not about winning anymore; it’s about showing up, present and grateful, for the simple joy of being in motion.
