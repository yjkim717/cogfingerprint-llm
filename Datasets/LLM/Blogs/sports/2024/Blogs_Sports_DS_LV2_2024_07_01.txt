### The Echo of an Empty Net

I still remember the sound of the puck hitting the empty net with ten seconds left. It wasn't a roar from the crowd; it was a soft, definitive *thud* that sealed our fate. That was the moment in our high school championship where the comeback died.

It’s 2024 now, and I see the same pattern everywhere, even in the video games my nephew plays. They call it "snowballing"—that one early advantage that just builds and builds until the other side can’t possibly recover. A lucky bounce, a questionable call, and suddenly the game feels like it’s on a predetermined track.

Sports, at their best, are a testament to human spirit, to the belief that you can claw your way back from anything. But that empty net goal… it was a lesson in inevitability. It’s the cruel beauty of competition: sometimes, the other team just gets that first break, and the hill becomes a mountain. You can fight, but you’re already fighting the momentum of the entire game.
