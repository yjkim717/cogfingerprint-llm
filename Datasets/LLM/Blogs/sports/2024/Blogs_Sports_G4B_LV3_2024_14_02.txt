It’s that frantic, exciting feeling again – Week 9 in the Big 12!  You can practically taste the bowl game possibilities, and honestly, it’s a little dizzying. Kansas State snagging a bowl bid was a welcome surprise, injecting some momentum into the conference. But the real drama is brewing, isn’t it?
