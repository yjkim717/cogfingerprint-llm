## The Transfer Portal Glitch That Tested My Dynasty

Anyone else spend way too many hours lost in the world of college football dynasty mode? I know I do. This year, building my perfect program at State U has been *almost* therapeutic. Almost.

Then, it happened. Recruiting season rolled around, and the transfer portal… vanished. Just gone. A frustrating glitch locked me out of adding that crucial linebacker I desperately needed. Hours I spent scouting, planning, *dreaming* of that player – wasted. 

It's just a game, right? But it mirrored that feeling of having a plan derailed, of unexpected obstacles popping up. We all face those, don't we? Makes you appreciate the players who overcome adversity, both on the screen and in real life. Now, back to restarting...again!
