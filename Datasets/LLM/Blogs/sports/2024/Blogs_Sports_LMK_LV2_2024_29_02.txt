I'm trading my running shoes for flip flops this January 2024! After a year of pushing limits on the track, I'm craving a laid-back beach vacation. The Caribbean is calling, and I'm torn between Aruba and Curacao. Both promise serene shores and crystal-clear waters perfect for snorkeling. As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that sometimes, the best way to recharge is to slow down and soak up the sun. Where will I choose to unwind? Stay tuned for my island-hopping adventure and the ultimate showdown between these two Caribbean gems!
