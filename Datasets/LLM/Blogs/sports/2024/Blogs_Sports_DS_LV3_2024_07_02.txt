Another brutal loss. My 11th straight with teammates who seemed to just be phoning it in. This slump in Destiny 2 feels endless, like the game itself is against me. How do you find the motivation to push through when it feels like your own luck has abandoned you? The will to fight is the hardest boss to beat.
