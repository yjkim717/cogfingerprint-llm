### The Right Play: Why the Series S Was Our Black Friday Win

Scrolling through the Black Friday chaos, my mission was clear: get my son his first "real" console. The Xbox Series X with its disc drive and raw power was the obvious choice, right? But then I paused. I thought about his world—a landscape of Game Pass subscriptions and digital downloads with friends. He hasn’t bought a physical game in years.

That’s when the Series S, with its deep discount, clicked. It’s a digital console for a digital kid. Sure, I had that nagging "future-proof" worry, but the math was simple. The money we saved over the Series X more than covers a storage expansion card later if his library outgrows the SSD. It wasn’t about settling for less; it was about buying smart for his actual habits. Seeing his face light up when it booted confirmed it—we scored the perfect deal.
