## Late to the Party, Still Feels Like a Win

Okay, so I'm *really* late to this realization, but it hit me hard last week. Watching the underdog State University football team claw their way to a surprising win against the heavily favored Titans felt…familiar. Like listening to Forever the Sickest Kids’ *Underdog Alma Mater* for the first time. You know? That unexpected burst of energy, the scrappy determination? It reminded me of those early I See Stars days - raw, passionate, and defying expectations. Sometimes the best victories are the ones you didn’t see coming, right?
