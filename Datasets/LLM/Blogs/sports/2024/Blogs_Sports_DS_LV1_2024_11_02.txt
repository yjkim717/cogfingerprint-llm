Looking back at my final high school soccer game in 2024, I still feel that sting of regret. We were up by one with minutes left when I took that risky shot instead of passing to an open teammate. We lost in overtime. My coach never said "I told you so," but his disappointed sigh said it all. It taught me that in sports—and life—the moments we go it alone are often the ones we rethink for years.
