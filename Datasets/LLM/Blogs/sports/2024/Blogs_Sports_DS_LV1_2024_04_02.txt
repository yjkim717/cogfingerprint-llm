It’s 2024, and on paper, we’re set. We’ve got a Heisman-winning QB, open scholarships, and a legacy that should speak for itself. Yet here I am, watching the top transfer portal receivers and tight ends slip away, one after another.

It’s a strange kind of frustration. You have all the pieces that should make this a dream destination—a proven quarterback, a shot at a title, a full ride. But the conversations stall. Maybe it’s NIL, maybe it’s fit, but it feels like we’re locked out of the very market designed for this.

In this new era, having the tools isn’t enough. You have to sell the soul of the program, and sometimes, I wonder if ours is getting lost in translation.
