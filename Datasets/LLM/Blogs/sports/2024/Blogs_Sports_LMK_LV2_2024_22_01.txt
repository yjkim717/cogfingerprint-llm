As I watched my kid's soccer game in 2024, I couldn't help but notice the outbursts from a young player with ASD. It struck me - just like my friend's ASD toddler who reacts to crying kids, this child struggled with the loud environment. As a parent, I'd want my child to be supported, not just in sports, but in life's overwhelming moments. How can we foster a more inclusive, understanding atmosphere for all kids, regardless of their neurodiversity?
