You know, watching the 2024 Olympic trials this week, I was struck by a simple truth. It’s not always the perfect dive or the flawless routine that wins. It’s the one who gets back up after a stumble. I saw a gymnast fall, then nail her next pass with more fire than before. That’s the real victory. It reminded me that our greatest strength isn't in avoiding failure, but in how we respond to it.
