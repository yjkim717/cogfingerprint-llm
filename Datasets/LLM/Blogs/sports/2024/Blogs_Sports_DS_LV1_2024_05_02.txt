It’s 2024, and the new CBA is reshaping how teams think about star power. Watching MPJ’s recent trade rumors unfold, I can’t help but reflect: the days of handing out max deals to one-dimensional players are fading. Now, durability and two-way impact are everything. If you can’t defend or stay on the court, your value plummets. It’s a tough but necessary shift—rewarding those who truly elevate the team, not just the highlight reel. The game’s evolving, and so is the business behind it.
