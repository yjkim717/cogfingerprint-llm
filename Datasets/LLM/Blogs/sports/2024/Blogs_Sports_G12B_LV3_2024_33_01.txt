## Remember When College Football Playoff Games Were… Predictable?

Okay, let’s be honest. Anyone who followed college football back in the early days of the College Football Playoff (CFP) remembers a certain… *pattern*. Semifinal games often devolved into blowouts. One team would establish dominance early, and the rest of the game felt like a formality. Exciting? Not always. Nail-biting? Rarely.

I distinctly recall a few years where I was already thinking about what to order for dinner by halftime. It felt like the hype surrounding the CFP didn't *quite* match the reality of the games themselves. 

But something shifted. And it's been wonderfully, delightfully obvious over the last couple of seasons. This year, 2024, has continued that trend. We’ve seen a real change in the caliber of competition. The semifinal games haven't been the predictable processions they once were. Instead, we've been treated to genuinely close games, contests that kept us on the edge of our seats until the very last second.

It’s made watching so much more rewarding. It’s sparked more conversations, more debates, and more genuine excitement among fans. 

What does this shift mean? Maybe parity is truly leveling the playing field. Perhaps the increased emphasis on strategic coaching and player development is playing a role. Or maybe it’s just a natural evolution of the sport. Whatever the reason, I, for one, am here for it. Bring on the close games – they’re what make college football playoff season truly special.
