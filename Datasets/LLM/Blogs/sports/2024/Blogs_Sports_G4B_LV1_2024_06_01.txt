**A Moment for KAT?**

It’s wild to think about how quickly careers can shift in the NBA. Watching the Timberwolves this season, you couldn't help but feel the energy around Karl-Anthony Towns. That playoff run, despite the ultimate outcome, felt like a real testament to his dedication.

But a player with his impact deserves a place of honor.  Let’s hope the front office recognizes what he brought to the franchise – it’s time to celebrate a truly special player.
