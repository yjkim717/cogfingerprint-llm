**The Shot That Felt Like a Loss**

Anyone who’s ever played a team sport knows that feeling – that gut-wrenching moment when you’re down, *really* down, and a single play could change everything. I remember one game of volleyball back in 2024. We were losing badly, set point looming. Our serve was consistently getting blocked, and the other team just seemed to *know* where we were going to hit the ball. 

It felt impossible. Like we were stuck in a rut, unable to create any momentum. Then, suddenly, my teammate Liam stepped up. He executed a perfect tip, right into a gap in their defense. It wasn’t a spectacular play, just…smart. 

That single point sparked something. We started communicating better, adjusting our strategy, and suddenly, we clawed our way back. It wasn't a complete victory, but that one shot, that one moment of resilience, reminded me that sometimes, a comeback isn’t about winning, it’s about fighting for the possibility.  It’s about refusing to accept the initial feeling of defeat.
