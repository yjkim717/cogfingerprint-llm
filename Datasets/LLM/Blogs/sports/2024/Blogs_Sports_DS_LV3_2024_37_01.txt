There’s something electric about a South Carolina–Clemson baseball weekend. It’s more than just a game; it’s a tradition that pulses through the state. This March, the real drama will unfold on the mound. As the starting pitchers take their spots, you can feel the weight of the rivalry in every pitch. It’s a test of skill, yes, but also of heart. For us fans, these games are a shared story—a reminder of why we love this sport and the communities it builds around a simple diamond.
