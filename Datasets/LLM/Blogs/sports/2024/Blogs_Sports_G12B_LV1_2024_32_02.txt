>## The Weight of Potential: Reflecting on Texas College Football

It's tough to watch a program struggle. Lately, I’ve been following the situation unfolding at Texas College, and it's been a real gut punch. You hear about Power Five schools and their million-dollar budgets, but the stories that often get lost are the ones from smaller institutions, the NAIA programs brimming with potential, and the kids pouring their hearts into the game.

Texas College’s football program, historically a source of pride for the community, has been navigating some serious headwinds this year. Reports of player removals and ongoing athletic certification hurdles have painted a bleak picture. It makes you wonder, what does the future hold?

Beyond the wins and losses, these programs are often lifelines for young men. They offer a chance at education, a platform to build a future, and a community to belong to. When those opportunities are threatened, it’s devastating. 

I'm not an expert, but I do know that rebuilding takes work – dedication from coaches, unwavering support from the administration, and, most importantly, belief in the players. Let’s hope Texas College can find its footing and provide these athletes with the chance they deserve to shine. It's a reminder that sports, at their core, are about more than just the scoreboard.
