**The Unexpected Timeout**

You know those moments in a game where everything just…grinds to a halt? Not a whistle, not a call, but a sudden, unsettling stillness? That’s what I felt watching my niece, Lily, compete in her first ever basketball tournament this weekend. She was playing so fiercely, so determined, and she’d completely locked herself out of her phone – and, consequently, her team’s communication channel.

It sounds small, I know. But for a ten-year-old who’s been obsessing over every play and keeping track of stats on her iPhone, it was a major crisis. She’d forgotten her iCloud password, and the whole recovery process with Apple Support felt like an endless loop of frustration.  It mirrored that feeling of being stuck – a frustrating timeout in the middle of a game.

I remembered my own moments of feeling completely lost during high school soccer. That overwhelming panic when you realize you’ve completely blanked on a play, or a teammate’s name.  Lily was experiencing something similar, and it was heartbreaking to watch. 

Thankfully, with a little patient guidance (and a lot of reminding!), we finally got her back online.  It wasn't a triumphant victory, but it was a reminder that sometimes, the biggest challenges aren't about winning or losing, but about navigating those unexpected pauses.  It's about finding a way to reset, refocus, and get back in the game.
