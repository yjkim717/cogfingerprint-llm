## Is Something Seriously Wrong with Minnesota Gopher Basketball?

Okay, Gopher fans, let's be honest with each other. Watching our basketball team lately has felt… tough. Really tough. I’m not talking about a few close losses; I’m talking about a consistent lack of fundamentals. Passes sailing wide, missed layups, defensive breakdowns – it’s been a recurring theme this season, and it’s hard to ignore.

I know, I know. The landscape of college basketball has shifted dramatically. NIL deals and the transfer portal have created a whole new ballgame. It’s harder than ever to build a program and retain talent. But shouldn't the basics still matter? Shouldn’t we see some consistent execution, regardless of who’s on the court?

It’s gotten to the point where I’m wondering if a change in coaching is necessary. It’s a weighty thought, and I’m not saying it lightly. But as a long-time fan of Dawson Garcia and the Gophers, I’m starting to feel like something needs to shift significantly if we want to see a turnaround. Maybe it’s time to seriously evaluate what’s working – and what desperately isn’t. What are your thoughts? Let’s talk about it.
