It’s wild to watch players like Travis Hunter, isn’t it? This season, seeing those PFF grades – an 88.3 as a receiver *and* above average as a corner – really got me thinking. It’s not just about talent, but about the sheer willingness to do *everything*.  He’s dominating on offense, locking down defenses, and even handling special teams.  It’s a reminder that impact in sports comes from embracing every role and truly understanding the game.  What versatile players do you admire this year?
