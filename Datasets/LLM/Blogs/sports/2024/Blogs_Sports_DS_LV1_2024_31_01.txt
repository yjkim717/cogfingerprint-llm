Looking back on 2024, it’s wild how much combat sports have evolved. I remember when weight classes like welterweight and light heavyweight were all we talked about—now, we’re buzzing about Power Slap 6’s super heavyweight title fight. It’s a reminder that every athlete, whether throwing punches or open-handed slaps, carries the same dream: to be champion. Sometimes, the platform changes, but that raw hunger for glory? That never goes out of style.
