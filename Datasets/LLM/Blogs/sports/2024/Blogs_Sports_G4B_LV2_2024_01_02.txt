**The Weight of a New Jersey Jersey**

It's funny how certain things stick with you, right? I’m talking about more than just a great game-winning shot. Last year, my son, Leo, was obsessed with getting a New Jersey Devils jersey – the iconic red and black. He was ten, just like the kid in that Xbox debate, seriously weighing the pros and cons of different consoles. 

He wasn’t thinking about future-proofing, of course, but he *was* thinking about what felt right *now*. That jersey represented everything he loved about hockey, about the team, about the thrill of the game. 

It made me think about my own childhood. I had a worn-out Yankees cap, a constant reminder of Dad taking me to games, the smell of hot dogs, and the electric feeling of rooting for the home team. 

Sometimes, it’s not about the biggest, fanciest thing. It’s about that initial spark, that feeling of belonging.  Just like choosing between an Xbox Series S and X, Leo was trying to find something that truly resonated with him.  And honestly, that’s a pretty good analogy for life, isn’t it?
