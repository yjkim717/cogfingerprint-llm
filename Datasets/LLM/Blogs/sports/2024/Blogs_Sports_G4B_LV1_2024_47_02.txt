**The Ghosts of the 5-Out**

Seriously, anyone else still haunted by those teams that just *moved* you? We saw it a lot in college – the relentless 5-out offense, stretching you to your absolute limit. This season, I’ve been watching some pro games, and it’s striking how much teams are still struggling with it. 

It's not just about speed, though. It’s about forcing you to abandon your man-to-man defense and scrambling for rim protection. When our bigs weren’t locking down the post, we were doomed.  It's a reminder that sometimes, the most sophisticated schemes can’t overcome fundamental weaknesses.  Anyone else have a similar experience?
