I'm obsessed with the idea of self-imposed challenges, and I've found a new favorite pastime - Slay the Spire. One gamer's 'no-attack Defect' challenge caught my eye, and I started thinking about similar challenges in sports. What if I tried running without training for a week? Or played a game of basketball with my non-dominant hand? The idea of 'conduct challenges' got me hooked. I started experimenting with different self-imposed hurdles, like completing a tough workout without any prep. The thrill lies not just in the challenge, but in the process of pushing my limits. As we step into 2024, I'm excited to take on more challenges, testing my resolve and willpower. Who knows what hidden strengths I'll uncover? The Slay the Spire community has shown me that the right challenge can be a powerful catalyst for growth.
