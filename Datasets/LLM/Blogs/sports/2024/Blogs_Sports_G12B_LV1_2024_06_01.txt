## Beyond the Numbers: KAT and a Timberwolves Legacy

It's 2024, and the Timberwolves are buzzing. Seeing Karl-Anthony Towns thrive alongside Edwards has been incredible. But it got me thinking: should we seriously consider retiring KAT’s jersey? It's more than just about All-Star appearances or impressive stats. It’s about the resilience he showed after tragedy, the heart he’s poured into this franchise, and the undeniable impact he’s had on Minnesota basketball. It feels like a conversation worth having.
