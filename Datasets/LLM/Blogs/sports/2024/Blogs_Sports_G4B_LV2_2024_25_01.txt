**The Weight of Expectations: Why We Need to See Shane Slafkovsky Thrive**

Let’s be honest, watching hockey can be a frustrating experience sometimes, right? You see a high draft pick – like Shane Slafkovsky with the Habs – and the pressure immediately mounts. Suddenly, every missed shot, every hesitant pass is dissected and debated endlessly. 

I find myself feeling a little protective of players in this position. It’s easy to judge from the comfort of our couches, but it's a *lot* to handle.  I remember being a kid, wanting so badly for my favorite player to succeed – it felt like my happiness hinged on it! 

But Slafkovsky isn't a point guard; he’s a power forward. He needs time to develop, to find his role within the team and with his line mates.  Let’s shift our focus from immediate results to recognizing his potential.  Instead of criticizing, let’s root for him to grow into the force the Canadiens envisioned.  It's time to give him the space to build, and trust the process. What do you think?
