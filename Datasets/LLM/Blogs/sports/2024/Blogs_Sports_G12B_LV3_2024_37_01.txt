## The Rivalry Lives On: College Baseball and Those Saturday Feels

There's something electric about college baseball, isn't there? This year, 2024, the South Carolina Gamecocks and Clemson Tigers are renewing their classic rivalry with a three-game series. I saw the schedule pop up on Reddit – Segra Park is hosting, which is awesome! ACC Network Extra will be broadcasting, so you can catch the action.

What always gets me is the passion. It’s not just about the game; it's about the history, the tradition, the bragging rights. Knowing the starting pitchers adds another layer of anticipation. It’s those Saturday afternoons, the crack of the bat, and the roar of the crowd that truly define college sports.
