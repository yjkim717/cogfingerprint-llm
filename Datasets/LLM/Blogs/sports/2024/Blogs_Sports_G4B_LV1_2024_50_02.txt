Okay, so I was driving down Elm Street yesterday, and it was *weird*. They’d completely trimmed the median near the Maple Avenue intersection – practically shaved it down! Seriously, what’s the deal? It just felt… abrupt. Reminded me of a sudden change in a game – you’re building momentum, then *bam*, a new rule throws everything off. Makes you wonder about the bigger picture, you know?  Anyone else notice this crazy road work?
