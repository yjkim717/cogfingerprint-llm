## Beyond the Play-In: Do We Really Give Teams Enough Credit?

Remember the chatter after the Lakers clinched a playoff spot this year? Charles Barkley, bless his heart, was quick to downplay it, suggesting the play-in tournament was the *only* reason they were in. Honestly, it got me thinking. 

We, as fans, are so quick to diminish achievements when they don't look a certain way, aren't we? We crave dominant regular seasons, easy sweeps, the whole Hollywood ending. But what about the teams grinding it out, battling injuries, finding their rhythm *during* the playoffs? 

Bill Simmons always talks about narrative, and sometimes I think we force narratives instead of just *seeing* what's in front of us. The Lakers, despite the play-in, held a consistent playoff seed. Thatâ€™s something. It speaks to resilience, adjustments, and a core belief.

Maybe it's a bit idealistic, but I hope we can appreciate the journey, the grit, even when it doesn't follow the perfectly scripted storyline. Because even contenders often take the less glamorous route to the championship. And that, to me, is pretty compelling.
