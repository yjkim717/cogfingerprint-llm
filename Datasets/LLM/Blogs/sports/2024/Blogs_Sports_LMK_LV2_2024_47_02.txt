"Lessons from the Sidelines: Finding My Why in Sports"

As I stepped off the court in 2024, exhausted but exhilarated, I realized that sports had given me more than just a hobby - it had given me a sense of purpose. Reflecting on my journey, I understood that the thrill of competition wasn't just about winning, but about the camaraderie, perseverance, and self-discovery that came with it. Sports taught me to be resilient, to push beyond my limits, and to support others in their own struggles. As I hang up my jersey, I'm reminded that the true victory lies not in the score, but in the lessons learned and the connections made along the way.
