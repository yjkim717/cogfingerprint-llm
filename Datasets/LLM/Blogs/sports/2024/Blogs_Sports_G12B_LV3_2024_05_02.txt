## Are We Loving Max Contracts a Little *Too* Much?

Okay, NBA fans, let's talk. Something's been bouncing around my head ever since I saw a Reddit thread blowing up about it. With the current CBA, it feels like handing out max contracts is becoming… complicated. We're seeing some incredibly talented players, sure, but are they *truly* justifying those massive salaries on both ends of the court? 

Michael Porter Jr. came up a lot in the discussion, and it got me thinking. It’s tough, right? We love the highlight reels, but the game demands so much more. Are we, as fans, maybe overlooking the all-around impact when we celebrate these huge deals? Just a thought to chew on while we watch the rest of this season unfold.
