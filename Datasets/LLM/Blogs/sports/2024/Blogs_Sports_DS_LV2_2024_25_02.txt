My Garmin buzzed this morning with its daily suggested workout. Again. As I laced up in the quiet 2024 dawn, I wondered: can this watch on my wrist truly replace a human coach?

It’s a question of trust. Do I surrender to the algorithm’s cold calculus, or listen to the familiar ache in my legs? The promise of a perfect half-marathon pace is alluring, but running has always been about more than data. It’s the messy, personal journey between the start line and the finish, a story no watch can fully write.
