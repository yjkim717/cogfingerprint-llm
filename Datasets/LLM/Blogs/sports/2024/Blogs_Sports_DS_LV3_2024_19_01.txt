The gym used to be my sanctuary—a place of clanging iron and quiet determination. But walking in here lately, something feels different. I’m not talking about the new equipment or the playlist; I’m talking about the kids, barely out of high school, chasing a physique that screams “social media ready.”

I was 19 once, hungry for gains, but we chased strength. Today, I see boys with vascularity and bulk that doesn’t match their age, and my heart sinks. Just last week, I pulled aside a young lifter—let’s call him Jake. He couldn’t have been more than 20. I asked him about his routine, and he hesitated before admitting he’d started a cycle. “Just to keep up,” he said, eyes darting toward his phone, probably thinking of some influencer’s “natural” transformation.

It hit me then: this isn’t about vanity alone. It’s the pressure—the curated, filtered version of fitness that floods their screens daily. Steroids aren’t a shortcut; they’re a dangerous detour with lifelong costs—heart issues, hormonal shutdown, mental health struggles.

I’ve been lifting for over 15 years. My biggest gains weren’t measured in kilos but in patience and respect for my body. I hope Jake, and others like him, realize that true strength isn’t built in a cycle. It’s built rep by honest rep, over time. Your future self will thank you for the wait.
