It was the final match of our 2024 summer league, the score tied. My penalty kick—the moment I’d practiced for—ended in a weak, deflected shot. Later, reviewing the footage, my coach pointed it out: a subtle hitch in my plant foot, a blockage in my technique no amount of simple drills could fix. It wasn't about trying harder; it was about finding the right tool, the precise adjustment to clean up the motion. Sometimes the smallest, most stubborn flaw is what stands between you and ignition.
