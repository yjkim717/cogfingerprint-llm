## The Weight of History: Washington, Michigan, and the Long Road to Glendale

It’s January 8th, 2024, and the air is buzzing. The National Championship is set: Washington versus Michigan. But beyond the excitement of the game itself, something struck me as I was watching the pre-game coverage – the sheer weight of history these two programs carry.

Both Washington and Michigan are here, battling for the ultimate prize, and both are… first-timers. Seriously. Michigan hasn’t hoisted a national championship trophy since 1997. For those of us who remember, that feels like a lifetime ago. And Washington? Their last title was way back in 1991. Decades of near misses, heartbreaking losses, and the constant pressure of expectations.

It really puts things into perspective, doesn't it? We get so caught up in the wins and losses of a single season, but these programs have endured years – *eras* – of championship droughts. It makes you appreciate the journey, the resilience, and the unwavering belief it takes to even *get* to this point.

Thinking about it, how many times have fans of these programs felt their hopes dashed? How many times did they wonder if they’d ever see their team on this stage again? 

Tonight, one of them will rewrite history. And for the other? Well, they’ll carry the burden of history a little longer, knowing they came so close. It’s a powerful reminder that in sports, as in life, the road to success is rarely a straight line.
