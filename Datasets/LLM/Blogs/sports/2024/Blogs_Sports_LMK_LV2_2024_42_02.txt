"As I watched the Gophers basketball team struggle on the court in 2024, I couldn't help but think about the impact of coaching on team performance. The lack of basic skills and cohesion was glaring, and it wasn't long before fans started calling for a change at the helm. Ben's coaching style, once touted as a game-changer, was now being scrutinized. The NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) phenomenon, which was supposed to be a boon for college athletics, seemed to be having an unintended consequence - a focus on individual talent over team unity. As I reflected on the team's struggles, I realized that sometimes it's the fundamentals that need attention. Coaching basics like discipline, teamwork, and skill-building are just as important as flashy recruiting. The Gophers' woes serve as a reminder that success in sports is often built on the basics, not just star power."
