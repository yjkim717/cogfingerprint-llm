The frustration of college football dynasty mode is real. In my latest EA Sports CFB game, I found myself stuck in a recruiting rut. With open scholarships and plenty of playing time available, I expected to land top transfer portal talent. But despite my best efforts, I came up empty-handed. It's a familiar feeling for gamers and real-life coaches alike. As we head into the 2024 season, I'm left wondering: what makes a player choose one program over another? Is it just about the game, or is there more to it?
