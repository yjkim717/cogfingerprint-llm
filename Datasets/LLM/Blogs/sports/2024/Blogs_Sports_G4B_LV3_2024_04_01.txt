**The Lakers’ Play-In Myth – And Why Barkley Misses the Point**

Let’s be honest, 2024 sports debates can get…heated.  I was scrolling through some old Charles Barkley takes the other day, and he was really pushing the idea that the Lakers wouldn’t have even *gotten* into the playoffs without the play-in tournament. It just didn’t sit right. 

As a longtime fan, I’ve watched the Lakers consistently battle for that 7-seed spot. That consistent performance – that grit – speaks volumes. It’s a testament to a team that’s built a system, not reliant on a single, lucky win in a chaotic bracket. 

Bill Simmons often points out the narratives, and sometimes those narratives are right. But sometimes, we get so caught up in the drama of the play-in that we forget to appreciate the steady, reliable excellence of a team like the Lakers. It’s a reminder that consistency still matters, even in the wild world of today’s NBA.
