It’s 2024, and I’m watching Gophers basketball with a familiar ache in my chest. It’s not just the losses; it’s *how* we lose. Under Ben Johnson, the fundamentals feel like a forgotten language. Simple passes go astray, defensive rotations are a step slow, and player development seems stagnant, NIL or not.

I keep thinking about the raw talent on the court—kids with so much potential. But potential needs direction. It needs a coach who builds a foundation, brick by brick. Right now, it feels like the foundation is sand.

This is more than a coaching failure; it’s a lost connection. We fans invest our hope in these teams. We see ourselves in their hustle. Right now, that reflection is blurry, and the story it tells is one we’ve read too many times before. It’s time to turn the page.
