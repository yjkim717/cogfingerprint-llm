**The Quiet Strength of a Wolverines' Defense**

It’s funny how we often focus on the flash – the big plays, the game-winning shots – when analyzing a team’s success. But this year, as I was digging into the Michigan Wolverines’ 2023 season, I kept circling back to something far more subtle: their defense. 

I stumbled across a Reddit thread analyzing their performance in “garbage time” – those final minutes where the outcome’s largely decided. And the numbers were surprisingly revealing: just 19.8% of points conceded during those crucial moments. 

That’s not just good; it’s *remarkable*. It suggests a level of discipline and mental fortitude that goes way beyond the highlight reel. It’s the quiet strength of a team that doesn’t crumble under pressure, that continues to grind and defend, even when the scoreboard’s already leaning their way.  It made me think about how often we miss the details that truly define a team’s character.
