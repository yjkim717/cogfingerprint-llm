"Leveling Up My Golf Game: Embracing Self-Imposed Challenges. As I stepped onto the golf course in the spring of 2024, I couldn't help but think of my favorite video game, Slay the Spire. Just like in the game, I've started imposing self-challenges on myself to take my golf to the next level. Inspired by the permadeath challenges of NetHack, I decided to try out a 'No-Driver' conduct - ditching my trusty driver for the entire round. At first, it felt like a handicap (pun intended!), but it forced me to rethink my strategy and rely on my other clubs. As I navigated the course, I felt a sense of ascension, not just in my score, but in my overall skill. It was a tough challenge, but the sense of accomplishment was exhilarating. Who knew that a self-imposed constraint could be just what I needed to 'slay the course'?"
