Of course, here is a reflective blog post related to sports.

I’ll never forget my first 5K in 2024. The gun went off, and I bolted, fueled by adrenaline and months of training. But by the second mile, my lungs were on fire. Everyone started passing me. The finish line felt a universe away.

Then, an older runner fell into stride beside me. “Easy now,” he puffed with a grin. “The race is long. Find your rhythm.”

That simple shift changed everything. I stopped racing them and started running for me. Crossing that finish line, exhausted and elated, I didn’t just complete a race—I learned a lesson in patience I’ll carry far beyond the track.
