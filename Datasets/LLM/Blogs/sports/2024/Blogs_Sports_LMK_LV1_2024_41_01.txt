"Breaking Down the AP Poll: Who's Voting with the Herd in College Basketball?

As we dive into the 2024 college basketball season, I took a closer look at the AP Poll voters and their preseason rankings. I was curious to see just how consistent individual voters were with the group as a whole. Were there any outliers, or did everyone pretty much agree on the top teams?

After crunching the numbers, I was surprised to find that some voters stood out for their consistency - or lack thereof. It turns out that some voters are closely in tune with the overall rankings, while others seem to be swimming against the tide. I sorted the voters by their similarity to the group, and the results were telling. The most consistent voters were largely in line with the overall rankings, while the outliers were often driven by more nuanced or contrarian views. It's a fascinating look at the minds behind the ballots, and a fun exercise in understanding the intricacies of the AP Poll."
