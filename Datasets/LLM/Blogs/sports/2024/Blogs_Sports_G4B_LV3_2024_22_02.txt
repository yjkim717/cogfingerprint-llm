Input: flow state, managers, ic, hands-on work, blissful moments
Output: There’s a feeling in tennis, right? Like the ball is almost *too* predictable, you’re moving instinctively, and time just melts away. That’s flow. As an IC, I’m always striving for those “blissful moments” – diving into hands-on work, feeling fully engaged. I wonder, how do managers create that same immersive experience for their teams?
