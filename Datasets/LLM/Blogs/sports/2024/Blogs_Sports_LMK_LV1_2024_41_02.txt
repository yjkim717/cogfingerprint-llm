As I scrolled through Reddit's sports forum in 2024, I couldn't help but think about the chaos that ensues when a viral tweet makes the rounds. With Twitter rebranding as X.com, I've noticed that identical links to the same content are being shared on Reddit - some with the old twitter.com domain, others with the new x.com. It's frustrating for users and moderators alike. I wish there was a way to flag these duplicates. A repost detection system that checks for identical links, regardless of the domain, would be a game-changer. It would streamline the moderation process and improve the overall user experience.
