Ever have one of those golf moments that just stops you in your tracks? I was at the range yesterday, flushing my 4-iron and my pitching wedge with what felt like the same smooth tempo. The contact was pure, the mechanics felt sound. Yet, both balls landed in an almost identical spot. In 2024, with all our tech and data, it’s humbling. It’s a stark reminder that the game’s real secrets aren't always in the club's number, but in the nuanced dance of strike and speed.
