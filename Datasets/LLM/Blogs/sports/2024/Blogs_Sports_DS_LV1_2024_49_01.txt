It’s 2024, and I’m still shaking my head at the state of football management. For years, I poured my heart into Southport—taking them from the depths of the Vanarama National League to the cusp of the Football League. We played attractive football, developed young talent, and punched well above our weight. I thought that counted for something.

Then came the QPR job—a Championship side with potential, but struggling. I threw my name in the ring, confident my track record spoke for itself. But what happened? They hired a former player with zero managerial experience. None. Just a famous face and a few contacts.

It stings, honestly. Clubs talk about merit and vision, but too often they chase glamour over grit. I’m not saying I deserved it automatically, but surely years of proven success should mean more than a flashy reputation? Maybe it’s time to rethink what we value in a leader—on and off the pitch.
