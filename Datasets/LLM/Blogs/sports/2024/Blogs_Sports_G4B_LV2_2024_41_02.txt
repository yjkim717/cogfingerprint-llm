**The Echo in the Crowd**

Anyone else feel that weird sense of déjà vu at a game? Like you’ve *seen* that tweet, that highlight, that specific angle before? It’s crazy how quickly things spread online, especially with all the cross-posting happening these days. 

I was thinking about it after watching the [Insert Sport Here] finals – so many links bouncing around on Twitter and X.com. It got me wondering if Reddit could maybe help us out, flagging those repeated links, just to cut through the noise and give both fans and moderators a little breathing room.  Wouldn't it be great to focus on the *moment* instead of chasing the same content everywhere?

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a different draft with a different sport?
