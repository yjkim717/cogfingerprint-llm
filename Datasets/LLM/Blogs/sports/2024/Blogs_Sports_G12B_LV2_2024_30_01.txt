## Does He Even *Know* Who You're Talking About?

It's 2024, and the NBA is bigger than ever. But it got me thinking the other day – how much do our partners *really* know about the sport we love? A Reddit thread popped up asking which players non-basketball-fan significant others could recognize, and the answers were hilarious. Apparently, LeBron’s pretty much a household name, and Devin Booker seems to have gained some serious recognition too!

It made me chuckle, remembering trying to explain box scores to my own partner last year. Blank stares all around. It's a funny disconnect, isn't it? We get so invested in these athletes, these rivalries, these moments… and sometimes the people we love most just see a bunch of guys in shorts running around. 

Maybe it's okay though. Maybe our passion is enough. And hey, at least we have the games to obsess over!
