**The Day My Headphones Broke My Flow**

Okay, so this happened last week, and honestly, it’s still a little weird. I was really locked in, running through my interval training playlist on my AirPods – you know, that super motivating stuff with the driving beats – when suddenly, the panning just went haywire. Every sound was stuck on one side of the stereo, like a terrible echo. 

It was incredibly frustrating! I’d tweaked the track output in Logic Studio, trying to get the perfect balance, and it just… crashed. Turns out, the AirPods were the culprit. Switching to my headphones instantly fixed it. 

It’s a crazy reminder that sometimes the simplest solutions are the best.  It made me think about how reliant we are on tech, and how easily a small glitch can derail even the most focused workout.  Lesson learned: always have a backup!  Anyone else experience tech hiccups ruining their routine lately?
