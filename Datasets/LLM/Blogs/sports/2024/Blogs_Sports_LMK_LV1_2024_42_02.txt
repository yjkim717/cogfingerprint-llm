The Gophers' 2024 season has been a major letdown. As a long-time fan, it's disheartening to watch the team struggle with the fundamentals. Coach Ben's inability to instill basic skills in his players is glaring. The nil performance in crucial games is a stark reminder of the team's shortcomings. Take free throws, for instance - a skill that's supposed to be a no-brainer. Yet, the Gophers consistently choke, showcasing a lack of composure under pressure. It's not just about the Xs and Os; it's about basketball IQ. The team's inability to read the game and make smart decisions is a major issue. As the season draws to a close, it's clear that Coach Ben and the Gophers have a lot of work to do if they want to turn things around.
