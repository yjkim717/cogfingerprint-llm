**The Baba Question: When Does a Sprint Cross the Line?**

Okay, so I’ve been obsessing over this clip from *Taskmaster* – that double points challenge with the carrots! Seriously, was Baba’s run *really* a brisk walk? It felt like a full-on sprint to me. 

It got me thinking about rules in any sport, really. Where’s the gray area?  Alex was so adamant about the "brisk walk" – and it’s easy to judge from the sofa, right? But watching Baba, it just looked like a burst of energy.  Makes you wonder if a little leeway is sometimes needed!
