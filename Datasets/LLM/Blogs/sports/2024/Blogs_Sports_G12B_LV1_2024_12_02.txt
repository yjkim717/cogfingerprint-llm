>## The Unexpected Agony of a Single Point

Okay, I’m officially admitting defeat. Not in a major competition, or on a grand scale, but in a tiny, pixelated chess mini-game on my phone. It sounds ridiculous, I know. But after an hour of frustrated tapping, I'm starting to understand why some athletes talk about the mental toll of pressure, even in seemingly small moments.

The premise is simple: get a pawn to the other side and promote it to win. Easy, right? Except my opponent is a relentlessly aggressive knight. It's like trying to shepherd a runaway sheep through a minefield. Every step forward feels like a calculated risk, and the knight is *always* there, anticipating, harassing, ready to pounce.

It's humbling. It's infuriating. It’s a tiny, digital representation of the agonizing inches that separate victory from defeat. I’m sure a grandmaster wouldn’t bat an eye, but for me, this little game is a surprisingly potent reminder that even the smallest challenges can feel monumental when you're striving for that single, elusive point. Back to the drawing board (or, you know, the phone screen) I guess.
