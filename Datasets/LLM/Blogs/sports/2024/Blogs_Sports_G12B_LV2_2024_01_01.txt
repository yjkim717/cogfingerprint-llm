>## The Unexpected Joy of Slow Progress

Remember the days of obsessively tracking every rep, every mile, every calorie? I do. Last year, I was *all* about peak performance, pushing myself relentlessly in the gym. Burnout hit hard. 

This year, I've shifted gears. I'm focusing on consistency, not intensity. A shorter run, a slightly lighter weight – and honestly? It feels *better*. The pressure's gone, replaced with a quiet satisfaction. It’s a slower journey, sure, but the joy is in the everyday, in showing up for myself, even when it’s just a little bit. Sometimes, progress isn't about explosive leaps, it's about steady, sustainable steps. And that’s a victory in itself.
