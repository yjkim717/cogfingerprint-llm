"Getting Real with Football Manager: A Southport Success Story's QPR Snub. As I sat in front of my screen, guiding my Southport team to yet another promotion in Football Manager 2024, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. My tactics were spot on, and the lads were firing on all cylinders. So, when the QPR manager's job came up, I thought I'd be the perfect candidate. I mean, who better to turn around a struggling Championship side than the mastermind behind Southport's lower-league dominance? But, as the simulated job went to a more 'experienced' coach, I was left scratching my head. Doesn't FM's AI know that success is success, regardless of the league? I've won trophies and climbed the ranks with Southport; shouldn't that count for something? Alas, it seems the game's logic is still lost on me. Still, I'll keep on managing â€“ and maybe one day, my virtual CV will be taken seriously."
