As I stepped out for a brisk walk in 2024, I couldn't help but think of Taskmaster's latest shenanigans. Baba's 10-pointer in the double points task had me scratching my head - was it a DQD (Disqualification for Utter Derangement) in the making? The more I pondered, the more I questioned the score. Was it a rule break, or was I just caught up in the Taskmaster magic? The debate still rages on.
