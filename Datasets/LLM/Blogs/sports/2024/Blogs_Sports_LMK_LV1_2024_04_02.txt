The struggles of building a dynasty in EA Sports CFB - I'm all too familiar with them. This offseason, I found myself locked out of top transfer portal targets despite having open scholarships. It was frustrating, to say the least. I had done my research, identified the players I needed to fill gaps on my roster, and yet I was unable to recruit them. As I navigated the 2024 transfer portal, I couldn't help but wonder if the game's recruiting mechanics were truly realistic. One thing's for sure - it's a challenge that'll make or break a virtual dynasty.
