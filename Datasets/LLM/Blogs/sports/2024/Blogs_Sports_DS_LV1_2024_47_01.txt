It’s 2024, and I’m still learning that basketball isn’t just about strength—it’s about intelligence. I remember trying to back down this aggressive defender in a rec league game last month. He threw an arm bar on me, cutting off all my leverage. I felt stuck, frustrated.

Then it hit me: why fight force with force? Instead of battling for position, I started using quick entry passes to myself, creating space before he could set his defense. Suddenly, I wasn’t playing his game anymore. That shift changed everything—not just for that play, but for my whole approach. Sometimes the smartest move isn’t to push harder, but to pivot and adapt. It’s a lesson that goes way beyond the court.
