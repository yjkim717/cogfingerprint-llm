**The Day My Xumo Died (and My Patience Did Too)**

Okay, let’s be real – 2024 is *the* year for streaming, right? I’ve been trying to embrace it, really I have. I even got an Xumo box, thinking it’d be a simple way to catch all the Sunday football. But let me tell you, it was anything but. 

I spent a solid hour wrestling with connection errors, resetting the box, and generally feeling like a frustrated tech support agent. Honestly, it was draining!  It got me thinking about how much I just crave the *reliability* of a good old cable box. 

I ended up requesting a new one from Spectrum. There’s something comforting about just pressing play and knowing it’s going to work.  Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but sometimes the simplest solutions are the best.  Anyone else had a similar tech meltdown over sports viewing?  Let me know in the comments!
