As I watched the 2024 luxury car show, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between high-end vehicles and high-performance sports. Just as the BMW 7 Series boasts chauffeur-oriented features and rear-seat amenities, top athletes rely on their support teams to optimize their performance. But what's holding back innovation? The 7 Series lacks a chilled drink cooler, a feature its competitors offer. Similarly, in sports, we're seeing a shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles in pit crews. Will 2024 be the year we see a convergence of luxury and sustainability in both the automotive and sports worlds?
