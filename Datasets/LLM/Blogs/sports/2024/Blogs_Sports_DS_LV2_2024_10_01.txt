There’s something electric about a game like last night’s Heat-Jazz showdown. Watching Miami gut out that 126-120 win, I was reminded why I love this sport. It’s not just the box score stats; it’s the raw emotion, the sheer will to win in those final minutes. In a world that can feel so divided in 2024, the arena becomes a rare, unifying space where all that matters is the heart on the court. Pure magic.
