The final buzzer of my high school basketball career echoed in 2024, not with a championship roar, but with the quiet finality of a chapter closing. For weeks, a hollow feeling lingered where the squeak of sneakers and the thrill of a fast break used to be. I thought Iâ€™d lost a part of myself.

Then, on a lazy Sunday, I found myself shooting hoops alone at the local park. No clock, no pressure, just the rhythmic thud of the ball and the satisfying swish of a perfect shot. I wasn't playing for a trophy or a scoreboard anymore. I was playing for the pure, uncomplicated joy of it. In that moment, I realized the sport never leaves you; it just changes form, evolving from a competition into a lifelong companion.
