**The Thrill of the Guess: Why I’m Obsessed with Trivia Tuesday**

Okay, confession time: I’m a *huge* college football fan, but I’m also embarrassingly bad at remembering stats. That’s why I’ve fallen completely head over heels for those weekly “Trivia Tuesday” posts popping up on Reddit. Seriously, it’s become my guilty pleasure. 

It’s not just about the bragging rights (though, let’s be honest, there’s *some* satisfaction in being right!). There’s something really engaging about the challenge. You’ve got these questions, some ridiculously easy, others that make you frantically Google, and then the occasional curveball that just throws you for a loop. 

This year, with the Premier Tier teams battling for fall standings, it’s even more intense. It’s a fun way to dive back into the USC Championship Tier discussion, too! It’s a reminder that even as a fan, you can still learn and appreciate the details of the game.  It’s a little competition, a little knowledge, and a whole lot of fun – and that’s why I’ll be there, furiously typing, every Tuesday.
