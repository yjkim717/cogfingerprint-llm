**The Ghost of a Dream Job**

You know that feeling? That specific, almost obsessive, desire to build a footballing empire in Football Manager? I’ve been there, staring at the screen, meticulously crafting a career path for a brilliant, if slightly unassuming, Northern League manager. I’d built him up – tactical genius, incredible man-management skills, a knack for spotting young talent. 

Then came the appointment. A Premier League gig. And… it fell apart. The simulation just *didn’t* recognize his potential. It was a brutal, tiny disappointment, a reminder that even the most detailed game doesn’t capture the messy, unpredictable reality of a managerial career. 

It got me thinking about how frustrating it is when the game doesn’t reflect real-world progression, that missed opportunity to see a manager truly rise. It’s a perfect example of why, sometimes, the most rewarding part of Football Manager is simply the dreaming.
