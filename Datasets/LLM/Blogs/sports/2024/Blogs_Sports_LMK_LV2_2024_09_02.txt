As I watched the 2024 tennis tournament, I couldn't help but think about the unsung heroes behind the players' success - their trainers. Just like the BMW 7 Series, where the rear-seat entertainment is a hit with passengers, a good trainer is the behind-the-scenes luxury that makes a champion. They toil in the background, fine-tuning every serve and volley. It's a reminder that even in sports, sometimes it's the little luxuries that make all the difference. The 2024 tennis champs are a testament to the power of great training.
