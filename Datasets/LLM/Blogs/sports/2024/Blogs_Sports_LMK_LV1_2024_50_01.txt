As I watched the 2024 NBA finals, I couldn't help but think about the sports commentary assistants that have become a staple in our living rooms. While Apple's Siri has been a faithful companion to my iPhone, I've found myself increasingly frustrated with its limitations. Meanwhile, Google Assistant has been seamlessly controlling my Apple Home devices, including my ceiling fans, with ease. The contrast is stark. Just as a good sports commentator can elevate the game, a conversational AI like Google Assistant can elevate our daily interactions. It's time for Siri to step up its game, just like the athletes on the court.
