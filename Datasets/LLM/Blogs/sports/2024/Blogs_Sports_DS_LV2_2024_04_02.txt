It’s 2024, and I’m standing here with a Heisman-winning quarterback, open scholarships, and a transfer portal full of talent—yet I can’t get most receivers or tight ends to even look our way. It’s like showing up to a party with the best DJ and an open bar, but the dance floor stays empty.

You pour your heart into building a dynasty, only to find that some doors just won’t open, no matter how hard you knock. It’s humbling, frustrating, and a little surreal. But maybe that’s the lesson: in sports, as in life, you don’t always get to write the story you expect. You just keep showing up, ready for the next play.
