**The Ghosts of Offense Past: Why 2007 Still Matters**

It’s funny how certain years in sports just stick with you, right? For me, it’s 2007. Not because of a specific championship or a legendary player – though there were plenty of those – but because of something far more fascinating: the sheer *volume* of dominant offensive performances. 

I’ve been diving into some research lately, looking at FBS football and pinpointing what’s been dubbed “perfect offensive games” since then – 34 of them, as of 2023! It’s a rabbit hole of incredible stats, teams like the Baylor Bears in 2013 and the Clemson Tigers consistently tearing through defenses. 

What really struck me is how these games, these bursts of efficiency, felt like glimpses into a different era of football. It makes you wonder what’s changed. Are we seeing a return to the high-flying, relentlessly aggressive offenses of the past?  

Thinking about those drives, those points per play, it’s a reminder that football isn’t just about wins and losses; it’s about the artistry of the game itself. And honestly, revisiting those 2007 ghosts reminds me that some things – the sheer joy of a perfectly executed offensive play – never really go out of style.
