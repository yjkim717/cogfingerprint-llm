## The Echo of Tradition: More Than Just a Football Game

There’s something magical about a college football Saturday, isn’t there? But for me, it’s always been just as much about the music as the game itself. I was recently reminiscing about my favorite fight songs and alma maters – Iowa State’s stirring melody, Texas Tech’s powerful call, Oklahoma State’s… well, you get the picture! 

It's funny how a few bars of music can instantly transport you back to a specific time, a feeling, a memory. In 2024, with so much changing, those traditions feel even more precious, a link to something lasting. Anyone else feel that way?
