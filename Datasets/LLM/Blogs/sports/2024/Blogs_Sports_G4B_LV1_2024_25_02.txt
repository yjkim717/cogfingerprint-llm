**June’s a Big Goal: Garmin and My Tempo Push**

Okay, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for running – specifically, a half marathon in June! I’m seriously aiming for a 7:30 pace, and I’ve been leaning *hard* on Garmin’s daily workout suggestions.  It’s surprisingly motivating. 

Lately, I’ve been really focusing on incorporating tempo runs, guided by those suggested paces. It feels a little brutal at first, but I know it’s building the endurance I need. Plus, my coach training plans are feeding into this, layering in those speed sessions. Wish me luck – and maybe a little extra coffee! ☕️ #running #halfmarathon #garmin
