**The Quiet Disappointment of a Blowout**

Okay, let’s be honest. As a football fan – and I *love* football – there’s a part of me that just…resents the CFP semifinals this year. We’ve all seen it, right? The lopsided scores, the dominant performances. It’s become almost *expected* now. This year’s “semifinals” felt less like a thrilling playoff push and more like a pre-determined outcome. 

I remember watching the last play victory last week, and while it was exciting, it felt a little hollow.  It was a win, sure, but against a team that was simply outmatched. It’s a strange feeling, isn’t it?  You’re rooting for *any* kind of drama, any chance for a nail-biting finish, but the sport is trending toward these massive, almost predictable blowouts. 

I think it's changing the way we experience college football.  The ‘upset’ is becoming rarer, the stakes feel…lower. It's not that I don’t enjoy watching dominant teams play, but there’s something vital lost when a game is decided before halftime.  

Maybe it’s just nostalgia talking, a yearning for the days when every game felt like a potential upset.  But as we head into the College Football Playoff, I can’t help but wonder if we’re sacrificing the heart of the sport for the sake of a tidy, decisive championship.  What do you guys think?
