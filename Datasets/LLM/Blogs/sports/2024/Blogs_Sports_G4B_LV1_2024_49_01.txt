**The Championship Dream, and the Vanarama Reality**

It’s weird, isn’t it? You build something, you pour your heart into it, and suddenly it feels like everyone else is moving on to bigger and brighter things. Last year, I was convinced I was on the cusp of a Championship move. Southport was tearing up the National League, a proper force – we were *dominating*. I genuinely felt like I was building something special.

Then came the silence. Championship offers didn’t materialize. Now, I’m coaching in the Vanarama League North, and honestly? It's a shift. It’s humbling, definitely. But there’s a different kind of reward here, a sharper focus on the details.  Seeing the impact you have on a smaller squad, building a team from the ground up – it’s a reminder that success isn't always about the biggest stage.  QPR might be chasing headlines, but I’m chasing wins, one game at a time.
