**The Weight of the Team**

Okay, real talk. I just spent a frustrating week playing indoor soccer – and it hit me hard. We were *good*, technically. But the constant dropped passes, missed shots, and just plain miscommunication…it chipped away at my motivation. It’s easy to blame teammates, of course, but honestly, it’s a mirror reflecting my own frustration. 

This year, I’m trying to remember that teamwork isn’t just about individual skill; it’s about shared energy.  When one person’s down, the whole team feels it.  Maybe it’s time to focus less on the score and more on building that connection, even when things get tough.  Anyone else feel this way?
