As I watched 'Society of the Snow' on Netflix, I was struck by the harrowing true story of survival that unfolded on screen. Directed by Bayona, this international film tells the tale of a Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes in 1972. The film's visceral depiction of their struggle to stay alive is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience. What's remarkable is how this story, though centered around a tragic sports accident, transcends the world of sports to speak to our universal human experience. As we head into 2024, I'm reminded that the lessons of 'Society of the Snow' - about teamwork, perseverance, and the will to survive - are just as relevant to athletes and everyday people alike. This film is a powerful reminder that, even in the face of adversity, we can find the strength to overcome.
