There’s something powerful about a long-awaited moment—the kind that makes you hold your breath and remember why you love sports. For Michigan and Washington, the 2024 National Championship isn’t just a game; it’s the end of a shared drought. Think about it: both teams haven’t stood on this stage since 2010, and neither has lifted that trophy in over 25 years. That’s a generation of fans holding onto hope, of "maybe next year" turning into "finally, this year."

I can’t help but reflect on what it means to wait. It’s not just about the players on the field, but the communities behind them—the students, the alumni, the families who’ve passed down team pride like a family heirloom. There’s a beautiful tension in this matchup: two programs, each carrying the weight of expectation, yet both tasting this rarefied air for the first time in so long.

Tonight isn’t just about crowning a champion. It’s about resilience, legacy, and the sweet relief when patience finally pays off. Let’s savor it.
