## The Unexpected Silence and the Lesson Learned on the Field

Okay, so I had a *weird* week. It wasn’t a dramatic injury or a game-losing fumble, but it was a frustrating tech snafu that really mirrored the feeling of being off your game. I’m a huge baseball fan, and I've been trying to follow spring training closely through live streams and practice audio. But something was seriously wrong – tracks panned left in the audio sounded in both speakers, while anything panned right just… vanished.

Sound familiar to anyone else wrestling with audio quirks? It drove me crazy! After hours of troubleshooting, thinking it was a Logic Pro glitch, I traced it back to the most unlikely culprit: my AirPods. Apparently, the input levels had somehow maxed out. 

It felt like a silly revelation, but it got me thinking. Sometimes, the biggest roadblocks aren't the complex problems we anticipate, but the tiny, overlooked details. Just like a pitcher needs to focus on every pitch, not just the big moments, we need to pay attention to *everything* to stay on track. Now, back to enjoying the games – and keeping those AirPods levels in check!
