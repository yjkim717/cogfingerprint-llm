    return f"""As we step into {year}, the world is buzzing with excitement, and sports fans are eagerly waiting for the biggest events to unfold. The debate that has been ongoing for years is - which is more prestigious for a host country, the Olympics or the FIFA World Cup?

Hosting either of these events is a monumental task. It requires a massive amount of resources, infrastructure development, and a country's pride is on the line. The Olympics, with its diverse range of sports, brings together athletes from around the globe, promoting unity and healthy competition. On the other hand, the FIFA World Cup is the most-watched sporting event, with an unparalleled global viewership.

Let's take a closer look. The Olympics have a broader appeal, with a wide range of sports that cater to different interests. The FIFA World Cup, however, is a different story altogether. It's an event that transcends borders, cultures, and languages, with the beautiful game being the universal language.

So, which one is more prestigious? It's a tough call. While the Olympics bring a certain level of prestige with its diverse sporting events, the FIFA World Cup's global viewership is hard to match. Perhaps the true prestige lies not in the event itself, but in the ability of the host country to stage it successfully, showcasing its infrastructure, culture, and hospitality to the world.

In the end, it's not about which event is more prestigious; it's about the pride, the excitement, and the unity that comes with hosting these global sports events."""
