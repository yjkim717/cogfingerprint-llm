**Trivia Tuesday: A Love Letter to College Football**

As the crisp autumn air sets in, the 2024 college football season is in full swing, and the /r/CFB community is buzzing with excitement. Every Tuesday, fans gather to test their knowledge and passion for the sport in a weekly trivia contest. It's more than just a quiz – it's a celebration of the game we love.

I still remember the thrill of my first Trivia Tuesday. The questions were tough, but the camaraderie was palpable. Fellow fans from all over the country came together, sharing their expertise and enthusiasm. As we discussed the finer points of SEC football and debated the merits of various coaching legends, I felt a deep connection to the community.

This year's Fall Standings have been a wild ride, with Premier Tier teams battling it out for supremacy. The questions in Trivia Tuesday have kept pace, challenging us to dig deep into our knowledge of college football history. From obscure bowl game records to the intricacies of recruiting, every topic is fair game.

As I look back on the past season, I'm struck by the ways in which Trivia Tuesday has become a highlight of my week. It's not just about the competition – it's about the shared experience of being part of a community that lives and breathes college football. So, if you're a fellow fan looking for a fun way to engage with the sport, I encourage you to join us. Let's see who's the ultimate CFB trivia champion of 2024!
