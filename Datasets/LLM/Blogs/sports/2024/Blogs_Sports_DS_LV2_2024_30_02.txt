There’s something about the final buzzer in 2024 that still gets me. It’s not just the scoreboard; it’s the echo of the first whistle, a reprise of all the hope and hustle from months before. I think of those aging veterans, one last playoff push etched on their faces, and it hits me. We’re all just trying to build something that lasts, a legacy that echoes long after the crowd has gone home. It’s the ultimate season, and we’re all playing.
