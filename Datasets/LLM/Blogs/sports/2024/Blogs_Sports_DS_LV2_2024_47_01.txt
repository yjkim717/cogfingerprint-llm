The final buzzer of my last high school game still echoes in my mind. It was 2024, and I was in the post, trying to back down a defender who was all elbows and brute force. I kept pushing, getting nowhere, frustration mounting.

Then, my coach’s voice cut through the noise: “Stop forcing it. Use their aggression against them.”

That was the lesson. Instead of meeting force with force, I learned to pivot, to use a quick drop-step or a gentle fadeaway. Their strength became my leverage. It’s a principle that’s stuck with me far beyond the court—sometimes, the smartest move isn’t to push harder, but to pivot and find a new angle. It’s not about backing down; it’s about stepping into a smarter play.
