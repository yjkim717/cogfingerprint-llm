**Streaming Blues & the Nostalgia of Cable**

Seriously, my tech is driving me nuts lately. I just upgraded my entire home network – new router, faster internet – and my Xumo box *still* throws connection errors during big games. It’s infuriating! I was so excited about the streaming possibilities, but it feels like a constant battle. 

Honestly, I’m starting to crave the old days. Remember those cable boxes? Sure, they had their quirks, but at least you *knew* you’d get a reliable signal for the Super Bowl. There’s something comforting about that stability. 

I'm seriously considering asking Spectrum for a traditional box. Maybe a little bit of buffering-free football is worth the price of admission. What about you guys - are you battling streaming woes too?
