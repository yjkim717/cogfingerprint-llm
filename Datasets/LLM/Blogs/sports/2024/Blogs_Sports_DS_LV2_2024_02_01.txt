The final buzzer of my high school basketball career echoed in 2024, a sound more definitive than any scoreboard. For years, my identity was tied to that polished court—the sweat, the plays, the roar. Stepping away felt like a freefall. Who was I without the jersey? But slowly, I’ve found a new rhythm in early morning runs, the simple joy of movement for me. The competition hasn't vanished; it’s just shifted inward. It turns out, the greatest victory was learning to play a different game.
