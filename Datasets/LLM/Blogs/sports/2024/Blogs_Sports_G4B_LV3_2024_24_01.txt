**The Tech That Just Didn’t Click**

Anyone else trying to keep up with all the streaming gadgets? I was really excited about the Xumo box – touted as a simple way to watch sports and catch up on shows. I even invested in the Spectrum app to pair it with. But honestly? It was a frustrating mess. Constant connection errors, buffering nightmares… it felt like I was wasting my time and my money.

I’d hoped for a seamless experience, especially during the big games. Instead, I ended up longing for the familiar reliability of a good old-fashioned cable box. It’s funny how technology promises so much, and sometimes, the simplest solution is actually the best.  Maybe I’ll stick with what works, and leave the latest gadgets for another day. What about you – have you had a similar tech disappointment lately?
