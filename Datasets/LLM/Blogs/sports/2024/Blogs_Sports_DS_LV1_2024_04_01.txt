You know, it’s funny how narratives stick in sports. I was thinking back to 2024, when Charles Barkley claimed the Lakers only sniffed the playoffs because of the play-in tournament. It’s a spicy take, for sure—the kind that gets clicks and stirs up talk shows.

But here’s the thing: when you actually look at the standings from those recent seasons, the math just doesn’t back it up. More often than not, the Lakers were already securely in the playoff picture before the play-in even became a factor. The tournament didn’t hand them a ticket; it just added drama to a race they were already running.

It’s a good reminder that in sports—and in life—we sometimes latch onto simple stories instead of digging into the details. The play-in didn’t create the Lakers’ success; it just gave us one more reason to watch. And honestly, isn’t that what makes sports so compelling?
