**That Familiar Chord – Remembering the Game’s Heartbeat**

It’s funny how a single musical phrase can instantly transport you back. Last weekend, watching the Eagles’ comeback against the Ravens, I kept hearing that snippet from the intro to *Bohemian Rhapsody* – the part with the choir. It’s a reprise, really, a little musical echo of that iconic moment. 

Suddenly, I wasn’t just watching a football game; I was back at the cinema, feeling that surge of emotion all over again. Music history, in a way, just *showed up* on the sidelines. It’s a reminder that powerful stories, whether on a screen or a field, are often amplified by the right soundtrack.
