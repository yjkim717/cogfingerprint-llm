"My Summer of Gridiron Revival"

As I stepped onto the gridiron in the summer of 2024, the smell of freshly cut grass and the sound of helmets crashing brought back memories of my glory days on the field. My kid's pee-wee football team needed a coach, and I couldn't resist the chance to relive my athletic past. As we practiced under the sweltering sun, I realized that the lessons I learned on the field – teamwork, perseverance, and grit – were just as relevant to life off the field. Coaching wasn't just about winning; it was about building character.
