## The Ghost of the Starting Line

It’s weird, isn't it? How a memory can suddenly feel…faded. Like a photo bleached by the sun. I was thinking about my high school track days – specifically, that regional meet in 2012. We were *sure* we were going to states. We’d trained so hard. But then, during the 4x800 relay, something just…shifted. My legs felt heavy, my mind blank. I couldn’t even remember the handoff signal. 

It wasn’t an injury. No one said anything. It was just…gone. Looking back, it feels almost supernatural, like the pressure somehow stole my brainpower. Now, years later, I wonder if everyone experiences something similar, a little mental fade when the stakes are highest. Maybe it’s the fear, maybe it's the weight of expectation. It’s a strange, lingering ghost on the starting line of memory.
