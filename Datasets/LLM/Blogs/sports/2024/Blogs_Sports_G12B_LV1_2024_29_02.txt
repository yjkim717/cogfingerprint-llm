## The Quiet Joy of Watching, Not Playing

It’s funny, isn’t it? How much we focus on *doing* in sports. The training, the competition, the relentless pursuit of improvement. But lately, in 2024, I've found a different kind of satisfaction – simply watching. 

My knee’s been giving me grief, so my days of pounding the pavement are on pause. Instead, I've been glued to the TV, especially the local high school games. There's a pure, unadulterated joy in seeing those young athletes give it their all, without the pressure I used to put on myself. 

It’s a reminder that sports aren't just about winning or personal bests. They're about camaraderie, passion, and that feeling of shared excitement. And sometimes, the best way to appreciate that is from the sidelines.
