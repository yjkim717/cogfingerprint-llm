It’s 2024, and as I scroll through the latest AP Top 25, I’m reminded that a team’s record only tells part of the story. What truly defines a season is the strength in the struggle—the grit it takes to face down a top-ten opponent week after week.

Looking at the Massey Composite and opponent rankings, I see programs like Georgia and Oregon. Their near-perfect records aren’t built on easy wins, but on battles against the best. It makes me reflect: in life, as in college football, our toughest challenges often forge our most meaningful victories. It’s not just about how many you win, but who you had to beat to get there.
