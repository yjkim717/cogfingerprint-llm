As I hit the gym in 2024, I realized tracking my macros was key to my fitness goals. I'm on the hunt for a calorie tracker without a subscription fee. MyFitnessPal's limitations led me to explore alternatives like MyNetDiary. A reliable calorie counter can make or break my weight loss journey. I'm testing different apps to find the perfect fit - will I stick with a familiar favorite or discover a new champion?
