**That Overtime Feeling**

Anyone else get that weird knot in their stomach during overtime? I was just thinking about Michigan’s history – and it’s… complicated. They’ve pulled off some incredible wins against tough BCS teams, these moments where everything hinges on a single play. It’s a reminder that college football isn’t always about pretty stats; it’s about grit, about those nail-biting seconds.  Seeing those OT victories, like the ones against Alabama, just solidifies that feeling – a mix of relief and pure adrenaline.  What's *your* most memorable overtime moment? #MichiganFootball #CollegeFootball #OTWins
