**The Ghosts in the Stands**

Anyone else ever have that weird feeling watching a game? Like, you glance up and think, “Wait, is *that* someone in the box seats?” It got me thinking about the players we all idolize – LeBron, Booker, even the guys on the Jazz – and how their partners probably see them, not as superhuman athletes, but as… well, just *them*.
