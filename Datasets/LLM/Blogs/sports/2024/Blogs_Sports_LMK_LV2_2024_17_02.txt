"As I stepped onto the court in 2024, I couldn't help but think of my grandfather, who taught me to play basketball. Now, as I coach my own kids, I'm reminded of the lessons he instilled in me - perseverance, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Watching them grow and improve is a thrill, and I'm grateful for the bond we share through sports. The court is more than just a playing field - it's a legacy of love and connection."
