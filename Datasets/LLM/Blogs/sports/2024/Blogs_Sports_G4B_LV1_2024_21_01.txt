**The Internet Knows Best? Diving into the Final College Football Poll**

Okay, let's be honest, we all do it. We obsess over sports rankings. Every week, ESPN, CBS, and countless others release their predictions, and we pore over them, arguing with our friends about who *really* deserves to be number one. This year, though, something a little different happened – and it’s a reminder that sometimes, the crowd knows best.

I was scrolling through Reddit last night, and I stumbled across the final /r/CFB poll for the 2023 college football season.  It's a surprisingly fascinating ritual.  They let everyone – *everyone* – cast their vote for the final Top 25.  And the results?  Honestly, it threw me for a loop. 

Several teams that had been consistently lauded by the "experts" were surprisingly lower in the Reddit rankings.  It made me think about how much influence social media and opinion can have on our perception of a sport.  Is it just a bunch of passionate fans yelling into the void, or is there something genuinely insightful about aggregating everyone's thoughts? 

It’s a good reminder that while professional analysts have their expertise, the collective wisdom of a dedicated fanbase can offer a different, and sometimes more accurate, perspective.  Plus, it just makes checking the poll a little more fun, right?  What do *you* think – did the Reddit poll get it right?
