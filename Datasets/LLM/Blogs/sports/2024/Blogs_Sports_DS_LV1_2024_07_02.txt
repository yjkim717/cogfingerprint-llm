That brutal 0-5 run in Trials last night had me ready to hang up my virtual boots for good. My shots were off, my teammates were frustrated, and every round felt like a slow-motion collapse. But then I remembered my old high school coachâ€™s words: "A slump is just data, not destiny." Maybe tomorrow's reset isn't about winning, but about learning from the loss.
