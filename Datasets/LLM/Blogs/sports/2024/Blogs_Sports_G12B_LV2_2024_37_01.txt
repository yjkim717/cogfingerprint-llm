## The Rivalry Runs Deep: Remembering Clemson-Carolina Baseball

There's something different about a rivalry. It's more than just wins and losses; it's the echoes of past games, the shared memories, the bragging rights that last all year. This weekend, the South Carolina vs. Clemson baseball series is back, and it hits a little different, doesn't it? 

I remember being a kid, glued to the TV, watching these games with my dad. The tension, the drama… it was electric. Knowing the probable starting pitchers adds another layer of anticipation. It’s a testament to how far college baseball has come, these matchups are always a highlight of the NCAA season. Hoping for a good series, and hoping for some memories to make this year!
