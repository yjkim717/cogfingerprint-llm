The roar of the stadium is a distant memory now, replaced by the quiet hum of my phone. In 2024, my sports fandom looks less like face paint and more like scrolling through endless highlight clips and hot takes.

I miss the shared, singular experience—the collective gasp, the high-fives with strangers. Now, the game is fractured into a million digital pieces, consumed in isolation. It’s convenient, sure, but it feels… thinner. The algorithm shows me what it thinks I want, not the raw, unpredictable narrative that unfolds in real time.

I’m starting to believe the most important play isn't on the field, but in choosing to put the screen down and just be present in the moment again. The real victory is reclaiming that feeling.
