**The Big 12’s Shifting Sands – And a Little Bit of Worry**

Man, Week 9 in the Big 12 felt…weird. You could practically *taste* the bowl game possibilities hanging in the air, right? But then Oklahoma State’s loss? That completely threw a wrench in any title dreams. It’s a brutal reminder of how quickly things can change in college football.
