**The Wall and the Weight of It All**

Anyone else feel like sometimes the game just *closes in*? I was battling a seriously aggressive post defender last week – a real wall of arms and elbows. He was backing me down relentlessly, forcing me to take tough, contested shots. Honestly, it was frustrating. 

I started thinking about leverage, about not just battling *with* him, but *using* his strength against him.  A quick step back, a subtle shift of weight, and suddenly he was off balance. We ended up with a couple of free throws, a small victory.  It reminded me that sometimes, the smartest play isn’t always the flashiest – it’s about recognizing the pressure and finding a way to back down with control.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focus on a specific aspect or change the tone?
