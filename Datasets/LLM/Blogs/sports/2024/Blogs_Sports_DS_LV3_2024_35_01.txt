The air crackles with anticipation tonight at the 2024 Olympic Trials. As the men line up for the 110m hurdles semifinals, I’m reminded that this isn't just about speed. It’s about rhythm, precision, and the courage to leap without hesitation. Each athlete has a story of sacrifice leading to this moment. Watching them, I think about the hurdles in my own life—those challenges that demand we gather our strength and simply fly. It’s a powerful reminder that we are all running our own races.
