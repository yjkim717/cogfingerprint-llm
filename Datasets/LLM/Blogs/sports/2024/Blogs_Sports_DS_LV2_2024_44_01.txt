It’s 2024, and I still think about those tennis suspensions—the ones blamed on “contaminated supplements” or mysterious SARMS. As a fan, it’s tough. You cheer for these athletes, invest in their journeys, then feel that sting of disappointment. It makes you wonder: in a sport built on raw skill and relentless grit, why risk it all? I guess it’s a reminder that the pressure to perform can cloud even the clearest judgment. What a heavy price for a moment of glory.
