It’s 2024, and I can’t help but think about how the NBA landscape has shifted. Remember when max contracts felt like lifetime achievement awards? Now, with the new CBA, every dollar counts—and it’s forcing teams to ask tough questions. Is that star really worth it if they can’t defend or stay healthy? I miss the days of loyalty, but maybe this push for durable, two-way players is what the game needed. It’s a bittersweet evolution, balancing heart and hard numbers.
