It’s 2024, and I’ve spent another winter watching Gophers basketball with a familiar sense of frustration. The numbers don’t lie—the 3-point percentage is anemic, and the free throw shooting is just painful. But it’s more than stats; it’s the *way* they play. There’s no fluidity, no instinct. It feels like a team running on nil resources, not in terms of talent, but in coaching fundamentals.

You can see it in the hesitant passes and the confused defensive rotations. The basketball IQ just isn't developing. It’s heartbreaking because these players deserve a system that teaches, inspires, and builds. Right now, they look lost. I keep asking myself: is this the best we can offer them? For the sake of the team's future, I think it might be time for a change at the top. Someone has to bring back the love for the game’s basics.
