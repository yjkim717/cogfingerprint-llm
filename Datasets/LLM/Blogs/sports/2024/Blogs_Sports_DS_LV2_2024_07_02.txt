That brutal losing streak in rec league basketball last night stung. Missed passes, defensive lapsesâ€”it felt hopeless. But driving home, I realized something. Those frustrating games with random teammates aren't just about the final score. They're the grind that forges resilience. You learn to adapt, to find small victories in a single good play. That's the growth that truly matters, win or lose.
