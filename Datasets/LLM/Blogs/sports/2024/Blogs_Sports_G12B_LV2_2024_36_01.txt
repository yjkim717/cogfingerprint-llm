## The Heat and My (Bad) Betting Habits

Okay, I need to admit something. I’ve been doing a *lot* of over/under betting on the Miami Heat this season. Like, a concerning amount. I *know* it’s probably not the smartest move – their scoring can be so unpredictable! Yet, here I am, placing those bets, hoping for a buzzer-beater that pushes them over. It's a frustrating cycle. Anyone else fall into the trap of betting on your favorite team, even when logic screams “don’t”? Maybe this year I'll finally break the habit... or maybe not.
