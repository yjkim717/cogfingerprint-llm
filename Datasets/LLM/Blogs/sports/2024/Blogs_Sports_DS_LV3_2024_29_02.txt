The rhythmic splash of my morning swims has become my meditation. In 2024, where digital noise is constant, the pool is my sanctuary. It’s not about competition or speed; it’s the simple, repetitive motion that clears my head. Each lap washes away the stress, leaving only the sound of my breath and the water’s embrace. This quiet, personal sport has taught me that sometimes the most profound victories are found in stillness, not in the race. It’s my moving meditation.
