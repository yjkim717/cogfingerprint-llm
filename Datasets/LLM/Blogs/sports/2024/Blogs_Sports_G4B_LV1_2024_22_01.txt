**The Echo in the Stands**

It’s weird, right? Being at a baseball game and suddenly feeling… overwhelmed.  This summer, my son Leo, who has ASD, had his first real experience watching a game. He was thrilled, clutching his headphones, until he heard a little kid nearby bursting into tears.  His reaction was explosive – a full-blown meltdown. It hit me hard – the way his sensory world can be so easily triggered.  It made me realize how much we athletes sometimes miss – the quiet struggles happening just beneath the surface.
