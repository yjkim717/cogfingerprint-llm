It’s wild watching Anthony Edwards this season. The Timberwolves' defense is *really* stacking the paint, and Rudy Gobert and Jarred Vanderbilt are doing a phenomenal job of rim protection against Gafford and Lively. I’m starting to worry about Edwards – he’s still that explosive jumper, but those extra layers of pressure are forcing him to work so much harder for every point. It feels like a crucial element for the Wolves’ success will be how consistently he can get to the basket.  What do you think?
