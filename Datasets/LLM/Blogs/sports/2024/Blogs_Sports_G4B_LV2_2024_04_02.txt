**Dynasty Dreams, Portal Nightmares**

Okay, folks, let me tell you – 2024 college football dynasty mode is *not* cooperating. I’ve poured hours into building my program, scouting the transfer portal like a hawk, and… nothing. Seriously, the transfer portal feels like a glitching black hole. I’m trying to snag some top talent, but it's like they just vanish when I click “recruit.” 

It’s incredibly frustrating when a game mode you’re invested in throws you curveballs like this. It makes you question everything! Are the recruitment mechanics broken? Am I missing something obvious?  It’s a reminder that even in the digital world of sports, there’s still a learning curve – and a whole lot of patience required.  Anyone else battling this beast?
