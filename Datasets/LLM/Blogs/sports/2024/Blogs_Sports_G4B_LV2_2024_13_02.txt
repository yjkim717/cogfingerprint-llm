**The Silent Start – Lessons from a Broken Mower**

You know those moments when you just *know* something’s wrong? I had one this weekend, staring at my Ranch King riding mower. It wouldn’t even *try* to crank, even with a fresh battery and a working ignition switch. It felt… frustrating, like a silent challenge. 

It took some digging – turns out a simple wiring problem – but it really got me thinking about sports. Sometimes, you’ve got the right equipment, the right strategy, but something’s just not connecting. It’s like a missed shot or a dropped pass. 

Just like troubleshooting that mower, you have to systematically check the basics.  It’s a reminder that even the most powerful things need careful attention to detail.  Maybe this weekend, I’ll focus on the fundamentals, just like I do on the field.
