**The Knight That Wouldn’t Let Go**

Anyone who’s ever gotten seriously stuck in a game – whether it’s chess, a video game, or even a tricky conversation – knows that feeling. It’s that slow burn of frustration, where you *know* there’s a way out, but you just can't quite see it. 

Recently, I was battling a mini-game, a surprisingly intense chess variant, and I was absolutely dominated by this relentless knight. Seriously, it felt like it was everywhere at once! I kept trying different strategies, hoping for a pawn promotion miracle, but nothing worked. 

It wasn't about winning or losing; it was about that stubborn refusal to give up.  Eventually, I just stepped back, took a breath, and started fresh. Sometimes, the best strategy is simply a fresh perspective.  What’s your go-to move when you’re stuck in a rut?
