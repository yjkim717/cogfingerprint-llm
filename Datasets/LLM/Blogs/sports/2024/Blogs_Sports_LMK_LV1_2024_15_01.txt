"Court Time Chaos: A Surprising Start to the 2024 NBA Season"

As I settled into my courtside seat for the Lakers' season opener, I was expecting the usual pre-game hype. But nothing could've prepared me for the unexpected delay - or lack thereof. The intro video was cut short, and the teams were on the court before the ads finished rolling. The game tipped off a good 10 minutes early, catching everyone off guard. I was left scrambling to grab a snack from the concession stand, now closed due to the early start. Guess that's one way to kick off the 2024 NBA season - with a bang, and a bit of chaos.
