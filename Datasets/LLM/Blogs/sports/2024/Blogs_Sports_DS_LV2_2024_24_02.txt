There I was on the 15th fairway in 2024, my 7-iron feeling like a stranger in my hands. My wedges? Pure poetry. But the gap to my long irons felt like a canyon. I’d groove my tempo, hear that sweet ‘click’ of perfect contact, and watch the ball fall woefully short. As a self-taught golfer, this puzzle is my white whale. It’s a humbling reminder that in this game, some distances aren’t measured in yards, but in patience.
