**The Sound of a Shift**

It’s funny how certain things just… change, isn’t it? Like, you’re comfortable in a routine, and then suddenly you realize you’re staring at it with a slightly different perspective. That’s how I’ve been feeling lately, and it’s oddly connected to my old basketball days.

I spent years on the court, a point guard obsessed with finding *the* shot, *the* rhythm. My whole game was built around repetition, perfecting my dribble, anticipating passes. But this season, something felt off. I wasn’t reacting instinctively; I was overthinking. 

It was like I'd built a solid system – a good amp and cabinet for my game – but hadn’t really considered *how* I wanted the sound to be. I was so focused on the mechanics that I’d lost touch with the feeling. 

I started experimenting, trusting my gut more, letting go of the need for absolute precision. It wasn't about being perfect; it was about finding the flow. 

Just like that bassist upgrading their setup, I realized I needed to shift my approach. Sometimes, the best upgrades aren’t about buying new gear, but about fundamentally changing how you play – how you *listen* to yourself. 

What’s one area of your life where you've needed to adjust your 'sound' this year?
