## The Anticipation is Real: Planning My Italian Football Pilgrimage

Okay, confession time: I’m already dreaming of October 2024. Not for the crisp autumn air, though that’s a definite bonus, but for the chance to finally witness a Serie A match in Italy! I've been following Italian football for years, and the atmosphere must be electric. 

The only snag? Timing. I need to know when the 2024/2025 schedule drops. It feels silly, obsessing over dates this far out, but this trip is more than just a vacation – it’s a pilgrimage for a long-time fan. Anyone have a clue when the Serie A schedule will be released? Let’s hope it’s soon so I can start planning!
