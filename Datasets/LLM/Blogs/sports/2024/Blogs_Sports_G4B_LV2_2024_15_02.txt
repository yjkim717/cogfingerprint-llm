**Lost in the Andes – And Found in the Screen**

Okay, let’s be honest, sometimes you just need a good, gut-punch of a story. Lately, I’ve been completely absorbed in ‘Society of the Snow’ on Netflix, and it’s stuck with me in a way few films do. 

It’s not just the stunning cinematography – seriously, those Andean landscapes are breathtaking – but the sheer *weight* of the narrative. Remembering the Uruguayan rugby team’s doomed flight and their desperate fight for survival is incredibly sobering. 

What really got me, though, was the detail. The way the film meticulously portrays the makeup and hairstyling of the survivors, a small but incredibly poignant detail, really hammered home the resilience of the human spirit. 

It reminded me of my own love for sports – the dedication, the teamwork, the moments of both incredible triumph and devastating loss. ‘Society of the Snow’ isn’t just a thrilling drama; it’s a reminder of what truly matters. Have you seen it?
