It’s 2024, and my son just turned ten. Like so many kids his age, he lives in a world of digital everything—streaming, gaming, and endless online adventures. So when it came time for a console upgrade, the choice felt bigger than just picking a device.

I kept hearing about the Xbox Series S, especially with those tempting Black Friday deals making it so accessible. But was it future-proof? Would it hold up as he grows? Then it hit me: his gaming habits are almost entirely digital. No stacks of discs, just instant downloads and Game Pass. The Series S isn’t just a console—it’s a doorway to how he already connects with friends and explores new worlds.

Choosing it wasn’t just a practical decision; it felt like meeting him where he is. In a few years, he’ll want something more powerful, sure. But for now, it’s perfect. And honestly, watching him dive into those digital realms reminds me of my own childhood, trading baseball cards in the park—only his park has no borders.
