As I belt out my alma mater's fight song at college football games, I'm reminded of the electric atmosphere that unites fans. The NCAA has always known how to cultivate school spirit, and it's contagious. From "Rocky Top" to "The Victors," iconic fight songs evoke nostalgia and pride. What's your go-to college fight song, and which alma mater do you cheer for the loudest?
