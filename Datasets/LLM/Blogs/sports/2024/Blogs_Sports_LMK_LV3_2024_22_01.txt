As I watched my 4-year-old ASD child struggle to cope with the sound of other kids crying on the playground in 2024, I realized that just like in sports, life requires strategies to tackle tough situations. When my child's sensory limits are pushed, they lash out, much like a team under pressure. Teaching them coping mechanisms is like coaching a team to work together - it takes patience, practice, and understanding to score a win.
