The final buzzer echoed, a sound I’d heard a thousand times, but this one was different. 2024 was supposed to be my year, the culmination of a decade of pre-dawn training sessions and worn-out sneakers.

It wasn't a physical failure; it was a complete mental shutdown, a sudden and total loss of the instinct I’d built my life around. Sometimes, the biggest competition isn't against the other team, but the one happening inside your own head.
