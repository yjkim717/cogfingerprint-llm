**The Ghosts of Close Games**

There’s something about a loss that just sticks with you, doesn’t there? Last night’s Hornets vs. 76ers game – 114-121 – it wasn’t just a score on the board; it felt like a missed opportunity, a lingering sense of “what if?”  I spent the evening obsessing over the box score, replaying every possession, every contested shot. 

You know that feeling? When you watch a game and the energy is electric, the crowd is roaring, and your team is *this* close, only to see it slip away in the final minutes. It’s a frustrating kind of excitement, a bittersweet cocktail of disappointment and admiration for the other team. 

Looking at the team stats – Charlotte’s shooting percentage, the 76ers’ dominant rebounding – it’s easy to get bogged down in the numbers. But honestly, those cold, hard facts don't really capture the heart of it. It’s about those individual battles, the flashes of brilliance, and the moments where a single turnover changed everything. 

I think sports, at its core, is a fantastic mirror reflecting our own lives. We all have games where we’re leading, where we feel we’ve got it in the bag, and then suddenly, a shift, a mistake, and it’s all gone. It’s a reminder that resilience and learning from those close calls are just as important as winning. 

What’s your go-to post-game reflection? Do you dissect the strategy, or just let the feeling wash over you?
