"Coaching a team to victory in 2024 means adapting to the modern game. We struggled to defend against the 5-out offense in man-to-man defense, particularly with positioning our big man. We wanted to keep him near the block for rim protection, but that left their shooter open beyond the arc. It was a tough balancing act. Through trial and error, we adjusted our defensive strategy to account for the opponent's versatility. By doing so, we improved our overall defense and gained a competitive edge. It was a valuable lesson in the importance of flexibility in coaching."
