**The Unfinished Game**

You know those moments in sports – a game you *felt* you were going to win, but something just… slipped away? That’s how I felt watching my high school team last fall. We were dominating, leading by ten with five minutes left, and the energy was electric. 

Then, a missed shot, a quick turnover, and suddenly it was a nail-biter. We lost by three. It wasn’t just the loss itself, though. It was the feeling of having built something great, only to have it crumble at the last second. 

It made me think about life, really. We all have plans, projects – like a perfect patio installation gone wrong – that we’re pouring our energy into. Sometimes, things don't go as expected and we need to figure out how to level things out and start again.  It’s a tough lesson, but a valuable one.  Just like a sport, sometimes the game isn’t about winning, but about how you respond to the final whistle.
