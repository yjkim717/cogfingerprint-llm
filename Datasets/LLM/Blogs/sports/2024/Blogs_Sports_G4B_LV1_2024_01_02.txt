**The Grit in the Gravel: Remembering My First Race**

It’s weird how certain moments just stick with you, right?  I was just thinking about my first mountain bike race back in 2022 – a muddy, chaotic mess of gravel and teenage nerves. I was 10, just like my son is now, and terrified.  I'd spent months building up to it, obsessing over my bike, and then… the starting gun.

Honestly, I spent most of the race trying *not* to crash.  I was last, swallowed by a pack of older, more confident riders. But something happened – a stubborn refusal to give up.  I just kept putting one pedal in front of the other, battling the terrain, and the other racers. 

I didn't win, of course.  But crossing that finish line, covered in mud and grinning like a fool, was a huge victory. It wasn’t about speed or skill; it was about pushing past the fear and proving to myself I could do it.  It’s a lesson I think every kid (and honestly, every adult) needs to learn.  What’s *your* first race memory?
