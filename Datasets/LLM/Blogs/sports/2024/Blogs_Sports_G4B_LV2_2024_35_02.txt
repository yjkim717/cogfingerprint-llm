**The Buzz of the Trials – Remembering the Feeling**

It’s hard to believe the 2024 US Olympic Trials are almost here! Just thinking about it brings back a flood of memories – specifically, watching my younger cousin absolutely *lose it* during the steeplechase final last time. The raw emotion, the nail-biting tension... it’s a feeling you don’t easily forget. 

This year, I’m particularly excited about the women’s discus throw. There are some incredible athletes vying for a spot, and I’m genuinely rooting for everyone. It’s amazing to see the dedication and sheer power it takes to compete at that level. 

Honestly, the Trials aren't just about the gold medals. They're about the stories – the triumphs, the heartbreaks, and the unwavering spirit of competition.  I’m already planning my viewing party – who’s with me?! #USOlympicTrials #TrackAndField #2024Trials
