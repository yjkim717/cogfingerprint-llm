As we hit Week 15 of the 2024 NFL season, I’m struck by how much these power rankings mirror life. Every team has its average rank—the story we tell the world—but it’s the standard deviation that reveals the real drama. Are they steady, or a rollercoaster of highs and lows? It’s a reminder that beneath the surface stats, there’s always uncertainty, potential, and the thrill of what’s next. Just like our own journeys, the rankings are never set in stone.
