It’s 2024, and the new CBA is reshaping how we see value in the league. I used to think max contracts were reserved for flashy scorers, but now? Durability and two-way impact are everything. Watching MPJ trade talks swirl, it’s clear: teams can’t afford to overpay for one-way or injury-prone stars anymore. The game’s evolving, and so is our definition of a franchise player—versatility and reliability are the new currency. It’s a refreshing, if sobering, shift for us fans.
