**My "No-Swing" Softball Season**

You know that moment in a game where instinct takes over? For me, it was always swinging for the fences. But this past 2024 season, I gave myself a challenge: no swinging. Not a single at-bat. My only job was to get on base with walks.

My teammates thought I’d lost it. The first few games were brutal—strikeout after strikeout, fighting every muscle memory screaming at me to hit. But slowly, something shifted. I started seeing the ball differently, reading the pitcher’s tells, and embracing a strange, new patience.

I didn't break any home run records, but I led our rec league in walks. More importantly, I learned that sometimes the most powerful move isn't a show of force, but disciplined restraint. It completely changed how I see competition, and honestly, how I approach pressure off the field, too. Who knew not doing anything could be so hard, and so rewarding?
