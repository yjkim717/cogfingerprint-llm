The puzzling world of Football Manager managerial appointments. I've lost count of how many times I've been snubbed for a top job despite achieving success in the lower leagues. The latest slight was being overlooked for a Championship role, despite having just led a team to promotion from League Two. It's frustrating to see less accomplished managers get the nod, while I'm left wondering what else I need to do to get recognized. In the virtual world of Football Manager 2024, it's a familiar tale. The game's algorithms often seem to prioritize factors other than actual managerial merit. As a virtual gaffer, it's disheartening to be judged on something other than results. Still, I'm not giving up â€“ I'll keep racking up the wins and hoping that one day, my efforts will be rewarded with a top-tier appointment.
