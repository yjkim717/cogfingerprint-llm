## Finding the Beauty in Limitation: My Unexpected Love for the Assist

Okay, so I've been completely consumed by *Slay the Spire* lately, which might seem random, but hear me out. I just finished a crazy challenge – a “no-attack” run with the Defect character, trying to climb the Ascension levels purely through orbs and blocking. It was brutal, frustrating, and ultimately… incredibly rewarding. 

It reminded me a lot of watching a basketball game where a player *always* passes, rarely taking a shot themselves. Initially, you might think, "Why aren't they shooting?!" But then you see the beautiful plays unfold, the assists leading to points, the teamwork blossoming. 

This year, I’m trying to apply that same mindset to my own life. Finding joy not just in scoring my own goals, but in setting up others for theirs. It’s a different kind of victory, and surprisingly, it feels pretty good.
