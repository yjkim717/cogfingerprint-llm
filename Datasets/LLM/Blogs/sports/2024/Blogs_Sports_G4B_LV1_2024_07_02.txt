**The Silent Game**

Ugh, last week’s game felt…off. We were down, and honestly, it felt like my teammates just weren’t *there*. It’s a brutal feeling, watching your efforts fall flat when everyone else seems to be missing the mark. I spent the whole post-game stewing, wondering how to stay motivated when you’re carrying the weight.  Maybe it’s about focusing on my own stacking – small wins, individual effort – and trusting that things will shift.  Anyone else ever feel this way?
