**The Moment the Sound Went Wrong**

You know those moments in a game where everything just…shifts? Last weekend, during a local basketball tournament, it hit me hard. We were down by one, final seconds on the clock, and my teammate, Liam, was about to drive to the basket. The crowd was roaring, the energy was electric – and then the sound cut out. Not just a little drop, but a complete, unsettling distortion. 

We quickly realized the commentator’s headset – and, bizarrely, the stadium speakers – were feeding back horribly. Turns out, someone was blasting music through their AirPods at max volume. It was baffling, and honestly, a little frustrating. It felt like a tiny glitch had thrown off the whole rhythm of the game. It reminded me that even in the most carefully orchestrated moments, unexpected things can happen, and sometimes, it’s the little disruptions that stick with you the most.
