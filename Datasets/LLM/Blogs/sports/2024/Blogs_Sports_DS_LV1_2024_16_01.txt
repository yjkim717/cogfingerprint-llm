### The Real Championship Tier

It’s Trivia Tuesday again. The email just popped into my inbox, announcing this week’s cryptic questions about obscure 4th-quarter stats and legendary halftime speeches. I’ll tackle it in a bit, but first, I scrolled down to the team rankings. There they were, my alma mater, sitting stubbornly in the “Premier Tier.” It’s 2024, and seeing our name up there with the giants still gives me a little thrill.

But it also got me thinking. These tiers, these rankings… they’re a snapshot. They tell you who’s hot *right now*. They don’t capture the essence of what this season has felt like for us fans. The real “Championship Tier” isn’t just about the scoreboard when the clock hits zero. It’s the collective groan in the stadium during that heartbreaking overtime loss to our rivals. It’s the group chat exploding when our freshman quarterback, who we’d all been nervously optimistic about, threw that impossible, game-winning pass last Saturday. It’s the shared memory of sitting in the same bleachers with my dad twenty years ago, him explaining the nuances of a cover-two defense.

The official rankings are a fun, data-driven debate. But the unofficial, unranked championship is built on those moments of pure, unscripted connection. It’s the stories we’ll be telling each other for years, long after the final rankings of this season are archived and forgotten. So yeah, I’m proud we’re in the premier tier. But the truth is, as a fan, I feel like we’ve already won. Now, about that trivia… I should probably go look up who coached the 1998 national champions.
