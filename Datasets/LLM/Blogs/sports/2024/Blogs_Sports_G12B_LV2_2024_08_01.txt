## The Ghosts of Blowouts and the Real Meaning of Dominance

It’s January 2024, and the college football season is a distant memory, a swirling mix of triumphs, heartbreak, and endless debate. Lately, I’ve been mulling over something that’s stuck with me from the 2023 season: the curious case of Michigan’s defense. Specifically, the conversation around “garbage time.”

Now, I’m not a defensive stats guru. I’m just a fan, like you. I love the roar of the crowd, the perfectly executed play, the feeling of your team pulling out a nail-biter. But this year, the analytical deep dive into Michigan’s defensive performance, particularly their struggles when games were already decided, really got under my skin.

The argument, as many of you likely know, centered around the idea that Michigan’s impressive defensive stats were being significantly inflated by “garbage time.” You know, those final few minutes when the Wolverines were up by three or four touchdowns, and opposing offenses were just running out the clock, often with backup players. The stats looked amazing, but were they *really* indicative of a historically dominant defense?

At first, I dismissed it. Michigan steamrolled through the Big Ten. They went undefeated. They beat Ohio State. How could you argue with *that*? But the more I read, the more I considered the point. It felt… unsettling. Like celebrating a victory while simultaneously acknowledging a significant asterisk.

It made me think about my own experiences as an athlete, way back in high school. I played soccer, and we had a few seasons where we absolutely crushed the competition. Our goal difference was ridiculous. But looking back, those games weren't always tests of our skill. Sometimes, they were exercises in managing a lead, in conserving energy, in… well, in playing against a demoralized opponent who had already given up.

And that's the thing about dominance, isn't it? It's not just about the final score. It's about *how* you achieve that score. It's about the resilience you show when facing adversity, the adjustments you make when things aren't going your way, the ability to perform at your best even when the pressure is immense.

Comparing Michigan’s non-garbage-time defense to historical powerhouses – the legendary defenses of the 80s, the early 2000s… it's a valid exercise. It forces us to dig deeper than surface-level statistics and examine the true quality of a team. It challenges us to ask, "What would have happened if the games were always close?"

The turnover margin, a key indicator of defensive success, is also fascinating. You can force a lot of turnovers when the other team is desperate, throwing everything at the wall to try and salvage something. But can you consistently generate those turnovers when the other team is playing cautiously, strategically?

Ultimately, I don’t have
