"Did the Lakers Really Need the Play-In to Make the Playoffs?

I recently came across Charles Barkley's comment that the Lakers wouldn't have made the playoffs without the play-in tournament. As a Lakers fan, I disagreed. Looking back at their past performances, it's clear they've had their ups and downs. However, to say they wouldn't have made it without the play-in is a bit of a stretch.

The Lakers have shown they can be a competitive team, even with injuries. In the 2023-2024 season, they fought hard to secure a play-in spot. While it's true the play-in tournament gave them an extra chance, their regular season performance was strong enough to get them close to a direct playoff spot. Barkley's comment undermines their achievements. The Lakers' playoff run is a testament to their resilience, not just a product of the play-in tournament. Let's give credit where it's due."
