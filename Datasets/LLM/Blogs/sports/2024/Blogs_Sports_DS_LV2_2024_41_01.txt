### The Human Element in the Polls

It’s that time of year again. The 2024 college basketball season is in full swing, and every Monday, my ritual is the same: I refresh the AP Poll page, not just to see the rankings, but to scroll through the individual voter ballots. I’m not just looking for my team; I’m looking for *them*.

You know the ones. The outliers. The voter who still has that mid-major team in their top 10, the one who saw something special in November and refuses to let go. Or the skeptic who keeps a blue-blood program lower than anyone else, perhaps remembering a sloppy performance the rest of us have forgotten.

In an era of analytics and algorithms, their stubborn consistency feels almost rebellious. It’s a reminder that this isn't just a numbers game. It’s a collection of people with their own biases, loyalties, and gut feelings—just like the rest of us watching from our couches. Sometimes they’re wrong, but sometimes, they see a truth the consensus misses. And honestly, I find a strange comfort in that beautifully flawed, human process. It keeps the soul in the sport.
