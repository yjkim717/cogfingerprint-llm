I'm still grilling in my backyard this summer of 2024, but my trusty gas grill suddenly stopped cooperating. The first burner refused to light, and I suspected a blockage. A quick check revealed a clogged gas line. After some tinkering, I managed to clean out the debris and get the burner roaring back to life. Now I'm back to hosting summer sports watch parties with perfectly grilled burgers and dogs. Nothing beats the thrill of a live game with friends, and a functioning grill is the unsung hero of these gatherings.
