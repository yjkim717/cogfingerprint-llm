## The Unexpected Wisdom of the Bench

Watching the Raptors game last night, I found myself fixated not on the star players, but on the players warming up on the bench. It struck me – so much dedication, so much skill, held in reserve. It's like the biblical figure of Melchizedek, mentioned in Hebrews – a glimpse of something profound, yet with limited details. Where does that deep understanding of the game, that honed instinct, come from? Is it years of practice, or something more? Maybe it’s a little bit of both, a divine spark alongside tireless effort. It’s a powerful reminder that brilliance can be found in unexpected places.
