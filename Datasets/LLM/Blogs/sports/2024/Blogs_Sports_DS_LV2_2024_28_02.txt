### The Final Whistle

It’s 2024, and I still can’t shake the memory of my last high school soccer game. We lost the championship in a penalty shootout. For years, I carried that loss like a physical weight—the one that got away, the moment I choked.

But watching my nephew’s team this season, I saw it differently. He missed a crucial pass, and his face fell with that same familiar devastation. I wanted to tell him what I’ve finally learned: the final score isn't the judgment being enforced on your character.

That game, that miss, doesn't get to seize all the other assets—the camaraderie in practice, the discipline you built, the pure joy of a perfect through-ball. We get so focused on collecting that one win, we let it overshadow everything else. The real victory isn't in never missing a penalty; it's in showing up for the next practice anyway. The loss doesn't define you. Choosing to play again does.
