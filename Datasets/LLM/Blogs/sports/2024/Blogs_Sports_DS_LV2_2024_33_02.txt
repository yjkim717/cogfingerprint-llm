There’s something quietly powerful about seeing two teams step onto the biggest stage for the very first time. As Michigan and Washington face off in the 2024 National Championship, it’s not just a game—it’s a shared exhale after decades of waiting.

Think about it: both programs have carried the weight of "almost" for over 25 years. Generations of fans have held onto hope through near-misses and rebuilding seasons. I can’t help but reflect on what that kind of longing builds in a community—the patience, the loyalty, the small traditions passed down like heirlooms.

Tonight, one team will end their drought. But in a way, both have already won something just by arriving here. They’ve reignited belief in their cities and given us a reminder that some stories are worth the wait. Here’s to the underdogs, the patient, and the believers—may the best team win, but may the hope they’ve sparked linger long after the confetti falls.
