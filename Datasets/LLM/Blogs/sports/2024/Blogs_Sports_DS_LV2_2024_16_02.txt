There’s something about autumn that feels like coming home—the crisp air, the smell of grills firing up, and the distant roar of a stadium on a Saturday afternoon. It’s 2024, and I’m thinking back to those college football seasons that felt like they’d last forever. Now, as I dive into our weekly Trivia Tuesday, I’m struck by how much the game stays the same, even as everything else shifts.

This year’s playoff race is wild, with underdogs clawing their way into the premier tier and old giants stumbling. It’s a reminder that in sports, as in life, nothing is guaranteed. Every snap, every trick play, feels like a tiny metaphor—a lesson in resilience, teamwork, and sometimes, just plain luck.

Our little contest here, with its weekly standings and friendly rivalries, has become more than just a game. It’s a thread connecting us, no matter where we are. So here’s to the thrill of not knowing, to the stories unfolding each week, and to holding onto that childlike hope that this year, maybe, our team finds a way.
