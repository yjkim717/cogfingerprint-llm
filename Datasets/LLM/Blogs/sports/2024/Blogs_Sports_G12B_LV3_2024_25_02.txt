## Garmin's Gentle Nudge: Ditching the Plan, Finding My Half Marathon Groove

Okay, real talk: I’ve always resisted structured training plans. They feel…rigid. But a half marathon is looming in October 2024, and my usual "just run" approach felt a bit flimsy. Then I started using the daily suggested workouts on my Garmin. It’s surprisingly working! It's less about a strict schedule and more about a gentle nudge towards consistency, factoring in my current fitness. Maybe I'm finally finding a balance – letting the tech guide, but still feeling in control of my running journey.
