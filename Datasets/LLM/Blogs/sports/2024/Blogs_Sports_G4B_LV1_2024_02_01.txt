**The Price of Performance (and a Broken Watch)**

It’s weird, isn’t it? You invest in something – a fancy new Apple Watch Series 8, tracking my runs in 2024 – and you expect it to *work*. Mine decided to give up the ghost just a year in, a sad little screen freeze signaling the end.  I got a quote for the repair and it was… shocking. Seriously, nearly the cost of a brand new one!  Makes you think about how much we value “performance” and whether it’s always worth the hefty price tag, especially when things inevitably break.  Anyone else had a similar tech heartbreak this year?

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post on a different topic?
