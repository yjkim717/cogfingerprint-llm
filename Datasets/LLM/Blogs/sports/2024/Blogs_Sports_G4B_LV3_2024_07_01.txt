**The Feeling of Being Shut Down**

Remember those frustrating moments in a game – that feeling of being completely steamrolled, no matter what you do? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about that, particularly in Overwatch 2. The changes to the special ammo system feel like a step backwards, creating this incredibly *competitive* environment where a single mistake feels like a death sentence. 

It's like revisiting a mechanic we all disliked before – a sudden, brutal shutdown with no real chance of a *comeback*.  I get that developers are always tweaking, but this feels less about improvement and more about punishing mistakes, especially for players still learning the ropes.  It sucks the joy out of the game, doesn’t it?  We all crave that satisfying win, but right now, it feels like we’re constantly battling *spawn issues* and frustrating limitations.
