It’s 2024, and I’m lacing up for my first half marathon—no rigid training plan, just a clear goal pace in mind. Each day, I followed simple, suggested workouts, letting my body guide the progress. Some runs felt effortless; others were pure grit. But trusting that steady rhythm transformed my approach. On race day, that consistency paid off—mile after mile, I felt strong and focused. Sometimes, the best preparation isn’t a strict blueprint, but a heartfelt commitment to showing up, one step at a time.
