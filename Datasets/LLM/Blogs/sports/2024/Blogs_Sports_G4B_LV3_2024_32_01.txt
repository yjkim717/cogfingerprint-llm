**The Sweetness of a Blowout – And the Thrill of the Close Call**

It’s funny how a single award can make you think about the whole season, right? This week’s CobraKaiAward really got me reflecting on college football, specifically Iowa Central’s absolutely crushing performance in the NJCAA DIII championship. Seeing those dominant margins of victory – it's a stark contrast to the nail-biting finishes we often see. 

I’ve been watching football for as long as I can remember, and I’ve learned that the most memorable games aren’t always the ones with the closest scores. Sometimes, it’s the complete domination, the feeling that one team simply wasn't in the same league. Iowa Central’s win felt like that – a powerful display of skill and teamwork.

But honestly, I also appreciate the tight races. Those games where you’re on the edge of your seat, wondering if a single play will change everything? Those are the ones that truly test your fandom. It's a reminder that in sports, and in life, sometimes you win spectacularly, and sometimes you fight tooth and nail for every inch. 

What’s *your* favorite kind of football moment – the overwhelming victory or the heart-stopping suspense?
