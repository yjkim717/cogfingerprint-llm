As I laced up my running shoes in 2024, I realized tracking progress wasn't just about hitting the gym. I started using fitness apps to monitor my calorie intake, ditching MyFitnessPal for alternatives like MyNetDiary. The shift was refreshing. Not only did I shed pounds, but I also discovered a newfound joy in running. The right tool can be a game-changer; for me, it was about finding balance in my fitness journey.
