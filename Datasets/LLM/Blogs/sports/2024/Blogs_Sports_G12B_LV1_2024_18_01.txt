>## The Unseen Coach: Lessons from a Mysterious Figure

Watching the Raptors struggle this season, I've been thinking about unexpected influences. It's easy to focus on the star players, the coaches on the sidelines, the stats. But what about the unseen forces shaping a team? 

It reminded me of Melchizedek, that figure in Hebrews 7 – showing up seemingly out of nowhere in the Bible, a king and priest with no known family tree. Where did *he* get his wisdom? It's a mystery that fascinates me. 

Maybe success, in sports and in life, isn’t just about the obvious elements. Sometimes, the most profound impact comes from sources we can't quite trace, from those quiet influences we barely register. Food for thought while we wait for a Raptors turnaround, right?
