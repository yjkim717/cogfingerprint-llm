There’s something electric about Olympic Trials day seven—the kind of energy that makes you hold your breath. I remember watching the women’s discus throw and 3000m steeplechase finals, feeling that mix of awe and empathy. These athletes aren’t just competing; they’re chasing dreams built on years of sweat and sacrifice. In track and field, every leap, every throw tells a story of resilience. It’s a powerful reminder that greatness isn’t born in a day—it’s forged in moments like these.
