## More Than Just Hype: Watching Travis Hunter Evolve

It’s wild to think we’re already deep into 2024, and the buzz around Travis Hunter hasn’t faded. Honestly, it *can’t* fade. Watching him play for Colorado is unlike anything I’ve seen. You hear the talk – the two-way star, the generational talent – but seeing it in action? That's something else.

I’ve been digging into the PFF grades, and the numbers back up what my eyes already tell me. The guy's consistently earned high marks, both as a receiver and patrolling the cornerback position, and he's doing it while racking up an *insane* number of offensive snaps. It's not just flashes of brilliance; it's sustained performance. It makes you wonder, how far can a player like this really go? It's a privilege to witness this evolution.




Hope this fits what you were looking for!
