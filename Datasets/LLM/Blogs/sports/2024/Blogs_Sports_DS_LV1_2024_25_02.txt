My watch has been chirping daily suggestions at me all season, but as my half marathon looms, I can’t help but wonder: is this algorithm really going to get me to that 7:30 goal pace? It’s 2024, and I’m putting my faith in a tiny computer instead of a paper training plan. The tempo runs feel sharp, but is it enough? I’m chasing a feeling, a rhythm, not just a notification. On race day, I guess I’ll find out if my digital coach truly understood the heart of a runner.
