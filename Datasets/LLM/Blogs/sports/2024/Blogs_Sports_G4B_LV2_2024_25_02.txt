**Is My Garmin *Really* Helping Me Run Faster?**

Okay, real talk runners – how many of us blindly follow those daily workout suggestions on our watches? I’ve been wrestling with this lately, especially as I’m gearing up for my half marathon this fall. I've been obsessing over my goal pace and trying to stick to what the Garmin tells me. 

But honestly, it felt… disconnected. I realized I wasn’t truly understanding *why* it was suggesting a tempo run when I was already feeling fatigued. It got me thinking about coach training plans and the value of truly personalized guidance. Maybe I need to ditch the algorithm and listen more closely to my body – and perhaps invest in a real coach! What about you? Are you questioning your tech’s advice?
