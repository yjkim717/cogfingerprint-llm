## Did Baba Get Away With It? A Taskmaster Moment That Stuck With Me

Okay, Taskmaster fans, let's talk about that Baba's Double Points Task from last week! I'm still pondering whether he should've faced a penalty for, let's be honest, *sprinting* when the brief explicitly called for a "brisk walk." It's those little rule interpretations that make the show so brilliant, and frustrating! The judges didn't flag it, and I'm left wondering if itâ€™s a missed opportunity for some glorious Greg Davies commentary. Anyone else feel the same?
