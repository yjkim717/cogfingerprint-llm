**The Ghosts of the Block**

There’s something unsettling about watching a team get completely dismantled. I was watching a college game last week, and it hit me – they were getting carved up by a relentless 5-out offense. The problem? They couldn’t stop the big man from pulling away, creating these devastating drives to the basket. It felt like they were missing the core of their defense: *man-to-man* commitment and solid *switching*. 

It made me think about how fundamental principles can get lost in the shuffle.  Sometimes, the most effective strategies are the simplest, relying on trust and disciplined positioning. It’s a humbling reminder that even the flashiest schemes can’t replace a solid foundation.
