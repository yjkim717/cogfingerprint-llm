>## The Heat and My (Repeated) Misery

Okay, I need to admit something. I've been a fool. A dedicated, stubbornly foolish fool when it comes to betting the Miami Heat's over/under this season. Every time they play, I convince myself *this* is the game they turn it around, *this* is the night the points flood in. 

And every. Single. Time. I'm left staring at a losing ticket. 

It's a pattern I can't seem to break. Maybe I'm just a Heat fan with a gambling problem, or maybe I'm just bad at reading basketball stats. Either way, 2024 is shaping up to be a year of expensive Heat fandom for me. Lesson learned? Probably not.
