## The Weight of a Qualifying Offer: Thinking About Poku and the Thunder's Future

It's that time of year again, the quiet before the NBA offseason storm. And my mind keeps circling back to Aleksej Poku. Seeing the Thunder extend a qualifying offer felt…complicated. Part of me is thrilled he’s sticking around – that energy off the bench is infectious. But another part wonders about his growth, his potential elsewhere.

These decisions, these qualifying offers, they’re more than just business. They represent a belief in a player, a gamble on their future. It's fascinating to watch how teams like the Thunder balance immediate roster needs with long-term development. What do *you* think Poku's role will be next season?



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
