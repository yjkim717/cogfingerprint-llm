**The Rise of the Comfortable Win? My CFP Thoughts**

Okay, let’s be honest, as a college football fan, I’ve been feeling a little…weird about the College Football Playoff lately. Specifically, those semifinal games. Remember the old days? The nail-biters, the upsets, the games you *had* to watch because you genuinely didn’t know who was going to win? 

This year’s matchups felt…different. I caught myself thinking, “Seriously, this is a blowout.” And it wasn’t just me! It’s becoming a pattern, isn't it? We're in the 'playoff era,' but it feels like we're settling into a new normal - comfortable, dominant victories. 

I’m not saying it’s bad to win, obviously. But there's something about a close, hard-fought game that just *matters* more. It creates legends, fuels rivalries, and honestly, keeps us invested. 

I know analytics are a thing, and efficiency is important, but maybe we’re losing a little of the drama. Are we prioritizing a guaranteed spot over the pure excitement of a truly competitive playoff? It’s a question I’m wrestling with, and honestly, one I suspect a lot of us are asking as we head into another CFP weekend in 2024. What do you think?
