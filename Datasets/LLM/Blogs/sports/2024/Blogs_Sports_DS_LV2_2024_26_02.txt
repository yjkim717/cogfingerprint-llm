It’s 2024, and I’m thinking about Poku. Remember when he was this raw, sky-high promise for the Thunder? Now, he’s an RFA, and that qualifying offer feels like a final crossroads. Do we hold on, believing in the potential we all fell for, or make the tough call to free up a roster spot? It’s more than a contract—it’s about faith in a dream we’ve all been invested in. What’s the right play, OKC?
