"I'm still reeling from my NBA betting woes in 2024. Despite a string of losses, I kept coming back to bet on the Heat, convinced they'd turn it around. My over/under wagers consistently went bust, leaving me frustrated and lighter in the wallet. Looking back, I realize I was stuck in a vicious cycle. It's time to rethink my betting strategy and move on from the Heat â€“ at least for now."
