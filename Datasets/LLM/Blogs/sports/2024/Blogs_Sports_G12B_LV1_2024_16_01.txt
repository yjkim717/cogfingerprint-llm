## The Unexpected Joy of Obsessing Over College Football Trivia

Okay, let's be honest. How many of us are *slightly* too invested in college football? I know I am. It's a beautiful, chaotic blend of athleticism, strategy, and regional pride that sucks you in and refuses to let go. But this year, I’ve found a new, delightfully nerdy corner of that obsession: CFB Trivia Tuesday.

It started innocently enough. A friend shared a link on Reddit, something about a weekly trivia contest. My initial thought was, "Trivia? Really? I’m already spending hours analyzing film and debating coaching decisions.” But curiosity, and the lure of a little friendly competition, got the better of me.

And I’m so glad it did.

These aren’t your average, “Who won the 1986 National Championship?” kind of questions (though those do pop up occasionally!). These are deep dives. We’re talking obscure bowl game matchups from the early 2000s, the career rushing stats of a forgotten running back from a mid-major program, the specific rule changes that impacted a particular season. It’s the kind of stuff you only stumble upon after hours of late-night research fueled by caffeine and a desperate need to prove you know more about college football than your friends.

There's a surprisingly vibrant community built around it. It's run by dedicated Reddit users who clearly *live* for this. They’ve even got tiered standings – Premier and Championship – which adds a whole new layer of pressure (and bragging rights).  The speed bonus is brutal, too. You gotta be quick on the draw! 

What’s been most surprising is how much I’ve learned.  I thought I knew college football inside and out, but these trivia nights are constantly throwing curveballs. I've discovered forgotten gems from non-P5 conferences – teams and players who deserve far more recognition. It’s a reminder that the sport is so much bigger than just the usual powerhouses like Michigan and Georgia, even if they *do* dominate the headlines.

It’s just a small thing, a weekly ritual, but it’s been a genuinely fun way to connect with other passionate fans and deepen my love for the game. If you're looking for a new way to indulge your college football obsession, I highly recommend checking out CFB Trivia Tuesday. Just be prepared to learn a *lot* – and maybe feel a little silly for knowing so much about obscure college football history. But hey, isn't that what being a fan is all about?
