## The Unexpected Joy of Limiting Yourself

Okay, so I’ve been *obsessed* with Slay the Spire lately. If you don't know it, it's a deck-building roguelike – think strategic card battles through procedurally generated dungeons. Sounds intense, right? It is. But recently, I decided to make it even *more* intense. 

I started a "Conduct Challenge," a self-imposed rule where I only played the Defect character and could *never* use an attack card. Sounds crazy, I know! It's surprisingly… freeing. It forces you to think completely differently, leaning into block, debuffs, and manipulating enemy actions. 

It reminded me a bit of playing *Nethack* back in the day, that feeling of constantly adapting to absurd limitations. And it got me thinking about sports. We often chase peak performance, pushing boundaries. But what about the joy of constraint? Maybe intentionally handicapping yourself, setting a unique challenge, can unlock a new level of appreciation for the game itself. 

Anyone else ever tried something like that? I'd love to hear about it! Maybe a basketball game with only layups, or a cycling race with a bizarre gear restriction. Let's get weird!
