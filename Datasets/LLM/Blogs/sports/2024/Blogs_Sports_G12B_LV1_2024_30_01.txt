## Does Anyone *Really* Know Who's Playing?

It’s 2024, and the NBA is bigger than ever. Games are on everywhere, highlights flood social media… you'd think everyone would be an expert, right? I had a little experiment this week that made me question that assumption.

My dad, a lifelong baseball fan, was visiting. We flipped on a Lakers game, and I casually asked him to name a player besides LeBron. Blank stare. Then I asked my niece, a Gen Z-er glued to TikTok. She rattled off a few – Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Victor Wembanyama – surprisingly well!

It got me thinking. Do we *really* know the players beyond the superstars? Are casual fans just absorbing the highlights and the narratives, without truly connecting with the individuals on the court? Maybe the league’s star power is so concentrated that the rest fade into the background. Or maybe, like my dad, some of us are just happily sticking to our sports roots!
