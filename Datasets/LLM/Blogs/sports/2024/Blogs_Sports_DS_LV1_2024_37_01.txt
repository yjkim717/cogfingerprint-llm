There’s something timeless about settling in for a college baseball rivalry like South Carolina vs. Clemson. Even in 2024, with every stat at our fingertips, I still hold my breath when the starting pitchers take the mound. That first pitch on the ACC Network isn’t just the start of a game—it’s the continuation of a story. Win or lose, these are the moments that remind me why I fell in love with sports: the tension, the tradition, the shared hope in every inning.
