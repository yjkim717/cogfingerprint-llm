## The Weight of a Losing Streak

Anyone who’s ever played a sport knows that feeling: the one where the ball just *doesn't* bounce your way. Lately, I’ve been battling it hard in our local volleyball league. It’s been a string of close games, heartbreaking losses – a real devil’s ruin of a run. 

It's tough to shake off, especially when you feel like you’re letting your teammates down. Honestly, the motivation dips pretty low. I'm trying to remember why I started playing in the first place, that joy of the game, and refocus on the small wins instead of the scoreboard. Any fellow athletes out there battling similar slumps? What's your go-to reset?
