>## The Ghost of Last Season

It's weird, isn't it? Even with the 2024 season roaring to life, I still keep replaying last year’s championship game. That dropped pass in the fourth quarter… it feels like a digital footprint I can't shake. Like the internet remembers, even when I try to move on. Makes you wonder what else is being tracked, huh? Maybe I need a digital reset, just like my favorite team does after a tough loss.
