>## The Pre-Game Ritual, Disrupted

Okay, so I'm a creature of habit. Game day? It's practically a sacred ritual. I arrive at the stadium a solid hour before kickoff, soak in the atmosphere, grab a questionable hot dog, and *always* watch the pre-game warmups. It's just… part of the experience. 

But yesterday, something felt off. The energy was muted, the usual buzz was missing. Turns out, the broadcast was running an extended commercial break – a massive Pepsi ad followed by a relentless stream of promos. It felt like they were trying to squeeze every possible ad dollar out of those precious pre-game minutes. 

I understand revenue is important, and I’m sure the team needs the sponsorship, but honestly, it stole a piece of that anticipation. Those warmups, the tactical adjustments you can glimpse – they build the excitement. Instead, I was staring at a smiling face taking a sip of soda. 

It just made me miss the old days, when the focus was on the game, the players, and the palpable feeling of a season about to begin. Maybe I'm just getting old, but a little less pre-game advertising and a bit more… well, pre-game, would be seriously appreciated.
