## The Portal Paradox: Feeling Stuck in the Dynasty Build

Man, this offseason has been *something*. You know how you get that feeling of momentum, where everything seems lined up? That’s what I was riding heading into 2024. We’ve got our returning Heisman quarterback, a solid core of starters, and a genuine buzz around the program. But then… the transfer portal froze. Seriously.

It's a weird feeling, knowing there are talented wide receivers and tight ends out there – guys who could genuinely elevate our offense – but being essentially locked out of reaching them. We've got spots to fill, needs to address, but the system just… stalled. 

It's a frustrating paradox. We’re building a dynasty, aiming for that championship run, but feeling strangely hampered by a bureaucratic hiccup. Recruiting is always a chess match, but this felt more like a game of checkers with half the pieces missing. Hoping things thaw out soon. We've got work to do!
