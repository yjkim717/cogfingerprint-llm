**The Unexpected Rally**

It’s weird, right? This year, watching the [Insert Sport Here - e.g., Cubs] rally in the late innings… it reminded me of my grandpa. He wasn’t a huge sports fan, but when they were down, he'd always say, "Just one more play, son. One more chance.” That feeling – that stubborn belief in a comeback – it’s powerful. It’s not about the score, it’s about the grit.  Suddenly, you're rooting for *everyone*, hoping for that improbable win.  It’s a good reminder, really.
