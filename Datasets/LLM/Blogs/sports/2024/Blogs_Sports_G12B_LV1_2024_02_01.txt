## The Unexpected Bench Time

It’s funny how life, like a game, throws curveballs. I’d been crushing it in my local basketball league – feeling strong, confident, maybe even a little *too* good. Then, just past the one-year mark of dedicated training, my wrist tracker (an Apple Watch Series 8, naturally) started acting up. The screen wouldn’t charge reliably. Turns out, a repair was almost as much as a new one.

It felt like an injury, a sudden setback. Forced to sit on the bench, I've been reflecting on the grind. It’s a reminder that even with the best tech and preparation, things break down. Gotta adapt, find new strategies, and maybe even appreciate the downtime before getting back in the game. Anyone else relate?
