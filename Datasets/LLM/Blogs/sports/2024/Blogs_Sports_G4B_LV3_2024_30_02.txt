**The Echoes of the Game: Why Repetition Matters**

There’s something incredibly powerful about a well-executed reprise in sports, isn’t there? I was watching the men’s soccer final last week – that iconic goal celebration, repeated three times as the team erupted – it wasn’t just hype; it was a deliberate, strategic choice. It felt like a musical cue, building the energy and solidifying the moment in our memories.

It made me think about how repetition plays a role beyond the stage and screen. Like a brilliant musical score, a winning play or a clutch shot often relies on returning to core strategies, those essential moves we’ve practiced relentlessly.  Just like *Les Misérables* using a reprise to heighten emotional impact, or the way *The Wall* uses musical cues to drive the narrative, sports teams need to ‘reprise’ their strengths. 

What’s your favorite sports moment that felt like a perfectly placed, impactful repetition?
