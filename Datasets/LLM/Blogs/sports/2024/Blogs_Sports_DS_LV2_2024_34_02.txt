It’s 2024, and another college football season is unfolding with all its drama and surprises. As I scan the AP Top 25, I can’t help but think back to those backyard debates with my dad about which teams truly earned their rankings.

Now, diving into the Massey Composite and strength of schedule stats, I see the hidden battles—the gauntlets some teams run just to stay afloat. It’s a reminder that behind every glossy win-loss record are brutal Saturdays against fierce opponents. That underdog story we all love? It’s often forged in those unrelenting schedules.

So next time you cheer for an upset, remember the quiet strength built not in victory, but in the grind.
