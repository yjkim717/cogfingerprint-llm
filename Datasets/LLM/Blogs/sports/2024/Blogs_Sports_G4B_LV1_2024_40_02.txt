**The Unexpected Victory – Like a Lucky Shot**

You know those moments in a game, or even in life, where you pull off something completely unexpected? Last week, playing Slay the Spire, I stumbled into a ‘no-attack defect’ run – basically, my character just *couldn’t* attack. It sounds terrible, right?  But it forced me to rethink everything, focusing purely on defense and strategic card play. 

It felt a bit like a lucky shot in basketball – a weird bounce, a perfectly timed block, and suddenly you’re winning. I "slayed the spire" (eventually!), not through brute force, but through careful planning. 

It made me realize sometimes the most rewarding victories aren’t about dominating, but about adapting and finding a creative path.  Anyone else ever had a game – or a situation – throw you a curveball and force you to improvise?
