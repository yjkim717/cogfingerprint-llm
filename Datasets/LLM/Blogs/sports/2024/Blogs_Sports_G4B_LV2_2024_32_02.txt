**The Ghosts of Gridiron Past**

Anyone else feel that familiar pang of sadness when a beloved college program starts to stumble? I was just thinking about Jarrail Jackson and Texas College’s football team – a really tough start to the season, and a lot of questions swirling around about how to turn things around. 

It’s more than just wins and losses, isn’t it? It’s about the community, the traditions, the guys who bleed that school color. I remember watching my own college team go through a similar rough patch a few years back, and it hit you hard. You start wondering about the future, about the players who’ve invested everything, and about the legacy being built. 

Texas College’s athletic certification program is a smart move – building a solid foundation is key. But rebuilding a football program? That takes grit, vision, and a whole lot of heart. Let’s hope they find their way back to the field, and back to the glory days.
