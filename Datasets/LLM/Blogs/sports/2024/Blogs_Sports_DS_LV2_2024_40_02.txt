The final buzzer screamed through the packed arena, but the real victory had happened minutes before. I’d just played my last high-school basketball game, not as the star, but as the assist leader. For four years, I chased the glory of the scoreboard, thinking points were everything.

This season, my coach challenged me: “Your job isn’t to shoot; it’s to make everyone else better.” It was my own "no-attack" run. At first, it felt like a demotion. But then I saw it—the subtle shift when a perfect pass found a teammate’s hands, the unspoken trust that built with every unselfish play.

We didn’t win the championship, but we became a true team. In 2024, where individual highlights dominate social media feeds, I learned that the most powerful plays are often the ones that don’t show up on the stat sheet. Sometimes, the greatest strength lies in empowering others.
