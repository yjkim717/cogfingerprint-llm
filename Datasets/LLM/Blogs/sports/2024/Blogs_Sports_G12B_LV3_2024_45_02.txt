## Seeing Edwards Struggle? It's About That Rim Protection.

Something's been catching my eye watching Anthony Edwards this season. Those drives to the basket, usually so effortless? They're tougher now. It’s not just Edwards; the Wizards' Gafford and Lively are seriously impacting paint penetration. It’s a fascinating shift! Remembering how easily he exploited Jokic and Nurkic last year, it’s clear rim protection matters *so* much. A real testament to how a team's defense can change a player's game.
