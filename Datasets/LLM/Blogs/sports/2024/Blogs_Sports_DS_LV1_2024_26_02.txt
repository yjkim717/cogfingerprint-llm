Every summer, the same question haunts me as a Thunder fan: do we hold on or let go? This year, it’s Poku. As a restricted free agent, we can match any offer sheet, but at what cost? That qualifying offer feels like a final exam on his potential. Letting him walk frees a precious roster spot, but giving up on a project stings. It’s a gamble—bet on his untapped talent or cash in the chips for future first-round picks. In the end, it’s more than a contract; it’s about faith in the dream we drafted.
