## The Heat's Got Me Feeling the Burn (and the Regret)

Okay, confession time. I’ve got a bit of a… pattern with the Miami Heat this season. Specifically, with their over/under bets. It started innocently enough, a few wagers here and there. But somewhere along the line, it’s become a recurring theme of disappointment. 

I keep thinking I've cracked the code, that *this* game will be different. And then… well, you know. The Heat either underperform spectacularly or suddenly explode, leaving me staring at a losing ticket and a healthy dose of regret. 

It's a classic gambler's tale, I suppose. But in 2024, with so much else going on, chasing this particular pattern feels a little silly. Maybe it's time to acknowledge the Heat and I just aren't a good match when it comes to over/unders. Anyone else have a team they just can't seem to bet on successfully?
