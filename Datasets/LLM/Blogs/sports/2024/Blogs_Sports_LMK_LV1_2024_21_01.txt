The 2023 college football season is in the books, and what a season it was! As I sat down to dive into the final /r/CFB Poll results, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nostalgia. The Michigan Wolverines taking the top spot at #1? Not a huge surprise, but still thrilling to see.

As I scanned through the rankings, I was reminded of the incredible journey that brought us to this point. The Washington Huskies, for example, had a remarkable run, ultimately finishing in the top 5. Their determination and perseverance paid off, and it's exciting to think about what the future holds for this talented team.

One of the things that struck me as I looked at the final rankings was the sheer talent and competitiveness across the board. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of the players, coaches, and staff who poured their hearts into the season.

As we head into the 2024 season, I'm eager to see how the landscape shakes out. Will the Wolverines continue their dominance, or will another team rise to the challenge? The Huskies, for one, are likely to be a team to watch, and I'm excited to see how they'll build on their momentum from last year.

For now, though, I'm just enjoying the nostalgia trip. The final /r/CFB Poll results are a great reminder of the thrilling highs and lows of the college football season. As we count down to kickoff in 2024, I'm ready to dive back in and cheer on my favorite teams. Bring it on!
