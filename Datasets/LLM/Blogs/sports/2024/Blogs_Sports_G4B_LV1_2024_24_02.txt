**Wedges: When Perfect Form Feels…Wrong**

It’s frustrating, right? You’re *feeling* it – nailing the tempo, hitting clean through the ball face – and yet, your wedges just aren’t carrying. I’ve been battling this lately, feeling like a diligent student getting a C when I’m aiming for an A.  Turns out, sometimes it’s not *how* you swing, but *where* the club face lands.  Time to really analyze that contact and see if a tiny adjustment can unlock some serious distance. 🏌️‍♂️ #golf #wedges #golftips
