There I was on the 15th fairway, 2024 sun beating down. My 4-iron and pitching wedge were landing in the same patch of grass. Solid contact, smooth tempo… but no distance gap. It felt like a bizarre golf paradox. How could my wedges be flying as far as my long irons? It’s a frustrating puzzle, but diagnosing this is my new mission. Sometimes, the game’s biggest lessons come from its strangest mysteries.
