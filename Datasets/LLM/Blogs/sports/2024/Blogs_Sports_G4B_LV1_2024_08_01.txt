**Is Michigan’s Defense Really That…Relaxed?**

Okay, so I’ve been obsessing over the Michigan Wolverines’ defense lately, and something’s been nagging at me. I dove into some stats – you know, the kind that make you stare at your screen for an hour – and stumbled across a really interesting number: 19.8% of their points allowed this season are coming in “garbage time.” 

Yeah, you read that right.  The last few minutes of games when the outcome is pretty much decided. It’s got me thinking – is this a sign of a genuinely dominant defense, or are they just…comfortable letting teams hang a few buckets when they’re already down?

I started comparing it to historical Michigan defenses, and it’s not *wildly* different. They've always been prone to giving up a few points in those final stretches. But the sheer percentage this year is noticeable. 

It’s tempting to write it off as a statistical anomaly, a quirk of the season. But there’s a part of me that wonders if the coaching staff is prioritizing field position and avoiding big plays over a full-court press in those late moments. 

Either way, it’s a fascinating data point to consider as Michigan chases another championship.  What do you guys think? Is it a strength or a weakness? Let me know in the comments!
