**Friday Feels: Remembering the Reddit CFB Blitz**

It’s funny how certain things stick with you, right? This week, I was scrolling through Reddit – you know, just a little “Trivia Tuesday” browsing – and I was hit with a memory of last winter’s college football frenzy. Specifically, that weekly trivia contest that exploded onto the subreddit, cfb.

Honestly, it was chaotic in the best way. Teams were battling it out for those tiered winter standings, fueled by caffeine and sheer football passion. I remember spending hours poring over stats, trying to answer those tricky questions *completely* on my own – no cheating, of course! 

There was this incredible energy, a shared obsession with predicting plays and dissecting every game. It felt like a little digital community, united by a love of the sport.  It’s a reminder that even in the age of streaming and endless highlights, the core of fandom – that competitive spirit and the joy of a good challenge – remains the same.  Anyone else remember that wild winter?
