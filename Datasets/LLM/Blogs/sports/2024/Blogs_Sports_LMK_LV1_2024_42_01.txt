**The High-Stakes Gamble: How NBA Expansion Teams Fared with Their First Picks**

As the NBA continues to expand its reach and grow its fanbase, the league has welcomed several new teams since its merger with the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1976. But with great opportunity comes great risk, and the decision of who to pick first in the draft has been a make-or-break moment for these expansion teams. In this post, we'll take a look back at the first picks made by eight NBA expansion teams and examine how they've performed over the years.

Let's start with the most recent expansion teams: the Charlotte Hornets (formerly the Charlotte Bobcats) and the Toronto Raptors, who both entered the league in 1995. The Hornets picked Joe Smith first overall in 1995, a talented center who had a solid but unspectacular career. While Smith's stats were decent, he never quite lived up to the hype surrounding his draft position. The Raptors, on the other hand, picked Damon Stoudamire, a point guard who went on to win Rookie of the Year but ultimately had a journeyman career.

Fast-forward to the 1980s, when the NBA expanded to include the Charlotte Hornets (again, albeit as a different franchise), the Miami Heat, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Orlando Magic. The Hornets picked Alonzo Mourning first overall in 1992 (as an expansion draft pick, not a traditional draft pick, but still a crucial selection), a dominant center who would go on to have an Hall of Fame career. The Heat picked Glen Rice in 1989, a talented scorer who had a solid but not spectacular career. The Timberwolves picked Kevin Garnett with the fifth overall pick in 1995 (they had a complicated expansion draft process), but if we consider their first-ever pick, it was Pooh Richardson in 1989, a point guard who struggled to live up to expectations. The Magic picked Nick Anderson first overall in their expansion draft in 1989, a shooting guard who had a solid career but was ultimately traded away.

The 1970s and 1980s also saw the arrival of the New Orleans Jazz (now the Utah Jazz) and the Seattle SuperSonics (now the Oklahoma City Thunder). The Jazz picked Louie Nelson in 1976, a shooting guard who had a decent but unremarkable career. The Sonics picked Bob Rule in 1967 (pre-merger, but still relevant to the franchise's history), a dominant center who had a good but injury-prone career.

So, what can we learn from these first picks? One thing that's striking is the wide range of outcomes. Some teams hit the jackpot with their first pick, while others struggled to make an impact. Alonzo Mourning, for example, was a franchise cornerstone for the Hornets, while Joe Smith was traded away after just four seasons. Kevin Garnett, despite being drafted fifth overall, went on to become one of the all-time greats.

It's also worth noting that the NBA draft is inherently unpredictable. Even with the most rigorous scouting and analysis, there's always an element of risk involved in selecting a player. Injuries, off-court issues, and simple bad luck can all derail a promising career. Conversely, a player can exceed expectations and become a superstar with the right combination of talent, hard work, and
