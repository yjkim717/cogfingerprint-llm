"As I watched the 2024 US Olympic Trials unfold, I couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement on Day 7. The women's discus throw and 3000m steeplechase finals were must-see events, showcasing the country's top athletes vying for a spot on the Olympic team. I reflected on the countless hours of dedication these athletes have put in, pushing their limits and testing their resolve. As the men lined up for the 800m and women prepared for the grueling steeplechase, I was reminded that it's not just about the medals â€“ it's about the journey, the grit, and the perseverance that defines these incredible competitors."
