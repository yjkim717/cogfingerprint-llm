Input: A newcomer to VPNs seeks reassurance and guidance on how they can protect their online privacy and prevent tracking.
Output: I remember feeling exactly like that when I started seriously thinking about my online ‘footprint’ – like I was leaving a trail everywhere I went! It’s a little daunting, isn’t it?  Recently, I started using a VPN, mostly to feel a bit more secure while streaming. It’s a small step, but it’s reassuring to know I’m at least lessening the tracking and building a little more privacy in 2024.
