**The Patchwork Field of My Game**

There’s a strange parallel I’ve been noticing lately – it’s not just in my neglected lawn, but sometimes, in my own athletic pursuits. I used to be so meticulous, so focused on a perfectly executed plan. But this season, after a series of frustrating setbacks, my game felt…patchworked. Like a landscape company slapped together a patio with no real vision. 

It wasn’t about talent; it was about a lack of consistent effort, a series of small disappointments compounded over time. Now, I’m realizing restoration isn’t about erasing the mistakes, but about recognizing them, learning from them, and deliberately rebuilding a solid foundation. Just like tending a lawn, it’s about patient, thoughtful work.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most beautiful landscapes are built, not born.
