## That Gut Feeling About the Comeback

Remember that feeling in 2017 when the Patriots were down 28-3? I had this awful, sinking feeling. This year, watching the Cardinals claw their way back against the Giants felt eerily similar, but different. It wasn’t despair, it was…hope? Maybe it’s just the Arizona sunshine, but this team’s resilience is giving me a genuinely good feeling about the season. Here's hoping it lasts!
