The stadium lights hummed, casting long shadows as I laced up my spikes. Tonight was the semifinals of the 110m hurdles at the 2024 Olympic Trials—a moment I’d visualized for years. The air crackled with tension; every athlete knew this was more than just a race. It was a gateway.

I thought back to the grueling mornings, the sacrifices, the moments I questioned it all. Now, standing on the track, the roar of the crowd felt like a shared heartbeat. One clean race, and the dream of Paris becomes real. In these fleeting seconds before the gun, you don’t just run for a time—you run for every step that brought you here.
