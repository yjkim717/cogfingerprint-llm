The whistle blew, ending my final college soccer match in 2024. Standing there, breathless, I wasn't thinking of the score. I was thinking of all those muddy practices in the relentless PNW rain, the very conditions that forged our team's resilience. It was never about staying clean; it was about learning to thrive when things got messy. And thatâ€™s a victory that lasts long after the cleats come off.
