**The Waiting Game – Just Like a Close Game**

Anyone else feel like sometimes, life just… delays you? I was thinking about it this weekend while waiting for my son’s soccer game to actually *start*. The kickoff was pushed back twice, and honestly, it felt like the whole afternoon was just stretching out, agonizingly slow. 

It reminded me of those nail-biting moments in a close sports game – you’re invested, you’re watching, but the clock just refuses to move forward. That feeling of frustration, of wanting it *now*… it’s surprisingly similar to waiting for a movie trailer to finally start, or realizing the showtime is off. 

Maybe it’s just a human thing, this impatience. But I think it’s a reminder to appreciate the moments when things *do* finally get going, right?  What’s your go-to way to deal with the wait?
