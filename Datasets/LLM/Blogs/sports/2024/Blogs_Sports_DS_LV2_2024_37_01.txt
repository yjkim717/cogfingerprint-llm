There’s something special about the first pitch of a college baseball season, especially when it’s South Carolina versus Clemson. It’s more than just a game; it’s a ritual. I can already picture the scene on the ACC Network—the crisp uniforms, the focused stare of the starting pitchers, the buzz in the stands. It’s a feeling that takes me right back to my own college days, the nervous excitement that crackles in the air before a big rivalry. These early games set the tone for everything that follows. It’s not just about who wins; it’s about the stories that begin here, the moments that we’ll all be talking about for months to come. Let’s play ball.
