"As I looked back on Michigan's BCS/CFP history in 2024, I was reminded of their thrilling overtime wins against powerhouse teams like Alabama and Virginia Tech. While their record in these high-stakes games is largely marked by losses, those nail-biting victories still stand out. It's a testament to the Wolverines' resilience and grit, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for this storied program."
