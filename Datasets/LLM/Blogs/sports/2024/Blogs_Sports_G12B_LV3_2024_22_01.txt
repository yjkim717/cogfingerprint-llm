## The Unexpected Lesson from the Sidelines

Watching my son play soccer this year has been… a journey. He’s fiercely competitive, which I love, but sometimes that fire boils over. Last Saturday, after a missed shot, he just *stopped*. Head in his hands, shoulders slumped. It reminded me of my own anxieties as a kid, the crushing disappointment of not measuring up. 

It's easy to focus on the wins, the goals, the glory. But seeing him grapple with frustration, and then slowly, with a deep breath, get back in the game, taught me a valuable lesson about resilience. It’s not about avoiding failure, it’s about how you respond to it. And that’s a lesson we all need, on and off the field.
