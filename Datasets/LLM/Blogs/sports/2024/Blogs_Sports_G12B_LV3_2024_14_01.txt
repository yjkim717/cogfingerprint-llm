## That Unexpected Nostalgia Hit

Okay, so I was revisiting Forever The Sickest Kids' *Underdog Alma Mater* and it totally transported me back. It’s got this energy, this frantic hopefulness, that reminded me so much of early I See Stars. Funny, because I grew up on post-hardcore and melodic metalcore! It’s like listening to it unlocked a memory of cheering for the underdog – a feeling I still chase every sports season.
