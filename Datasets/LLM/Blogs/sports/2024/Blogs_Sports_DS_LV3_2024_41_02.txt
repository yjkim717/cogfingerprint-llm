It’s 2024, and as a longtime sports fan, I’ve noticed something that’s become a real headache in our online communities. Picture this: a game-winning buzzer-beater goes viral, and someone shares the clip from Twitter. Then, minutes later, another user posts the exact same highlight—but from X.com. Suddenly, the subreddit is flooded with duplicates, and the mods are scrambling to clean it up.

It’s frustrating for everyone. As fans, we just want to share the excitement without cluttering the feed. And for the volunteer moderators, it’s like playing referee in a game with no rules. Wouldn’t it be simpler if Reddit recognized these links as one and the same? Let’s make it easier to keep the focus where it belongs: on the love of the game.
