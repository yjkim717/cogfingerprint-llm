**That Feeling When You Just… Forget**

Anyone else ever have those moments where a memory feels like it’s slipping away? It’s weird, right? Like trying to grasp smoke. Lately, I’ve been thinking about my old high school soccer team – specifically, that one insane tournament. I can *feel* the adrenaline, the pressure, but the details… they’re fuzzy. It’s a little unsettling, like losing a piece of my brain power. Makes you wonder about the stories we hold onto, and the ones we let fade. #memories #sports #reflection
