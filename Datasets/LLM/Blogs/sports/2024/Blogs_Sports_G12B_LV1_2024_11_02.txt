>## The What-Ifs That Still Sting: Looking Back on the 2018 Stanley Cup Final

Okay, sports fans, let’s indulge in a little “hindsight is 20/20” territory, shall we? Specifically, let’s talk about the 2018 Stanley Cup Final between the Washington Capitals and the Vegas Golden Knights. 

Even now, six years later, I can't shake the feeling that things could have gone differently. That Game 5, with the Knights' improbable comeback… it felt like a turning point. Did Vegas capitalize on a momentarily rattled Capitals team? Or did Washington lose their focus? 

It's easy to second-guess coaching decisions, player performances, even the bounces of the puck. I remember thinking at the time that a different line change here, a more aggressive forecheck there… could have shifted the momentum. Of course, that's the beauty (and frustration!) of sports. We're left with the 'what ifs' and the memories of a truly epic series. Anyone else still replaying those moments in their head?
