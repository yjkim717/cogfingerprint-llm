## The Price of the Game: Can the Average Fan Still Afford the NBA?

Something's been on my mind lately. Seeing ticket prices for NBA games – especially here in Southern California – it makes you wonder: is actually *going* to a game becoming a luxury? A Reddit thread sparked this thought – are we, the average fans, being priced out? It feels like the experience is reserved for a select few. Does this vary wildly depending on the team and region? I'd love to hear your experiences – are you still making it to games?
