It’s late October 2024, and the air in Big 12 country has that familiar crispness—a mix of autumn chill and heated playoff hopes. As we roll into Week 9, the stakes are laid bare. For teams like Kansas State and Texas Tech, it’s a chance to punch that coveted ticket to a bowl game, a reward for a season of grit. But my eyes keep drifting to Stillwater. There’s a different energy around Oklahoma State this week; one more loss and their dream of a Big 12 title vanishes. It’s a stark reminder of how thin the line is between celebration and what-could-have-been in this beautiful, brutal sport. Every snap from here on out feels like a lifetime.
