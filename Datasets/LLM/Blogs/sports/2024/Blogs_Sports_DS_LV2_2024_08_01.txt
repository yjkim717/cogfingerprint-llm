### The Beautiful, Maddening Truth in the "Meaningless" Minutes

I’ll admit it. I spent the fourth quarter of the National Championship game with one eye on the screen and the other on my phone, a goofy, disbelieving smile plastered on my face. The confetti was practically pre-loaded. We’d done it. The Michigan Wolverines were champions.

But in the days that followed, a strange piece of trivia started making the rounds. A stat that, in any other context, would be a criticism: *20% of the points we allowed all season came in garbage time.*

My first instinct, like any self-respecting, trauma-hardened Michigan fan, was to bristle. "See! Our defense was even better than the raw numbers show!" I’d proclaim to my group chat, armed with the new holy grail: an elite 8.3 points per game allowed in "non-garbage time."

But then I got to thinking, really thinking, about those "garbage time" minutes. They weren't just numbers on a spreadsheet. They were the fourth quarter against UNLV, where the second-string got valuable reps. They were the final drives of blowout wins, where the objective wasn't to stop a score at all costs, but to drain the clock and get out healthy.

We spend our whole lives as sports fans obsessed with what matters. The game-winning drive. The clutch stop. The stats that define a legacy. We treat the "meaningless" minutes as a footnote, a space for the backups and a chance to beat the traffic.

But 2024 taught me something different. It taught me that a team’s true character isn't just revealed in the white-hot pressure of a title game, but in how it handles the moments that, statistically, don't count.

Our starters, on the sideline, weren't frustrated by those late scores. They were the loudest cheerleaders, celebrating the guys who pushed them in practice every single day. That 8.3 PPG stat isn't just a historical footnote; it's the proof of a ruthless, focused dominance when the outcome was still in doubt. And those "garbage time" points? They’re a testament to a deeper strength—a team culture so secure it could afford to be generous when it mattered least.

So yes, I’ll cherish the stat that confirms our defense was historically great when it counted. But I’ll also cherish the memory of those "meaningless" final minutes, where the scoreboard didn't matter, but the camaraderie, the shared journey, and the pure, unadulterated joy of a team reaching its summit, meant everything.
