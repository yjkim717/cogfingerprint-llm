### The Sound of the Final Buzzer

It’s 2024, and I just watched my son’s high school basketball team lose their final game. The buzzer echoed, not with a promise of a trophy, but with the hollow thud of an ending. As the boys shuffled off the court, dejected, I was hit with a memory so vivid it almost hurt.

I was 17, on the mound for the last inning of our championship baseball game. My arm was on fire, my heart was a drum in my ears, and I had one out to get. I remember the exact feel of the seams against my fingers, the way the evening sun caught the dust motes in the air. Then, a crack. The ball sailed over the center-field fence. Game over.

For years, I carried that moment like a stone in my pocket. The “almost,” the “what if,” the single pitch that defined a season.

But watching these kids tonight, something shifted. I saw the arm slung over a teammate’s shoulder, the shared, weary look that said, “We went through this together.” That’s the part I’d forgotten. The loss wasn’t the story; the *season* was. The 6 a.m. practices, the bus ride laughter, the trust built in a thousand silent glances.

That final pitch didn’t break me; it seasoned me. It taught me how to get up. And as I watched my son share a quiet word with his point guard, I realized he was learning that same, invaluable lesson. The buzzer doesn’t mark a failure. It marks the moment you realize what you’re truly made of, surrounded by the only people who truly get it.
