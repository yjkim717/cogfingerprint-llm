**The Play That Felt Like a Missed Cue**

You know those games where you *feel* like you missed a crucial play, even if the stats don’t quite show it? That’s how I felt watching the Raptors last night.  They were dominating, but then – boom – a simple pass got intercepted. It wasn’t a spectacular error, just a little miscommunication. It felt like Siri trying to help me navigate directions – well-intentioned, but ultimately frustratingly vague.  Sometimes, the smallest slip-up can derail everything.  It’s a reminder that even in victory, paying attention to the details matters.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a draft based on a different summary?
