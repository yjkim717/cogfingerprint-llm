The starting gun fires, and my heart leaps—not just for the athletes on the track, but for the echoes of my own dashed Olympic dream. Watching the women’s steeplechase final at the 2024 Trials, I’m transported back to the gritty feel of the track, the sting of lactic acid, and the singular focus that once defined my days.

Now, from the stands, I see that same fire in their eyes. Each barrier cleared, each water jump, is a testament to resilience. My dream may have faded, but theirs burns bright. It’s a beautiful, poignant reminder that while we can’t all stand on the podium, we can all find inspiration in the relentless pursuit of greatness.
