**The Dance of the Post – And When to Just Let It Go**

Okay, let’s be honest – there’s a certain primal frustration that hits you when a post defender just *won’t* let you breathe. You’re driving, you’re trying to leverage, and suddenly you’re met with a wall of arms. I’ve spent countless hours battling this in my own game, wishing for a quick foul. 

But lately, I’m realizing something: sometimes the best defense isn’t a desperate reach for a whistle. It’s about recognizing when you're forcing something and subtly shifting – a step back, a change of direction.  It’s about regaining that leverage *without* inviting contact.  It’s a frustrating dance, for sure, but learning to flow with it feels a whole lot smoother. What are your go-to moves when facing a tough post?
