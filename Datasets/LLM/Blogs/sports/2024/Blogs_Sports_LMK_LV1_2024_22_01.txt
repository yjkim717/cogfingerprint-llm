I still recall my 4-year-old nephew's tantrums on the soccer field in 2024. Diagnosed with ASD, he'd cover his ears and lash out when other kids cried. As a parent, it was heartbreaking to see him struggle. One day, we discovered that ear protection and a pre-game pep talk helped him cope. Watching him play with newfound confidence was a game-changer. It made me realize that with the right strategies, neurodiverse kids can thrive in sports, and that's a win for everyone.
