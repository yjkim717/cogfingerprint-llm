**The Unexpected Foul**

You know those games where everything *seems* to be going your way? Last weekend, watching my niece play volleyball, it felt like that. She was hitting aces, digging everything, and just radiating confidence. Then, in the third set, a call went against her – a clear fault, according to everyone watching. The ref missed it. 

It wasn't just the point lost; it felt like a shift. Suddenly, her energy dipped, and the team faltered. It made me think about how sometimes, life throws these unexpected “fouls” – moments that disrupt the flow, feel unfair, and leave you questioning. 

It’s easy to get frustrated, to dwell on the missed call, but my niece reminded me that sports – and life – are about resilience. It's about dusting yourself off and playing the next point, the next moment, with the same determination.  What’s your go-to move when things don't go as planned?
