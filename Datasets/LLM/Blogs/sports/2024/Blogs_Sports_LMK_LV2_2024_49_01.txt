"The Frustrating Reality of Football Manager's Managerial Appointments"

As I sat glued to my screen, playing the latest version of Football Manager 2024, I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration. The game's logic around managerial appointments had left me scratching my head. Why didn't the successful lower-league managers get the call to bigger clubs? I thought back to the recent QPR appointment and how it seemed to defy the norm. In the game, I'd nurtured a talented young manager through the lower leagues, achieving remarkable success, only to see him overlooked for a Championship gig. It didn't add up. The game's failure to reward hard work and tactical acumen with bigger jobs felt like a missed opportunity. As a fan of the sport, I know that's not how it always works in real life, but in the virtual world of Football Manager, it feels like it should be.
