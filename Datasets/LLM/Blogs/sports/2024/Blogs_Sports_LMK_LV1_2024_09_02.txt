I'm still fuming about the 2024 BMW 7 Series' missed opportunity - no chilled drink cooler! As a sports enthusiast who's often chauffeured to events, I appreciate the luxury sedan's rear-seat entertainment and electric version. However, it's baffling that BMW didn't include this thoughtful feature, unlike some competitors. It's a small detail that could elevate the ownership experience. Perhaps it's time for BMW to revisit their priorities and cater to the little luxuries that matter most to their discerning clients, just like top sports teams focus on every detail to gain a competitive edge.
