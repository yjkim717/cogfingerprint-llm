**The Ghosts of Fundamentals**

There’s something deeply unsettling about watching a team consistently fall short, isn’t there? I’ve been following the Gophers basketball team this season, and honestly, a familiar frustration has been building. It’s not about the wins or losses – though those certainly sting – but about the *way* they’re losing. 

It feels like they’re missing something fundamental. Like they’ve forgotten the basics. A good coach isn’t just someone who draws up plays; they’re someone who drills the core skills, the building blocks of success. Right now, it feels like the team is operating with a frustrating lack of precision, a certain… uninspired quality. 

It’s a disappointing sight, really. You can see the potential, the flashes of brilliance, but they’re buried beneath a layer of sloppy execution.  It makes you think about our own lives – how often do we rush through the fundamentals, the essential skills, in pursuit of bigger, flashier goals?  Maybe it’s time for the Gophers (and us!) to slow down and rediscover the power of the basics.
