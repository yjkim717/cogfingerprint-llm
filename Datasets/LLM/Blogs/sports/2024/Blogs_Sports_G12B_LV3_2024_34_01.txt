## The Unbelievable Domination: When College Football Offenses Just *Won*

Okay, sports fans, let's talk about something wild I stumbled upon recently. It’s about those rare, almost mythical moments in college football where an offense just… takes over. I'm talking about scoring a touchdown on *every single* offensive drive.

Apparently, since 2007, there have been 34 times this has happened – a truly astonishing feat! And four teams managed it in 2023 alone. It got me thinking about what that kind of dominance *feels* like. Can you imagine being on that team, knowing every time you touched the ball, points were almost guaranteed? 

The analysis detailing each game is fascinating, showcasing the sheer efficiency and execution required. It's more than just talent; it's a perfect storm of play-calling, blocking, and timely execution. 

It’s a stark reminder that, even in a sport often defined by unpredictable outcomes, moments of absolute offensive brilliance can – and do – happen. Makes you appreciate those truly special performances, doesn’t it?
