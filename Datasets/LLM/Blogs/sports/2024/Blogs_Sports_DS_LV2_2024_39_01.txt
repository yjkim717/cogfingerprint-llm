### The Last Lap

It’s funny how a single sound can transport you. For me, it’s the sharp, rhythmic *beep* of a swimming lap timer. I heard it at the community pool the other day, and just like that, I was 16 again.

Back then, that sound was my entire world. It was the metronome of my ambition, the heartbeat of my teenage existence. I wasn't just a swimmer; I was a creature of the pool. The chlorine smell was my perfume, the goggle marks around my eyes a permanent badge of honor. Every morning at 4:45 AM, that beep was a command, and I obeyed. I was chasing a state title, a scholarship, a version of myself I saw only in my most vivid dreams. I thought the pool was my entire identity.

Fast forward to 2024. My "training" is a blissful 20 laps a couple of times a week, more for my head than my heart rate. The other day, a kid, maybe 17, was in the lane next to me, all focused intensity and powerful strokes. He was the ghost of my past. As I took a break, watching him slice through the water, I didn't feel envy. I felt a profound sense of… gratitude.

I realized I had it all wrong back then. I thought the point was the podium, the medals, the record board. I was so focused on the destination that I missed the beauty of the journey. The point wasn't the winning. The point was the discipline I learned in the freezing morning air. It was the unbreakable bond with my teammates, the ones who saw me at my most exhausted and celebrated my smallest victories. It was learning how to get back in the water after a devastating loss.

The pool didn't give me my identity; it gave me the tools to build it. The perseverance I forged there helped me navigate college finals. The teamwork translated into collaboration in my career. The ability to push through discomfort? That’s just life.

So, as I pushed off the wall for my final lap, the *beep* sounded again. This time, it wasn't a command. It was a gentle reminder. A nod from my younger self, acknowledging that the champion I was trying so hard to become wasn't the one standing on a podium. She was the one who showed up, day after day, and built a resilience that would last long after the chlorine faded. And for that, I’ll always be grateful.
