Of all the awards handed out in the wild, unpredictable world of college football, the Cobra Kai Award for Excellence in Mercilessness might just be my favorite. It’s not about sportsmanship, or grace, or building up an opponent. It’s a raw, unapologetic nod to the sheer, unrelenting will to dominate. And in 2024, the Iowa Central Tritons didn’t just win it; they authored the very definition of it.

I remember scrolling through the scores that Saturday evening, the glow of my phone a small campfire in my dark living room. Most of the Week 15 matchups were the tight, nail-biting affairs you’d expect from top division finishers. And then my thumb stopped. Iowa Central 49, NDSCS 6.

A blowout. A statement.

My mind didn’t jump to the stats first, though I’m sure they were brutal. It jumped to the feeling. I’ve been on both sides of that scoreboard. I played high school ball, and I can tell you, there’s a unique, chilling psychology that sets in during a game like that. When you’re on the winning side, and the lead just keeps growing, a strange thing happens. The initial excitement morphs into a quiet, focused intensity. It’s no longer about *if* you’ll win. It’s about executing the next play. And the next. And the one after that. It’s about proving something to yourself, long after you’ve proven it to the crowd.

That’s the heart of mercilessness. It’s not about running up the score for the sake of humiliation. Anyone can do that. True mercilessness, the kind Iowa Central displayed, is a disciplined, almost artistic, refusal to let up. It’s a commitment to a standard, a promise the team made to itself in the sweltering heat of August training camp. It’s the linebacker who makes a perfect form tackle on a running back who has already lost five yards. It’s the quarterback who throws a laser into the end zone on a fourth down in the fourth quarter, up by forty. It’s the second and third-string players, who’ve been waiting all season for their shot, coming onto the field and playing with the same ferocious intent as the starters.

That 49-6 victory wasn’t just a number. It was a message carved into the season’s final chapter. In a tight race among the best, Iowa Central didn’t just cross the finish line; they vaporized it. They looked at a worthy opponent in NDSCS and decided that their own pursuit of perfection was the only opponent that mattered.

And you know what? There’s a brutal, uncomfortable lesson in that for all of us, far beyond the gridiron. How often do we get a comfortable lead in our own lives—a secure job, a decent savings account, a passable fitness level—and we just… coast? We take our foot off the gas. We stop learning the new skill. We skip the workout. We accept "good enough."

Iowa Central’s Cobra Kai Award is a testament to the power of rejecting "good enough." It’s about the beauty and the power found in that relentless drive, that refusal to be satisfied until the final whistle screams into the
