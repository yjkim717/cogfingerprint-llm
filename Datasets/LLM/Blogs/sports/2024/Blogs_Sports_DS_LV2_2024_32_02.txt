The final score glowed on the board: 96-0. In 2024, that number still stings. But as I watch Coach Jarrail Jackson on the practice field at Texas College, I’m reminded that a scoreboard doesn’t measure heart.

Rebuilding an NAIA program isn't just about new plays; it's about rebuilding a spirit. It’s in the way a player helps a teammate up after a dropped pass, or the quiet determination in a coach’s eyes when he diagrams a drill for the tenth time.

We’re not just chasing wins. We’re chasing the moment the belief returns. The foundation we’re laying now, brick by brick, is for a future where we aren’t defined by one devastating loss, but by the character we forged in its wake. The comeback starts long before the next kickoff.
