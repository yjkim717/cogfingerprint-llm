As I lace up my running shoes, I'm torn between sticking to my trusted training plan or letting my Garmin watch dictate my daily workouts. With a half marathon just around the corner in 2024, I'm eager to optimize my training. My watch promises to tailor sessions to my goal pace, but can I trust its algorithms? I've always valued the structure of a plan, but the watch's adaptability is tempting. As I ponder this dilemma, I'm reminded that the best training is one that balances technology with intuition â€“ and a dash of personal instinct.
