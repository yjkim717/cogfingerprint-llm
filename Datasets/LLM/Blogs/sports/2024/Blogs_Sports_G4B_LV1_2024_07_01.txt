**The Momentum Trap – Why My Team Always Died at the End**

Okay, so 2024 was…rough for my competitive Smash Ultimate team. We were *good*, genuinely good, but we kept hitting this wall. It felt like we'd build a tiny lead – a few stock advantages, a well-placed combo – and then *bam*, it’d just…snowball against us. 

It was like we were constantly fighting a guardian, a relentless wave of pressure that just wouldn't let up.  We’d spawn a decent opening, but never manage a real comeback.  The special ammo crates felt like they were actively *hindering* us, creating these frustrating, uneven matches. 

I think we needed a more adaptable strategy, something that could consistently break through that momentum. It’s easy to get bogged down in a single approach, but sometimes you just need a way to reignite the fight and claw your way back.  Anyone else experience this lately?
