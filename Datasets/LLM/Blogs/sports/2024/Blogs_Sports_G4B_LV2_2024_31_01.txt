**The Unexpected Thrill of a Shift**

There’s something uniquely captivating about watching a sport evolve, right? I’ve been glued to the Power Slap action lately, and this season finale is already buzzing with whispers of change. Apparently, they’re tinkering with the weight classes – a “power slap” of a move, if you will.
