"Mastering the Endgame: My Journey to Victory in 2024's Toughest Mini-Game. As I sat staring at the chessboard, I felt the familiar pressure of a challenging mini-game. My goal was to promote my pawn and outmaneuver my opponent's knight. I broke it down into steps, using the 'steps method' to visualize my path to victory.
