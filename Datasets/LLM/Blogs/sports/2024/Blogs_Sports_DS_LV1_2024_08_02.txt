It’s 2024, and I still can’t get over Michigan’s flair for the dramatic. Think about it: every single one of their major bowl appearances in the BCS and CFP era has gone to overtime. And not just any opponent—they’ve beaten Alabama twice when the pressure was absolute zero. It’s as if the Wolverines save their best for when the clock hits zero. In those tense, breathless moments, they just find a way. Some teams have luck; Michigan has overtime magic.
