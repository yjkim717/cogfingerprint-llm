**The Wedge Woes: When Distance Just Vanishes**

There’s something incredibly frustrating about a golf wedge – that little club you *think* you have mastered. I was battling this exact issue last month, staring at wildly inconsistent distances with my favorite sand wedge. It felt like the ball was just… disappearing. 

Turns out, it wasn’t a problem with the club itself, but my tempo. Focusing on a smooth, consistent rhythm seemed to unlock everything. Suddenly, the ball flight and distance felt more predictable. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the fix isn’t about new gear, but about reconnecting with the feel of the swing.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different sport/topic?
