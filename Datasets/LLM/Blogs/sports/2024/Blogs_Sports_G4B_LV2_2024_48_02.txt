**The Echo of That Last Shot**

It’s funny how certain moments stick with you, right? I was just thinking about last summer’s county finals – my team down by one, the buzzer about to sound. I remember the absolute *thud* of the ball hitting the net, the roar of the crowd, and then… silence. 

I’ve been running a lot lately, trying to recapture that feeling, that surge of adrenaline. It’s not about winning anymore, really. It’s about remembering that raw, focused energy. You know, the kind you only get when you’re completely present, pushing yourself to the limit. 

Sometimes, just replaying that shot in my head is enough to get me moving. It’s a reminder that even though things change, those core feelings – that drive, that determination – they’re always there, waiting to be rediscovered.
