The final whistle blew on my daughter’s soccer season last weekend, and as I watched her team—a mud-splattered, grinning crew—I was hit with a wave of nostalgia. It wasn't about the goals scored, but the messy, beautiful process.

It reminded me of my own high school team. We were a patchwork of talent, much like a new lawn with uneven sod. Some players were natural stars; others, like me, had to fight for every touch. We had our share of bare patches and clumsy tackles.

But our coach, a wise old defender, never focused on just the star players. He aerated our rigid formations, introduced new strategies, and believed in the power of the whole team—the entire turf. He was overseeding with belief, nurturing a blend of grit and grace.

That season, we didn’t win a championship, but we grew together into something resilient and unified. Watching my daughter now, I see that same potential for growth, not just in sport, but in life. It’s not about a perfect surface, but the rich, connected grass beneath our feet.
