**The Salt in the Air & the Strength of Wood**

There’s something about building something outdoors, doesn’t there? I’ve been sketching out plans for a covered outdoor kitchen – a real PNW (Pacific Northwest) haven – and it’s got me thinking about durability.  Like a good athlete, you need a solid foundation.

It’s a reminder that lasting beauty comes from choosing quality, from investing in materials that can weather the storms, just like a team prepares for a tough game.
