It’s 2024, and I’m still thinking about that playoff loss last spring. We ran man-to-man, but their 5-out offense stretched us thin. Our big had to guard the perimeter, leaving the paint wide open. Every blow-by felt like a gut punch—no rim protection in sight. Maybe switching everything would’ve helped, but hindsight’s 20/20. Basketball’s evolving, and so must we. Sometimes, the game teaches you more in defeat than in victory. Next season, we adapt.
