The roar of the stadium is a distant memory now, replaced by the quiet hum of my TV. It’s 2024, and my own glory days on the field feel like a lifetime ago. I was watching the playoffs last night, seeing a rookie make the exact same diving catch I used to pride myself on.

A bittersweet smile crept onto my face. There’s no trophy on my shelf for that play, just the phantom ache in my knee when it rains. But that’s the real victory, isn’t it? Not the final score, but knowing you left a piece of your heart out there, long after the crowds have gone home. The game ends, but being a player? That stays with you forever.
