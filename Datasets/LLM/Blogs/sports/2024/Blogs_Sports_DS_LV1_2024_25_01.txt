### Looking Beyond the Score Sheet

It’s 2024, and in the fast-paced world of hockey analysis, it’s easy to get caught up in the raw numbers. I’ll admit, I’ve been guilty of it myself, especially when it comes to a young player like Juraj Slafkovsky. The point totals haven't exploded the way some fans hoped, and the criticism has been loud.

But I had a moment of clarity watching last night’s game. I stopped focusing solely on who scored and started watching Slafkovsky’s shifts. What I saw wasn't a future line driver struggling with the learning curve, but a burgeoning power forward completely changing the game’s momentum. His forecheck was relentless—a force of nature that created turnovers and gave his skilled linemates precious extra seconds with the puck.

That’s when the "plus-minus" stat, often maligned, started to make perfect sense. He might not always be on the scoresheet, but when he’s on the ice, good things happen. The team simply plays better.

Maybe we’ve been asking the wrong question. Instead of wondering why he isn't carrying the line, we should be celebrating how he elevates it. His value isn't in flashy, solo production, but in the gritty, supportive work that fuels winning hockey. It’s a different kind of star power, and it’s time we started seeing it.
