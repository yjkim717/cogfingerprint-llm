It’s funny how memory works, isn’t it? I was trying to remember the specifics of last weekend’s track meet – the times, the rivalries – and it felt like wading through thick fog. Like a sudden wave of confusion washed over me, leaving me grasping for details. It’s a weird sensation, like my brain power is momentarily…dimmed.  I even got a little rush of goosebumps thinking about the pressure of that final race!  Maybe it's the same feeling I get when I try to recall a really complex play during a game – a frustrating blend of wanting to remember and feeling utterly lost.
