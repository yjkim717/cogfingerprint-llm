The Gophers basketball team is facing a tough season, and it's clear that their struggles run deeper than just a few off games. As I watch them struggle with basic skills, I'm reminded that sometimes the root of the issue lies not with the players, but with the coaching. Ben Johnson's leadership is being put to the test, and so far, it seems like the team is suffering from a lack of fundamental development. The recent introduction of NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) compensation has certainly changed the landscape of college basketball, but it's hard not to wonder if it's also contributing to the team's woes. With players having more opportunities outside of the team, are they losing focus on the basics? As the season moves forward, it's clear that Johnson needs to refocus his team on the fundamentals if they want to turn their performance around.
