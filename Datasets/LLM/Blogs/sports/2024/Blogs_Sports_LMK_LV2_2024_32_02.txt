"Small College Football: A Story of Resilience"

As I watched Texas College's football team take the field in 2024, I was struck by the determination etched on their faces. Led by Coach Jarrail Jackson, this NAIA team has been through a rollercoaster season, but they're still standing. The journey hasn't been easy - injuries, tough losses, and uncertainty have tested their mettle. Yet, they've persevered, driven by a shared passion for the game.

Coach Jackson's leadership has been instrumental in keeping the team motivated and focused. His guidance has helped them navigate the ups and downs, and I'm heartened to see the team's spirit remain unbroken. As I reflect on their story, I'm reminded that small college sports are about more than just winning or losing - they're about community, camaraderie, and the pursuit of excellence. Texas College's football team embodies this spirit, and their resilience is an inspiration to us all.
