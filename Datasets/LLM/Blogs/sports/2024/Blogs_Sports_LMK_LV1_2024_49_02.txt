As I watched Becky Lynch's trilogy unfold in 2024, I couldn't help but ponder: does it constitute a cohesive story arc? Karl100589's OSW Review got me thinking - is it merely a series of intense matches or a narrative with depth? For me, the trilogy's emotional resonance and character growth make it more than just a thrilling ride; it's a testament to wrestling's power to craft compelling stories that linger long after the final bell rings.
