As sports fans, we've all been there - scrolling through Reddit, only to see the same highlight reel shared across multiple threads. In 2024, with the rise of Twitter (now X) and Reddit becoming go-to platforms for sports discussion, it's become increasingly frustrating to see duplicate content. A recent call to action on Reddit has sparked a conversation about updating moderation tools to recognize Twitter and X links as the same when checking for duplicate submissions. This change could help streamline sports discussions and reduce repetition, allowing fans to focus on the game rather than reposts.
