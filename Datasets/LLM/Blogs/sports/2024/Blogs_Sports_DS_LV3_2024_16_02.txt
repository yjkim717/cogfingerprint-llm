With just two weeks left in the 2024 college football season, it’s wild to think how much can still change. Every Tuesday, I find myself diving into the latest CFB Trivia, not just for the stats, but for the stories behind them.

The standings are more than numbers—they’re the culmination of early morning practices, nail-biting overtimes, and the raw emotion of senior players leaving it all on the field. Playoff hopes hang in the balance, and you can feel the tension in every highlight reel. But what really sticks with me are the individual journeys: that third-string quarterback who stepped up after an injury, or the walk-on who scored the game-winning touchdown.

It’s a reminder that behind every ranking and playoff race, there are people pushing their limits. And in those moments, win or lose, we see a little of ourselves—striving, stumbling, and sometimes, soaring.
