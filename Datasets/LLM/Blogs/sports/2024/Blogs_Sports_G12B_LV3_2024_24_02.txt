## The Wedge Mystery: Why Are My Short Shots Going So Far?

Okay, fellow golfers, let’s talk frustration. I've been hacking away at this game for years, mostly self-taught, and I thought I was finally getting a handle on things. Then, something weird started happening with my wedges. My pitching wedge started flying distances I’d expect from a 7-iron! Seriously! 

It's baffling. My swing *feels* fine, tempo seems consistent, but these little clubs are launching missiles. I’ve been obsessing, analyzing, and frankly, getting a little annoyed. It’s a classic case of needing a proper diagnosis, I think.

Anyone else experience this? Is it grip? Release? Maybe I’m just ridiculously strong (doubtful!). I'm on a mission to figure this out – because consistently bombing wedges isn’t exactly the short game strategy I was aiming for in 2024!
