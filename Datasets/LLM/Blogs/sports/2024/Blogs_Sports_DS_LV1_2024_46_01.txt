It’s 2024, and I’m still thinking about the Bengals’ unlikely playoff run last season. Finishing below .530 and still making it? That’s the kind of quirk that makes the NFL so compelling. It reminds us that in sports—and maybe in life—it’s not always about being dominant every single week. Sometimes, it’s about timing, grit, and catching a break when it matters. Even the underdogs can find their moment to shine.
