**The Unexpected Fail – And Why It Matters**

Okay, so I was totally watching this YouTube clip of some seriously intricate Jelles Marble Runs – the JMR Playset ones are insane! – and it reminded me of a frustrating moment from last month’s local track meet. A marble went completely off course, tumbling down and ending the run prematurely. It seemed like a small thing, a simple fail, but it got me thinking about resilience. Sometimes, the best lessons come from the unexpected stumbles. #sports #marbleruns #reflection #2024

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
