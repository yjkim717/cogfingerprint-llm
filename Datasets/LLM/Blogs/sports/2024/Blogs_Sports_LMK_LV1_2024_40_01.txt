"As I plan my trip to Italy for October 2024, I'm itching to catch a Serie A match live. But with the 2024-2025 season just around the corner, I'm still in the dark about the schedule. Typically, Serie A releases its schedule in late July or early August. Fingers crossed it'll be out soon! I'll be checking the official league website regularly. Nothing beats the electric atmosphere of a live match, and I'm hoping to experience it firsthand. The thought of cheering alongside passionate Italian fans is already getting me pumped for the trip!"
