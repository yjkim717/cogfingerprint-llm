**The Unexpected Joy of Slowing Down**

It’s 2024, and I’ve been running… a *lot*.  Seriously, spreadsheets of miles. But lately, I’ve realized something: pushing harder isn’t always the answer. Last month, I swapped a grueling 10k for a gentle coastal walk – and it was *amazing*. 

I’d been so focused on calorie tracking and hitting targets, I’d forgotten the simple pleasure of movement.  It reminded me that sport isn’t just about performance; it’s about connecting with yourself and your surroundings.  Maybe it’s time to ditch the metrics and just… feel the rhythm.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
