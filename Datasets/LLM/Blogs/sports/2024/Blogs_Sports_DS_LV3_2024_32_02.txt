There’s something powerful about rebuilding—especially in a place like Texas College, where football isn’t just a game; it’s part of the soul. I remember hearing about that 96-0 loss a couple of years back, and it stung. But what’s stuck with me since then is Coach Jarrail Jackson’s steady presence on the sidelines.

In the NAIA, wins aren’t always measured on the scoreboard. They’re in the small victories: a new play executed perfectly, a player who didn’t quit, a locker room that still believes. Coach Jackson isn’t just drawing up plays—he’s building character, teaching resilience. And slowly, you can feel the shift. The team isn’t just playing for a win; they’re playing for pride, for each other, for tomorrow.

Sometimes, the biggest comebacks start long before the score changes.
