As I strung LED lights along my pergola's gutters for a pre-game night party in 2024, I thought about how a well-lit outdoor space is like a well-executed game plan. Just as a good team adapts to new strategies, I had to get creative with securing lights without damaging the gutters. The result was a winning combination of ambiance and functionality, setting the stage for a fun and memorable evening with friends and family.
