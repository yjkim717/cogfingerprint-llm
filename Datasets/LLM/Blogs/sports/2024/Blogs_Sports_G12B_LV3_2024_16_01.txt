## Tuesdays & Touchdowns: Why I'm Obsessed with College Football Trivia

Okay, confession time: I’m a *little* bit of a college football fanatic. It’s more than just watching the games – it’s the whole atmosphere, the traditions, the unpredictable drama. And this year, 2024, I’ve found a new way to feed that obsession: Trivia Tuesday!

It started innocently enough. A friend shared a link to a weekly college football trivia contest, and I figured, “Why not?” Five questions, right? How hard could it be? Turns out, surprisingly hard! I quickly realized just how much I *didn't* know about the history of the sport, obscure stats, and the ever-shifting landscape of team rankings. 

But that's the beauty of it, isn’t it? It’s not about being a know-it-all. It’s about the challenge, the quick thinking, that little rush of adrenaline when you buzz in just before the timer runs out. And honestly, the speed bonus is *intense*!

Beyond the trivia itself, it’s a great way to keep track of the ever-changing college football standings. Seeing how teams are performing across the different tiers – the powerhouses, the up-and-comers, the Cinderella stories – adds another layer of excitement to the season. 

It’s a small thing, this weekly trivia test, but it’s become a highlight of my Tuesdays. It’s a fun, engaging way to connect with the sport I love and a reminder that there’s always something new to learn, even in a game I thought I knew pretty well. Anyone else a college football trivia junkie? Let me know in the comments!
