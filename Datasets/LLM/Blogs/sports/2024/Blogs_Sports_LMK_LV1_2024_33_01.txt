The College Football Playoff (CFP) era has been a game-changer for the sport, and as we head into 2024, it's interesting to reflect on how the landscape has shifted since its inception. One trend that's caught my attention is the changing dynamics of the semifinal games. 

In the early years of the 4-team playoff format, it wasn't uncommon to see blowouts in the semifinals. A dominant team would steamroll their opponent, leaving fans wondering if the competition was truly as fierce as it was supposed to be. However, over the past two years, we've seen a noticeable shift. The semifinal matchups have become increasingly competitive, with winning margins shrinking significantly.

This new trend is a welcome development for fans and the sport as a whole. It suggests that the top teams are more closely matched than ever, and that the difference between the best and the rest is narrowing. As a result, the semifinals have become must-watch events, with every game having the potential to be a nail-biter.

The increased competitiveness has also raised the stakes for the national championship game. With more teams staying in contention until the very end, the excitement and tension have become palpable. As we look ahead to the 2024 season, it's clear that the CFP era is continuing to evolve in exciting ways. Will this trend continue, or will we see a return to the dominant performances of the past? One thing's for sure - fans are in for a thrilling ride.
