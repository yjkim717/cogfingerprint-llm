### The Hosting Game: More Than Just a Crowd

I was watching the Olympic replays the other night, marveling at the gleaming stadiums in Paris, when my friend scoffed. “It’s a great party, but the real global prize is the World Cup. The viewership numbers are just insane.”

He’s not wrong. The FIFA World Cup truly is a planetary spectacle, a month-long fever dream that captivates billions. But as we look ahead to the 2026 World Cup spread across North America, it got me thinking. Is the biggest TV audience the same as the best legacy?

I remember the buzz in London years after their 2012 Olympics. The talk wasn’t just about Mo Farah’s golds; it was about the new parks, the revitalized East End, the transport links that stayed long after the flame went out. That’s the Olympic bargain. The world watches for two weeks, but the host is left with a tangible, city-altering blueprint.

The World Cup, for all its roaring crowds, is different. You build or renovate stadiums, which is fantastic, but the infrastructure is more specialized. The real legacy is intangible—a global spotlight and a profound sense of national pride.

So, which is the "better" host? In 2024, as cities weigh the astronomical costs, it’s not about the size of the audience, but the depth of the footprint. Do you want the world’s biggest blockbuster, or do you want to write a new chapter in your city’s story? There’s no wrong answer, only a fascinating choice between a global moment and a generational mark.
