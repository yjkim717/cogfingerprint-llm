**Finding My Balance: More Than Just the Score**

It’s funny, isn’t it? As a runner, I’m obsessed with pace, splits, and pushing my limits. But lately, I’ve been realizing that true performance isn’t *just* about hitting a personal best. It’s about finding that solid, reliable base – like hanging a hammock from strong joists. 

I spent a weekend reinforcing my porch, making sure everything was secure, and it made me think about my training. Just like those eye screws anchoring my hammock, I need to build a strong foundation of recovery, mindful movement, and listening to my body. 

Recently, I was pushing too hard, ignoring the little aches. It wasn’t until I slowed down and focused on proper form that I felt truly balanced. It’s a lesson beyond the track – sometimes, the best race is the one you don't run at full speed.
