The call never came.

Sitting here in 2024, watching the official QPR announcement flash across my screen, the familiar sting of frustration returns. At Southport, we built something special from the ground up—a vibrant, young squad playing fearless football. We defied expectations, forged a real identity. It felt like we were building a legacy.

Yet, here we are again. The Championship job goes to someone with a bigger name but a fraction of the grind. It’s a pattern in this game; the lower-league trenches, where you learn to win with heart and hustle, often count for less than a flashy CV. It’s not just about one missed opportunity. It’s the nagging feeling that the very achievements that define your career are the ones that get overlooked when the big decisions are made. The game can be a cruel judge of character.
