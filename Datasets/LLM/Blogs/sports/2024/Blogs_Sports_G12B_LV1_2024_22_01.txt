## The Bench and the Breakdown

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple thing like a missed free throw can feel like the end of the world. Last night, watching my nephew’s basketball game, I saw him crumble after just that. Tears, frustration, the whole nine yards. He's usually so resilient. 

It reminded me a little of my own kid, actually. Loud noises, unexpected changes… sometimes a small disruption can trigger a bigger reaction. Seeing my nephew on that bench, head in his hands, I just wanted to tell him it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Everyone faces setbacks. It's about getting back up, dusting yourself off, and finding your focus again. Even if it takes a minute. Sports, life… it's all about navigating those moments.
