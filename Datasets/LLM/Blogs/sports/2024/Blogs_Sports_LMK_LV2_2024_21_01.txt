The 2023 college football season is in the books, and what a season it was! I'm still reeling from the final rankings, with Michigan Wolverines taking the top spot in the /r/CFB Poll. I mean, who saw that coming? Don't get me wrong, they've been an incredible team all year, but to come out on top against such stiff competition? That's just impressive.

As I looked at the top three - Michigan, Washington, and Texas - I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. The Huskies and Longhorns have been making waves for years, but to see them duke it out with the Wolverines for the top spot was something special. And let's be real, it's not every day you see a team like Michigan dominate the way they did.

As we head into the 2024 season, I'm excited to see how these teams will bounce back. Will Michigan be able to repeat their performance? Can Washington and Texas keep the pressure on? And what about the newcomers - will they be able to shake things up? The questions are endless, and I'm here for it.

One thing's for sure, the 2023 season was a wild ride, and I'm grateful to have been along for the ride. As a fan, there's nothing quite like the thrill of watching your team take the field, and I'm already counting down the days until kickoff in 2024. Bring it on!
