"As I watched the latest NCAAFB season unfold in 2024, I couldn't help but wonder: what really determines a recruit's playing time? Is it talent alone or are there other factors at play? I've been following recruiting trends and noticed that top-ranked teams often have players logging over 20 hours per season. But is that due to their on-field performance or other variables? The correlation between recent performance and playing time remains unclear - a puzzle I'm still trying to piece together."
