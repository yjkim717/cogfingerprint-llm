### **An Ode to the Unsung Heroes of 'Society of the Snow'**

While the harrowing true story at the heart of J.A. Bayona's *Society of the Snow* is undeniably powerful, it’s the film's technical artistry that truly etches it into your soul. This isn't just a movie you watch; it's an experience you survive, largely thanks to the invisible hands of its master craftspeople.

The makeup and hairstyling teams have done something extraordinary. They haven't just applied prosthetics; they've charted a devastating physical journey of starvation and exposure on the actors' faces, making their transformation feel terrifyingly real. This is seamlessly blended with VFX that doesn't scream for attention but instead whispers of the immense, indifferent power of the Andes—the crushing avalanches, the blinding blizzards. It’s a world built with such chilling authenticity that you feel the cold in your bones.

And underpinning it all is an original score that serves as the film's aching heartbeat. It avoids melodrama, instead offering moments of profound, almost spiritual, reflection amidst the horror. This is a masterclass in ensemble filmmaking, where every technical department acts in perfect, unspoken harmony. Come Oscar season, nominations for these achievements aren't just likely; they are essential to honoring the complete, devastating picture Bayona has created.

And here is a reflective blog post about sports for 2024.

### **The Last Lap**

It’s 2024, and my running shoes have more miles on them than my car. This morning, lacing them up for what felt like the thousandth time, I had a flashback to my first 5k a decade ago. I was all nervous energy and brand-new gear, obsessed with my time, my pace, my place in the pack.

I didn’t win that race. I haven’t won any, really. But somewhere between then and now, the finish line stopped being the point.

The magic happened in the in-between. It was in the silent, shared nod with an older runner at dawn, the unspoken understanding as you both push through the burn. It was in the miserable, rain-soaked jogs where the only victory was putting on dry socks afterward. The track doesn't care about your job title or your bad day; it only asks for your next step.

I’m slower now than I was in 2014, but I’m wiser. I finally understand that sports were never about beating others. They were a ten-year lesson in showing up for myself, in finding a quiet kind of glory not in winning, but in the simple, powerful act of continuing. The real race was always against the voice that said I should stop. And for once, I’m finally winning.
