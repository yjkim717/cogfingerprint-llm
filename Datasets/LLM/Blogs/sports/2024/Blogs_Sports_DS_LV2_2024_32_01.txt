Of all the awards and accolades floating around the sports world, I have to say, the one that’s been living in my head rent-free this week is the “Cobra Kai Award.” It’s not for MVP or Coach of the Year. No, this one is for mercilessness. And the winner? Iowa Central Community College football, for their absolute demolition of an opponent in their NJCAA postseason bowl game. The final score: 49-6.

Let that sink in for a second. 49-6.

My first instinct, conditioned by years of watching sports, was to think, "Ouch." A little part of me, the part that was always the smallest kid on the team, winced in sympathy for the other sideline. But then I stopped myself. Because in 2024, in a world that often feels soft, that celebrates participation a little too fervently, there’s something strangely refreshing about a performance that is unapologetically, well, merciless.

We spend so much time talking about "the grind" and "the process." We post motivational quotes about giving 110%. But how often do we actually see it? How often does a team, when the bright lights are on and the trophy is within reach, not just play to win, but play to *dominate*? To leave absolutely no doubt? That’s what Iowa Central did. They didn't just execute their game plan; they imposed their will. Every snap, every tackle, every yard gained was a statement. It was the football equivalent of a mic drop in a postseason bowl game.

This isn’t about running up the score for the sake of being cruel. Anyone who’s ever competed at any level knows the difference. There’s a quiet respect in that kind of performance. It says, "We prepared for this moment with a level of intensity you can't imagine. We owe it to ourselves, to our coaches, and to the very spirit of competition to not let up. To not take our foot off the gas out of politeness."

It makes me reflect on my own life. Where have I pulled my punches? Where have I settled for "good enough" when "dominant" was within reach, simply because it was the more comfortable path? In my work, in my personal goals, have I been truly merciless in the pursuit of my own best self? Or have I eased up in the fourth quarter, content with a comfortable lead?

Iowa Central’s Cobra Kai Award-winning performance is a powerful reminder. Excellence isn't always polite. It isn't always comfortable. Sometimes, it’s a 49-6 statement that echoes long after the final whistle. It’s a lesson that mercy has its place, but so does a relentless, focused drive to be the very best version of yourself, no matter the arena. And in a world that often asks us to tone it down, that’s a lesson worth remembering.
