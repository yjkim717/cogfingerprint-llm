>## That Sinking Feeling: When a Game Just Feels…Unfair

Anyone else remember that feeling in Destiny 1’s Crucible? That heart-stopping comeback, the frantic final stand, the sheer adrenaline rush of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat? Lately, playing Crucible in 2024 has felt… different. Less about skillful plays and more about who got the *best* special ammo first.

It’s the new crate system, honestly. It’s created this weird snowballing effect. One team gets a lucky spawn, clears out a crate, and suddenly they're dominating with rockets and grenades while the other team is scrambling for scraps. Then, the respawn mechanic just piles on the frustration. You come back in, already behind, and facing a team with a full arsenal.

It’s not about skill anymore; it’s about resource control. And that just sucks the fun out of it. I miss those nail-biting Crucible moments where anything felt possible. I hope Bungo seriously considers some adjustments because right now, it feels like a frustrating uphill battle, and not in a challenging, rewarding way.
