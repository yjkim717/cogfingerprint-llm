>## The Ghosts of Overtime: Michigan vs. Alabama 

It's funny the memories that stick with you, isn't it? Here in 2024, I still find myself thinking about Michigan's battles against Alabama. Not just *a* battle, but *three* – across the BCS, the Rose Bowl, and then that absolute classic CFP showdown. Three times, the Wolverines and the Crimson Tide went head-to-head, and three times, the outcome was decided in overtime. 

Each one felt monumental, a clash of titans. The tension, the anticipation… and then the sudden burst of victory (or heartbreak, depending on which side you were on!). They’re more than just football games; they’re chapters in college football lore, testaments to the drama and unpredictable nature of the sport. It’s a rivalry etched in overtime history.
