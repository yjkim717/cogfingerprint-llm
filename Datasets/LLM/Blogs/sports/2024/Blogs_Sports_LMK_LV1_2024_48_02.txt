I'm trading in my Grado SR80x for a new pair of open-back headphones, and I'm excited to dive into the world of immersive sound. As an avid runner in 2024, I need headphones that can keep up with my active lifestyle. My SR80x have been faithful companions, but after years of use, they're showing their age. The comfort is still there, but the sound quality has started to degrade. I'm on the hunt for a new pair that not only delivers crisp, detailed audio but also pairs seamlessly with my USB-C devices. As someone who unwinds with ASMR sessions after a long run, I'm looking for headphones that can transport me to a world of calming whispers and gentle rustles. If you're in the market for a new pair of open-back headphones, I'll be sharing my top recommendations and what I'm looking for in my next purchase.
