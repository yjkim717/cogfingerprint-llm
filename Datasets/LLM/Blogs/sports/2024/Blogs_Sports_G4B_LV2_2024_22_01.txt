**The Whistle & the Worry**

I still remember my little brother’s face during those late-season soccer games. The roar of the crowd, the shouts of the referees – it would send him spiraling. Not just a little upset, but a full-blown meltdown. It mirrored something I’d read about recently – sensory overload and the way unexpected stimuli can trigger big feelings. 

It made me think about the pressure we put on ourselves, chasing that winning streak, that perfect game. Sometimes, just letting go, recognizing our limits, is the biggest victory of all.  What’s your “whistle” – that thing that throws *you* off balance?
