As I laced up my worn-out Apple Watch Series 8 in early 2024, I couldn't help but think about the countless sweat-drenched runs and grueling gym sessions it had witnessed. But when it stopped working just shy of its first birthday, I was frustrated to learn that Apple deemed it out of warranty. The repair cost was staggering, forcing me to weigh the expense against buying a new one. Now, I'm left to ponder: is it worth the investment to stay on top of my fitness game?
