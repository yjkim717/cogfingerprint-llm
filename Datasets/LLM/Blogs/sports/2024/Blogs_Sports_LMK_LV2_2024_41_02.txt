As I watched the 2024 sports highlights, I couldn't help but think about the replay feature that's become a staple in modern sports. Just like Reddit users are now clamoring for a feature to detect duplicate links despite different URLs, sports fans are often left wondering if they've seen that play before. The replays can be just as confusing as Twitter's rebranded URLs. But in the end, it's all about the thrill of the game. As we look back on 2024's most iconic moments, I'm reminded that sometimes, a rewatch is just what we need to relive the excitement.
