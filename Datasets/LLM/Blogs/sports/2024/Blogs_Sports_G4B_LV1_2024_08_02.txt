**Flashbacks and Frozen Moments: Remembering Those Michigan-Alabama OT Battles**

It’s weird how certain football games just stick with you, right?  I was scrolling through some old box scores the other day and it hit me – those Michigan vs. Alabama overtime games are *still* burned into my memory. 1999, 2011, 2023… three separate battles, three different kinds of nail-biting drama.  

Thinking back, it wasn’t just the wins themselves, but the feeling of those extended overtimes. The tension, the strategic adjustments, the sheer will of those teams. It's a reminder that college football, at its best, is about more than just stats – it’s about incredible moments.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect (like the 2023 game) or aiming for a slightly different length/style?
