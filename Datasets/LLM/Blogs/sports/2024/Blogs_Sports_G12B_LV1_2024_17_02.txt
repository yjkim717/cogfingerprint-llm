## The Unexpected Lesson from a Lost Lead

This past weekend’s game was a real rollercoaster. Our team had a commanding lead in the third, felt practically untouchable. Then, *poof*, momentum shifted. They clawed back, and we ended up losing by a single point. It stung, no doubt. But watching the replay, I realized it wasn't just about missed shots. It was about complacency. We stopped pushing, stopped adapting. It’s a lesson applicable way beyond the court – sometimes, holding onto what you have requires constant effort, even in 2024. A tough loss, but a valuable reminder.
