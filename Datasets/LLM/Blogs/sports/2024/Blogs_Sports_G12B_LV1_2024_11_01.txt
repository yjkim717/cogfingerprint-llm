ow ticket prices are becoming a real barrier to enjoying live sports. I was trying to snag tickets to a Lakers game recently – a *Lakers* game! – and the prices were genuinely shocking. We’re talking hundreds for decent seats. It got me thinking, is this the norm now? Are NBA games, and maybe all professional sports, becoming exclusive experiences only for the well-off? I remember a time when catching a game felt like a genuine community event, accessible to everyone. Something feels lost in this increasingly expensive landscape.
