>## Trusting the Algorithm (and My Legs!)

Okay, so here's a confession: I've been a little *too* reliant on my Garmin lately. Five years of running, and I thought I had a pretty good feel for my body and pacing. But this half marathon training cycle, I’ve been letting the watch dictate everything.

It’s surprisingly freeing, actually! The suggested workouts – tempo runs at paces I’d have previously been hesitant to commit to, shorter intervals feeling intensely targeted – have been pushing me in ways I didn't expect. 2024 feels like the year I finally embraced the data. 

Of course, it’s not *all* trusting the screen. There's still that vital listen-to-your-body check-in. A nagging twinge? I back off. But overall, the Garmin's plan has been oddly motivating. Race day is looming, and I’m genuinely excited to see if all this algorithmic guidance pays off!
