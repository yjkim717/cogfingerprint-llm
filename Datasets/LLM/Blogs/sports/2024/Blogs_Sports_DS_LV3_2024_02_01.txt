My Apple Watch Series 8 was my ultimate running partner—until it died just shy of its first birthday. I rushed to the Apple Store, hopeful, only to be told it was out of warranty. The repair cost? Almost as much as a new one.

Now, I’m back to timing my sprints the old-school way, glancing at my phone mid-run. It’s a hassle, but it’s a reminder that in 2024, not every tech setback has to sideline your progress. Sometimes, the simplest solutions keep you moving forward.
