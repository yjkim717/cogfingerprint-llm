As NBA teams chase a championship in 2022, the allure of Kevin Durant's talent is undeniable. However, trading for him might come with a hefty price tag. At 32, Durant's age and injury history raise red flags. Not to mention, his past willingness to seek new teams has some questioning his loyalty. Rudy Gobert's recent extension shows that building around a core player can be a winning strategy. Is it worth sacrificing assets and team chemistry for a top scorer who's nearing the end of his prime? Perhaps, building from within is a smarter bet for long-term success.
