There’s something uniquely human about the weekly ritual of the AP Poll in college football—it’s not just numbers, but a mosaic of opinions. I’ve always been fascinated by how voters like Jon Wilner stick to their guns, ranking teams with a consistency that feels almost rebellious in a sea of week-to-week chaos.

In 2022, tracking those ballots felt like watching a season-long drama unfold. While some voters mirrored the consensus, others stood out as bold outliers, unswayed by public sentiment or a single upset. It reminded me that rankings aren’t just about wins and losses; they’re about perspective, conviction, and sometimes, delightful stubbornness.

In a world that often demands conformity, there’s beauty in those who color outside the lines—even in something as structured as a Top 25.
