As I stepped onto the court in 2022, I couldn't help but think about my Destiny 2 gameplay. Just like optimizing my PvP build's Airborne stat, I was trying to fine-tune my tennis serve. I realized that perfection isn't just about individual stats, but how they come together. Just as a well-rounded TTD build can make all the difference, a balanced game with strategy and skill can lead to victory. It's a mindset that translates to life - focusing on the bigger picture, not just individual strengths.
