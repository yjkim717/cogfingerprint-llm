As I watched the 2022 World Cup on my Xbox, I couldn't help but think about sharing my gaming experiences online. I've been considering starting a YouTube channel, and uploading clips of my favorite soccer games seems like a great place to start. But I'm stuck on how to capture the game chat with my friends while Twitch streaming. Has anyone figured out a seamless way to record both the gameplay and our lively discussions? I'd love to get some tips on making my uploads more engaging - after all, the commentary is half the fun!
