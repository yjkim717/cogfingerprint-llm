## The Quiet Disappointment of a Losing Season

It’s late November 2022, and the air is thick with the lingering scent of fallen leaves and…disappointment. Our local team, the Hawks, just wrapped up their season, and it wasn’t pretty. I remember the excitement back in spring training, the hopeful chatter about a playoff run. We all bought into it, decked out in Hawks gear, weekend after weekend at the stadium.

But somewhere along the way, things shifted. Close games slipped away, star players faltered, and the energy just…drained. It’s not about the wins and losses, really. It’s about the feeling. That shared sense of community, of rooting for something together. This year, it felt a little fractured. A quiet sadness settled in. Maybe next year will bring a renewed spark, a fresh start. Until then, I’ll be holding onto those memories of brighter seasons.
