As I watched the 2022 NFL season unfold, I realized that switching between iPhone and Android was like switching between sports teams - it was all about finding the right fit. Just as my dad relied on Google Messages to stay connected with family on Verizon, I wondered if iPhone users like myself could access SMS online. A cross-platform solution would be a touchdown for users like me, bridging the gap between different operating systems.
