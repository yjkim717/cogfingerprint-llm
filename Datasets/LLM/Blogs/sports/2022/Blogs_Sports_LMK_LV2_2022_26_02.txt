"My Marathon Moment of Truth"
 
As I crossed the finish line in April 2022, the rush of emotions still resonates. Months of training, early morning runs, and sacrifices culminated in that moment. Completing my first marathon was more than just a personal achievement; it was a testament to perseverance. Reflecting on the journey, I realized that the real victory wasn't the medal but the resilience I discovered within myself. The experience taught me that with determination and grit, I can push beyond perceived limits, a lesson I'll carry far beyond the finish line.
