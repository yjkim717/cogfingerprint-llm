>## The Beautiful, Bizarre Rollercoaster of Wrestling Storylines

Okay, let's be honest, wrestling narratives can be *wild*. Remember back in the 90s, the pure, unadulterated chaos of Hulkamania? It was a cultural phenomenon! And then, fast forward to 2000 andâ€¦David Arquette becoming a champion in WCW. Seriously, what a moment! 

Thinking about it now, in 2022, with wrestling feeling increasingly corporate and predictable, those earlier, more outlandish story arcs hold a certain charm. They were messy, sometimes nonsensical, but undeniably *memorable*. It makes you wonder, are we missing something by striving for constant realism? Maybe a little bit of glorious, unexpected weirdness is exactly what we need.
