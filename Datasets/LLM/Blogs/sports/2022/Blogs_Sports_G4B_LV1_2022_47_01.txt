**Weekend League Woes: When Possession Feels Like a Struggle**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 Weekend League was brutal. I spent a solid month getting absolutely dismantled by teams who seemed to *know* exactly what I was going to do. It felt like constantly facing a brick wall, a relentless high-pressure defense. 

I realized I was stuck in a predictable pattern, just hoofing it up the middle. So, I started experimenting. I widened my play, forcing my teammates to make runs off-ball, and honestly, it made a huge difference. 

But it wasn't just tactics. I also fiddled with my camera settings – upping the field of view really helped me anticipate passes and see those dynamic runs developing. It’s funny how small tweaks can completely shift your perspective and your success.  Anyone else battling this in League?
