"As I geared up for my PvP TTD build in 2022, I hit a snag - my Airbourne Effect stat was stuck at 41AE. I was determined to take down the Rat King, but my current setup just wasn't cutting it. I experimented with different armour mods, trying to squeeze out every last bit of AE stat. It wasn't just about the win; it was about mastering the game. After some trial and error, I finally found the right combo. Now, I'm soaring to new heights and dominating the competition. It's all about the details - and a little bit of perseverance."
