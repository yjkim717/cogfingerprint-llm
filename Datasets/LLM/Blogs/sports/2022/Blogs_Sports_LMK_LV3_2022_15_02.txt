As I watched my adopted pup, a quirky mixed breed with a long body and short legs, bound across the dog park in 2022, I realized that exercise isn't just about the activity - it's about the company. This 30-40 lb bundle of energy brings me joy and gets me moving. Whether we're hiking or playing fetch, our adventures together remind me that staying active is about sharing experiences with those we love.
