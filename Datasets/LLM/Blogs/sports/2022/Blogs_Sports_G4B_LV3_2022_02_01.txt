Input: Snowblower issues.
Output: There’s something incredibly frustrating about a machine that just… won’t perform. Like my John Deere 332 snowblower this winter. It’s a powerful diesel engine, supposed to obliterate drifts, but I kept battling clogging and a frustrating lack of power. It made me think about my own training – sometimes, no matter how much effort you put in, you’re still hitting a wall. It’s a reminder that even the best tools need maintenance, and sometimes, you just need to step back and figure out what’s truly causing the blockage.
