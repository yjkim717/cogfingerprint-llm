**Trading Lessons from the Sidelines**

Honestly, 2022 threw me for a loop. I was obsessed with picking individual stocks – convinced I had the edge, diving deep into every company report. It was exhausting, and frankly, not very profitable. I was chasing individual winners instead of a broader picture. 

Then, watching the S&P 500 (the SPY) felt… different. I started paying attention to *relative strength* – how certain sectors were holding up compared to the overall market. It’s like noticing which teams in a football game are consistently driving the ball down the field. 

I started building a simple trading strategy based on these flags and patterns in the SPY’s movement. It wasn’t about predicting the *exact* top or bottom, but about identifying trends and momentum.  

It’s a shift from trying to be a brilliant stock picker to understanding the bigger game.  Turns out, sometimes the smartest move is to focus on the overall field, not just one player.  Who knew a little sports psychology could help my trading thesis?
