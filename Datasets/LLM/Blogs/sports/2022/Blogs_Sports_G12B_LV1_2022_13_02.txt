>## The Unexpected Beauty of a Late-Season Push

It's late October 2022, and the chill in the air perfectly mirrors the tension in the air around my local baseball team. They weren't supposed to be here, battling for a wild card spot. Honestly, most predicted a rebuilding year. But something shifted mid-season. 

I remember thinking back in June, after a particularly rough series, "This is it. Another year down the drain." But then, a wave of young players started stepping up, veterans found a second wind, and suddenly, they were *fighting*. Not just playing, but genuinely competing. 

There’s a raw, almost desperate energy to these late-season games. Every at-bat, every pitch feels magnified. It’s a reminder that even when things look bleak, a dedicated effort, a little bit of grit, can breathe new life into a project – or a season. It's a beautiful, unexpected push, and it’s got me hooked. Hoping they can pull through!
