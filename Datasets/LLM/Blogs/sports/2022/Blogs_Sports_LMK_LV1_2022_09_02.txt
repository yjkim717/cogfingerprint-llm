"As I laced up my hiking boots in 2022, I couldn't help but think of my trusty Yamaha remote, which had been collecting dust since I fixed its annoying rattle. Disassembling the RAX33 had been a challenge, but I'd persevered. Now, as I hit the trails, I felt a similar sense of satisfaction - overcoming obstacles, whether in electronics or on the mountain, brought a thrill. The rhythm of my footsteps was meditative, a reflection on the simple joys of repair and exploration."
