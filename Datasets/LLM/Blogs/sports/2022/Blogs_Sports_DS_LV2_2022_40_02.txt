### The Man Running in Place: What Russell Westbrook Taught Me About My Own Hustle

I have a confession to make. For years, I’ve been a little bit like Patrick Beverley.

No, I’m not diving for loose balls on a polished hardwood court or getting in someone’s face over a missed switch. My arena is a little different. It’s the glow of a laptop screen at 11 PM, the endless scroll of analytics dashboards, and the frantic, caffeine-fueled rush to hit a deadline. My version of “running around” was measured in Slack messages sent, tabs opened, and hours logged—not miles covered on a basketball court.

But in the spring of 2022, a single, frustrated quote from Russell Westbrook sliced through the noise of the NBA playoffs and landed right in the middle of my own life.

“He just trick y’all, man, just running around, doing nothing.”

Westbrook was, of course, talking about his longtime on-court nemesis, Pat Bev. It was a raw, emotional dismissal. But it sparked something fascinating in the basketball world. Statisticians and analysts, armed with player-tracking data, went to work. They could literally measure the distance traveled by every player. They could correlate that movement with tangible outcomes: points, assists, stops, wins.

The question was simple: Was Beverley’s notorious, high-octane activity just chaotic motion, or was it purposeful, productive energy?

As the articles started to pop up on my screen—full of charts and advanced metrics—I found myself less interested in the verdict on Beverley and more focused on the mirror it was holding up to me. I started to see my own work habits in that data.

I remembered a day last month. I’d been “on” from 7 AM to 9 PM. My fitness tracker thought I’d run a marathon, but it was just me pacing between my desk and the coffee machine. I’d sent dozens of emails, hopped on three different video calls, and had eight different projects “in progress.” I felt exhausted. I felt productive.

But when I looked at what I’d actually *accomplished*? The one key piece of writing I needed to finish was still a mess of half-formed ideas. I had been a whirlwind of activity, but had I moved the ball forward? Or was I just… running around?

The NBA’s data scientists were essentially asking the same question of Beverley. And the results, as they often are in both sports and life, were nuanced. Sure, Beverley wasn’t putting up All-Star scoring numbers. But the data showed his movement wasn’t wasted. He was hounding ball-handlers, disrupting passing lanes, and creating chaos that led to turnovers and missed shots for the other team. His "running around" had a direct, if not always glamorous, impact on the game.

It made me realize there are two types of hustle.

There’s **Westbrook Hustle**: explosive, monumental, and statistically undeniable. It’s the triple-double. It’s the thunderous dunk. It’s the big, finished project you can point to and say, “I did that.” It’s output in its most visible
