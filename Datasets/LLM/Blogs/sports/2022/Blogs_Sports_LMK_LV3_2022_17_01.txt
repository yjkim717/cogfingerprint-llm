"As I watched the 2022 sports season unfold, I realized that being a 'credit card MVP' isn't just about personal rewards - it's about sharing the perks with others. Adding an authorized user to my American Express credit card allowed my family member to earn rewards points too. We both benefited from travel perks, like airport lounge access. The cost was minimal, and the rewards were worth it. Just like a well-executed team play, strategically using credit card benefits can be a winning move."
