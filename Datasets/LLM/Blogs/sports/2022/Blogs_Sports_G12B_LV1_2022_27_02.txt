>## Seeing History Rhyme: Peña and the Echoes of Tulo

Remember back in 2012? Troy Tulowitzki’s rookie season was just… electric. The Rockies shortstop was an instant sensation, blending offensive pop with Gold Glove-caliber defense. Watching Jeremy Peña this year, 2022, it's hard *not* to think of Tulo. 

Peña's 22 home runs are fantastic, but it’s his all-around game – the defensive wizardry, the hustle – that really shines. Looking at advanced metrics like DRS and OAA, the similarities are striking. It’s a rare thing to see a player arrive and immediately impact a team so profoundly, and it's got me feeling nostalgic for a bygone era of baseball brilliance. Could Peña be building something truly special?
