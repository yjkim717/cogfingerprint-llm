There’s a moment in sports that sticks with you—a quote, a gesture, a split-second interaction that feels bigger than the game itself. I still remember watching the 2022 World Cup, when a rival player helped an opponent up after a hard tackle. No words were exchanged, but the respect was palpable. It reminded me that beyond the goals and glory, sports are about character and connection.

Imagine if we turned those moments into a game: sharing our favorite quotes or gestures, then building on them like dialogue. It’s in these exchanges—on the field or off—that we find the heart of competition: not just winning, but understanding each other, one play at a time.
