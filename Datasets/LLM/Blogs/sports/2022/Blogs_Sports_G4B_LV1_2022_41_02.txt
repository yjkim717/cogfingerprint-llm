**The Sticky Situation: When Reddit Gets a Little Too Enthusiastic**

Okay, so I was scrolling through r/GeorgiaTechFootball last fall – 2022, remember? – completely absorbed in the usual pre-game buzz. Then, BAM! A post about a particularly aggressive meme was suddenly plastered to the top with a giant sticky.  

Now, I’m used to seeing stickies on Reddit – they're supposed to highlight genuinely interesting or important content. But this felt…off. Turns out, a moderator (an admin, really) had accidentally stuckied a blatant spam post.  It was a chaotic few minutes as they frantically removed it and apologized. 

It got me thinking about the role of moderators online, especially in passionate communities like sports subreddits.  It's easy to get caught up in the excitement and want to highlight something, but a little misstep can throw the whole place off.  It’s a reminder that even the best-intentioned actions can have unintended consequences.  Anyone else have a similar moderation mishap story?
