## The Unexpected Joy of a Blurry Race Photo

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a slightly out-of-focus image can capture so much more than a perfect one. I was scrolling through Reddit the other day and saw a thread dedicated to sharing running photos – a weekly "Photo Friday" for parkrun enthusiasts. It got me thinking about my own race memories.

I don't have many stunning action shots. Mostly, it's blurry glimpses of my face, mid-stride, probably grimacing! But those imperfect pictures? They're tied to the feeling of pushing through, the encouragement of my running buddy, the sheer relief of crossing that finish line. They're a snapshot of *that* Saturday morning in 2022, and that's pretty special. Sometimes, the best memories aren't perfectly framed. They're just… real.
