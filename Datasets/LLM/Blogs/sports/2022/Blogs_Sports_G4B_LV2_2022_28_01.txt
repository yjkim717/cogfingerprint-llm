**The Year I Became a Rookie Card Obsessive**

Okay, confession time: 2022 was *the* year I went full-blown obsessed with rookie cards. I know, it sounds a little…nerdy. But there’s something genuinely captivating about that first card – the one that officially marks a player’s arrival in the big leagues. 

I’d always collected baseball cards, of course, but this year it was different. I was particularly fixated on tracking the debut of a young pitcher, someone I’d been following as a minor league prospect for ages.
