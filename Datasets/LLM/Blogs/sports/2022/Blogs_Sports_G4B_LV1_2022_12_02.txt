**Is Klay Thompson a Fantasy Football Bust… or a Bargain?**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2022 was rough for Warriors fans – and probably a nightmare for anyone holding Klay Thompson in their fantasy basketball league. His numbers just… flatlined. I remember staring at my ADP (Average Draft Position) and feeling a serious case of buyer’s remorse. He was going way higher than his production warranted, and I was seriously questioning if I’d made a huge mistake.

Was he a bust? The whispers started loud and clear. But then, something shifted. The injuries mounted for the Warriors, and Klay found himself logging more minutes than we’d anticipated. Suddenly, he was a reliable source of points, and the guys who held onto him were feeling pretty smug. 

It’s a classic “buy low” scenario, isn’t it? Maybe 2022 was a reminder that sometimes, the most valuable moves are the ones that require a little faith and a willingness to bet on a player’s potential when everyone else is moving on.
