**The Unexpected Push of a New Strategy**

2022 felt like a year of small, persistent pushes in my running. I’d been hitting the pavement consistently, but honestly, my times weren’t improving. It was frustrating – like I was putting in the work but not seeing the results I wanted. Then, a coach friend suggested I really focus on my “servo press” – that’s his term for really *feeling* the ground beneath my feet, engaging every muscle with each stride. 

It sounded a bit woo-woo at first, but I started experimenting. I slowed down, consciously paying attention to my form, and really digging into the power of each step.  It felt almost…deliberate. 

And you know what? It worked!  My times started to shift, not dramatically, but noticeably.  It made me think about my broader “website ranking” – my overall performance – and how a focused, strategic approach, like that little adjustment to my running, could make a huge difference.  Sometimes, the best marketing strategy, just like a well-executed run, starts with a single, intentional push.
