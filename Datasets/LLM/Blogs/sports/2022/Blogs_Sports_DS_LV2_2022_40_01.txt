There’s something almost magical about a par-3. You stand there, just you, the ball, and a tiny green in the distance. No excuses, no layups. It’s a pure test of nerve.

Last weekend, on the 7th at Oak Creek, that test felt bigger than ever. The wind was up, and my 5-iron felt heavy in my hands. But I took a breath, trusted the swing, and watched the ball trace a perfect arc against the gray sky. It landed softly, just 15 feet from the pin. My heart was hammering.

Walking onto that green, the world narrowed to that little white ball and the cup. The birdie putt felt like it took a minute to roll. And when it dropped? Pure, unadulterated joy. It was only my second birdie ever, a small victory in the grand scheme, but in that moment, it felt like winning a major. It’s these fleeting triumphs, these small, perfect shots, that keep you coming back, reminding you why you fell in love with the game in the first place.
