**Title: The Ghosts of Playoffs Past: How Often Has Your Team Been Eliminated by the Champ?**

Okay, football fans, let's get a little existential for a moment. We're deep in the playoffs, the air is thick with tension, and every game feels like a potential turning point. But it got me thinking… how many times have our favorite teams been *stopped* on their tracks by the team that ultimately lifted the Lombardi Trophy? 

I stumbled across this really cool visualization recently (you can find it with a quick search – it maps out NFL team elimination history by Super Bowl winner) and it was a surprisingly sobering, yet fascinating, look at the brutal reality of playoff football. It’s easy to get caught up in the 'what ifs' of a single season, but seeing the historical data laid out like that really puts things in perspective.

For some teams, the story is a long, heartbreaking series of near misses and defeats at the hands of eventual champions. You look at franchises like the Vikings, or the Bills (especially poignant considering their recent struggles), and you see a pattern of elimination by the eventual Super Bowl victor. It's a reminder that even the best teams, the ones boasting incredible talent and seemingly destined for greatness, can fall short against a team just a little bit *more* clutch in that crucial moment.

Then you have teams like the Steelers or the Patriots, who seem to have a knack for being on the *winning* side of those elimination matchups. And that, of course, is what makes this game so captivating. 

It’s a testament to the unpredictable nature of the NFL, isn’t it?  A single play, one bad call, a hot hand on the other side... it can all change everything.  This year, in 2022, we’re witnessing another chapter in these ongoing narratives. Who will be the team that breaks the cycle?  Who will add another ghost to the playoff history books? 

It's a reminder that even in the midst of the excitement and the hope, there's a long and often painful history of playoff elimination behind every team. And that's part of what makes following the NFL so compelling. Let’s see who’s writing the next chapter.

What does your team’s history say? Let me know in the comments!
