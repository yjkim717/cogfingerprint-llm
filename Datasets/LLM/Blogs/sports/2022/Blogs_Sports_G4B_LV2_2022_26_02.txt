**The Weight of a Memory Card**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single photograph can suddenly transport you right back. Last year, I was sifting through a box of old family photos – specifically, my dad’s baseball cards from his high school days.  A worn-out Mickey Mantle, a slightly faded Jackie Robinson... instantly, I was ten years old again, watching him meticulously organize his collection.

I started wondering about the value of those cards, not just monetary, but the *value* of the memories they held.  It made me think about my own sports memorabilia – a signed jersey, a ticket stub from a legendary game.  Do you ever feel a little hesitant to sell those pieces of your past, knowing you’re letting go of a tangible link to a cherished moment?  It’s a weird feeling, balancing nostalgia with the reality of things.
