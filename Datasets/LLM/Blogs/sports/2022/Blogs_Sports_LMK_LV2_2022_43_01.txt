"Last season was a rollercoaster for my fantasy football team. In 2022, I went all-in on a few players who tanked, and it nearly cost me the championship. As I reflect on what went wrong, I realize it wasn't just the players - I was too attached to my preconceived notions. It was a tough lesson to learn, but I'm already applying it to this season. Sometimes, it's okay to pivot and adjust your strategy."
