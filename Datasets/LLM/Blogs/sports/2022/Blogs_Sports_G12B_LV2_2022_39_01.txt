## The Quiet Resilience of Disc Golf

Remember that wild 2022? So much happening. But lately, I’ve been thinking about disc golf. It's not exactly the flashiest sport, is it? No roaring crowds, no multi-million dollar contracts. Just you, a plastic disc, and a whole lot of trees.

I started playing last spring, feeling a bit lost, needing something grounding. And honestly? Watching someone calmly navigate a tricky shot, adjusting their aim with quiet focus... it's mesmerizing. It reminded me that strength isn't always about explosive power. Sometimes, it’s about consistent effort, adapting to the unexpected, and finding your way through the obstacles. A surprisingly good metaphor for life, wouldn't you say?
