As I geared up for the big game in 2022, I stumbled upon a graphic tee that caught my eye - a mashup of Stranger Things characters and a Demogorgon monster. It reminded me of my favorite sports team's fierce spirit. Just like the kids in Hawkins, my teammates and I were ready to take on the competition. I rocked that tee on game day, and it became a conversation starter among fans.
