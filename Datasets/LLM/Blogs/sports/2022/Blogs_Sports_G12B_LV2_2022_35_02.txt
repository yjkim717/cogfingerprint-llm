## The Unexpected Joy of the Long Game: Running Marathons Later in Life

It’s November 2022, and the air has that crisp bite to it. The kind that makes you want to burrow under a blanket with a good book. But instead, I'm lacing up my running shoes. Again.

For a long time, the thought of running a marathon felt… ludicrous. Like something reserved for those genetically blessed, incredibly disciplined individuals who've been pounding pavement since they were practically toddlers. I wasn’t one of them. My athletic peak involved a moderately competitive high school volleyball team and a whole lot of weekend hiking. Running? It was something I *thought* I should do, but never quite prioritized.

Then, life happened. The intense focus of young adulthood shifted to careers, relationships, and the general chaos of building a life. Exercise became squeezed in, often sacrificed, and always a source of a little guilt. I dabbled in gyms, yoga classes, even a brief and disastrous foray into CrossFit. Nothing really *stuck*.

It wasn't until I hit my early forties – a point where the creeping stiffness and the occasional, unexplained back pain started to become a bit more insistent – that I seriously considered running. Partly out of necessity (those aches weren’t getting better on their own), and partly, I think, out of a quiet longing for something more. Something challenging, something rewarding, something *mine*.

I started small, ridiculously small. A mile. Then a mile and a half.  The initial discomfort was… significant. My lungs burned, my legs screamed, and I questioned my sanity on a daily basis.  There were days I wanted to quit. Days I *did* quit, only to drag myself out for another painfully slow, short run the next morning.

But slowly, something shifted. The discomfort lessened.  The burning became a manageable ache. My body started to adapt. And then, almost imperceptibly, I started to *enjoy* it.

I remember the first time I ran three miles without stopping. It wasn’t a record-breaking pace, far from it, but it felt like summiting Everest. A small victory, a tangible sign that I was making progress.  That initial spark ignited a fire.

Fast forward a few years, and here I am, a (very) amateur marathoner. I’ve run three marathons now, and I’m training for a fourth next spring. And let me tell you, it's been a journey unlike any other.

It's funny, because when I started, I was obsessed with speed. I wanted to be *good*. I devoured articles on training plans, nutrition, and race strategies. I compared myself to other runners, constantly falling short.  The pressure I put on myself was immense, and frankly, it sucked the joy right out of it.

Then I had a realization
