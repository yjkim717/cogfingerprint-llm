**The Touchdown That Stood Out**

Honestly, 2022 was a year of watching something truly special unfold with Brock Bowers. I kept seeing flashes of brilliance, but nothing prepared me for the sheer volume of touchdowns he was hauling in. Seeing him break Terrence Edwards’ old record – 12 receiving touchdowns – felt huge. It wasn't just a record; it was a testament to his explosive talent and the way the offense built around him. A single season, a remarkable achievement. It’s moments like that that remind you why you love the game.
