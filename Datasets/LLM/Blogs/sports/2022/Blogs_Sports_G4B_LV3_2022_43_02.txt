**The Grind That Just Won’t Quit**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 felt like a year of relentless pushes. I got really sucked into trying to master this new climbing route at the gym. It wasn’t even *that* technically difficult, but my brain just decided it was a personal Everest. I’d get to a tricky section, lose my grip, and just…frustrate the hell out of myself. 

It mirrored that Maliketh fight in Elden Ring, honestly. I’m a pretty methodical climber, usually, but this one just kept throwing curveballs. There were moments I wanted to chuck my chalk bag and walk away.  

But something about that stubborn refusal to give up, that grit – it’s addictive, isn’t it? It’s not about the immediate victory, but the *persistence* of pushing through the frustration.  I kept analyzing, adapting, and trying again. 

Eventually, I stuck it.  That feeling of finally conquering that hold?  It was pure, unadulterated satisfaction.  Sometimes, the hardest challenges are the ones that teach you the most about yourself.
