>## Is Klay Still a Thing in Fantasy? Maybe… But at What Cost?

Okay, let's be honest, watching Klay Thompson this year has been… weird. After that devastating injury saga, we all wanted the triumphant return, the vintage Klay splashing threes and reminding everyone why he's a legend. And he *has* had moments. But the minutes are still being managed, the consistency is shaky, and the overall impact on the Warriors just hasn't been the same.

It’s got me re-evaluating his fantasy value. I'm seeing a lot of people still holding onto him, hoping for that old magic. But is it worth the roster spot? My eye keeps drifting to guys like Bojan Bogdanovic, who's been quietly putting up solid numbers. 

I’m seriously considering a "buy-low" opportunity on Thompson. If you’re sitting on a player you can flip for Klay right now, it *could* pay off down the road. But you need to be realistic. Don't mortgage your season on a player who might still be finding his rhythm. This isn’t the 2016 Klay. This is 2022 Klay, and that's a very different beast. Thoughts? Let's debate!
