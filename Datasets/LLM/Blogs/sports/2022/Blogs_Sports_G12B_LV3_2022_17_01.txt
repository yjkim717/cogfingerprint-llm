## The Unexpected Assist: How a Teammate (and a Credit Card Strategy!) Helped Me Level Up

Remember that feeling of being stuck? Like you’re putting in the work, but not quite seeing the gains? That’s how I felt with my fantasy football league this year (2022). I was chasing points, constantly tweaking my lineup, and still lagging behind. 

Then, a friend – a *really* savvy friend – suggested something unexpected: leveraging his American Express rewards. He’d add me as an authorized user on his card, boosting his points and, crucially, letting me benefit from some of those sweet rewards. It felt a little unconventional, but honestly, it sparked a similar thought process to how a good teammate elevates a whole team. 

Sometimes, the biggest wins come from unexpected collaborations, whether on the field or in racking up those travel points!
