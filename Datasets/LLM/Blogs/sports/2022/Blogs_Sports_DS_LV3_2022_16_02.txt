There’s something almost mythical about the College Football Belt—it’s not just a trophy, it’s a story. And right now, that story is painted in Oregon green and yellow. I still remember the buzz back in 2022, watching the Ducks defend that legacy against a gritty UCLA squad. It wasn’t just a game; it felt like a chapter in a saga, one where every first down and every goal-line stand mattered just a little bit more.

Looking back, I think about the teams that held it before—Baylor, BYU—and how each left their mark. But Oregon? They’ve made it theirs. There’s a weight to carrying that belt, a mix of pride and pressure that’s palpable even from the stands. Now, with California up next, it’s another chance to prove they belong in this unfolding legend.

As fans, we don’t just watch the scoreboard; we live the narrative. And in 2022, that narrative was Oregon’s to write—one hard-fought victory at a time.
