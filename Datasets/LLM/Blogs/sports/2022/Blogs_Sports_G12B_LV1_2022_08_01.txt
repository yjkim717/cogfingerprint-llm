## Early Season Jitters and the Wolverines' Red Zone Promise

Okay, so we’re a few weeks into the 2022 season, and the Michigan Wolverines are… well, they're Michigan. But something's been on my mind: the red zone. We saw five drives punch in touchdowns recently, which is fantastic! Yet, it felt a little *too* good, almost like a burst before settling in. 

Historically, Harbaugh’s Wolverines tend to find their stride later. Could this be a sign? Are we seeing a peak early, or just a taste of what's to come as the offense truly clicks? I’m cautiously optimistic, folks. Let's hope they build on this!
