### To Grade or Not to Grade: The Alpha Quandary

Staring at my Beta Timetwister, a relic from Magic’s dawn, I feel a familiar tension. Its edges are soft, but the art is crisp—a classic "moderately played" gem. The question echoes in every collector's mind: should this go to a grading service?

The debate is fierce. On one hand, slabbing it in a plastic tomb feels clinical, robbing the card of its tactile history. On the other, the reality of the marketplace on TCG Player is undeniable. For high-value Alpha and Beta cards, a high grade doesn't just verify condition; it supercharges the price, creating a tangible asset.

My conclusion? It's a numbers game with a soul. If the potential graded value significantly outstrips the raw price and grading fees, it's a smart financial move. But for cards I still want to *feel*, the ones that connect me to the game's past, I’ll keep them raw, their stories untampered with.

### The Last Lap

It was the final meet of my senior year, 2022. The air was crisp, and the stadium lights hummed with a lifetime of memories. My legs were lead, my lungs burned, but the roar of the crowd was a tangible force pushing me forward. This wasn't about winning anymore; it was about honoring the thousands of hours, the early mornings, and the bond with my teammates.

As I crossed the finish line, a wave of exhaustion and euphoria washed over me. I looked back at the track, not at my time, but at the journey. Sports had taught me about resilience, about community, and about digging deeper than I thought possible. That last race wasn't an end; it was a thank you to the track for shaping me.
