There’s something special about the weeks leading up to college football season—the anticipation, the debates, the hope. I remember checking the /r/CFB Poll updates back in 2022, feeling that familiar buzz when they announced the main voters and introduced provisional voting for everyone. It wasn’t just about rankings; it was about community.

For years, I’d watch from the sidelines, but that season, the provisional option made me feel included, like my voice mattered too. The selection process felt transparent, more democratic. And when the preseason poll dropped on August 24th, it wasn’t just a list—it was the start of countless conversations, friendly rivalries, and shared excitement.

That’s the beauty of sports: it connects us, turning strangers into fellow fans, all united by a love of the game.
