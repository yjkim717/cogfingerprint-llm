"The St. Louis Cardinals' 2022 season was marked by a thrilling sweep against the Baltimore Orioles. But did you know the Cards have a rich history of dominating AL East teams? In fact, they've set all-time records against some of the league's top clubs. As a Cardinals fan, it's exciting to see my team continue this trend. With a strong roster and fierce competitiveness, the Cards are a force to be reckoned with in the MLB."
