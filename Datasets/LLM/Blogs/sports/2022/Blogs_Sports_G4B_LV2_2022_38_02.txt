**The Week 2 Obsession: Why We *Need* These Rankings**

Okay, let’s be honest – as football season kicks into full gear, there’s a certain ritual we all fall into. It starts with the opening kickoff, then quickly spirals into a desperate need to check those power rankings. Specifically, Week 2 rankings.

We’re so invested in these teams, these players, that we crave that external validation – a ranking that tells us we're seeing things correctly.
