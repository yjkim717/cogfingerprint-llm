### The Story a Race Photo Tells

It’s 2022, and my camera roll is a chaotic archive of my running life. But it’s the race photos I treasure most. You know the ones—the unposed, mid-stride shots where you’re either grimacing in glorious agony or beaming with a joy you can’t fake.

I used to dread them, cringing at my form or my expression. But I’ve had a change of heart. Now, I see a story in every pixel. That photo from last month’s parkrun isn't just me on my regular route; it’s the memory of the stranger who gave me a thumbs-up at the final turn, giving me that last burst of energy. It’s a testament to showing up, even when I didn't feel like it.

These snapshots are more than just "Photo Friday" fodder for the running community. They’re little anchors, holding fast to the moments of pure, unvarnished effort that we so quickly forget. They remind us that we are capable, we are here, and we are moving. What does your latest running photo say about you?
