I'm still buzzing from the 2022 World Games. Watching the athletes push themselves to the limit reminded me of my own competitive spirit. As a runner, I've experienced the thrill of crossing the finish line, but also the agony of falling short. This season was no exception. I trained tirelessly, but a nagging injury held me back. It was frustrating, but it also taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, it's okay to slow down. Just like a well-designed backyard pavilion can be the perfect spot to relax and unwind, I learned to appreciate the journey, not just the destination. As I watched the athletes receive their medals, I realized that the real victory was in the hard work and perseverance, not just the win. It was a humbling reminder to stay grounded and enjoy the ride.
