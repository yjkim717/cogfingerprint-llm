## The Curveball I Wasn't Expecting: Baseball, Loss, and Letting Go

Okay, 2022 has been...a year, right? For a lot of us. For me, a big chunk of it was wrapped up in the hope and heartbreak of the Philadelphia Phillies' playoff run. I’m not a *rabid* fan, but baseball has always been this comforting constant. My grandpa taught me to play, and summers were spent at dusty little leagues, the smell of hotdogs and freshly cut grass ingrained in my memory.

This year felt different. The Phillies were *good*. Really good. They clawed their way into the playoffs, and for a glorious few weeks, it felt like anything was possible. We were all swept up in the energy, the city buzzing with a palpable excitement I hadn't felt in years.

Then came the NLCS against the San Diego Padres. We won the first game. We were *so* close. But then...the momentum shifted. A series of frustrating errors, missed opportunities, and frankly, just plain bad luck, sent us spiraling. Game 5 was brutal. Watching it felt like watching a slow-motion train wreck.

It wasn’t just about losing a baseball game, though. It was about the weight of expectation, the sting of disappointment, and the sudden, quiet realization that even when you’ve put in the work, even when you believe, things don’t always go your way. It felt…personal, in a weird way.

And that’s what I’ve been processing. Life throws curveballs you just don’t see coming. You swing, you give it your all, and sometimes you strike out. It’s not about blaming yourself, or even the other team. It’s about recognizing that the outcome wasn't entirely within your control. It's about dusting yourself off, appreciating the good moments you *did* have, and getting ready for the next pitch.

Baseball season’s over, but I’m carrying that lesson with me. Because honestly, isn’t that what life is? A series of innings, some wins, some losses, and the constant need to adjust your swing?
