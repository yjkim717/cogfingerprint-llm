### The Agony of the Post-Game Text

You know the feeling. That electric buzz after a great game. For me, it was the 2022 summer league championship. I wasn’t the star, but I played my heart out. We lost by a single point in the final seconds, but the energy was incredible—a hard-fought battle where you leave everything on the court and share that look of mutual respect with your opponents.

In the locker room, still buzzing, I did the modern equivalent of asking for a number. I found the guy who guarded me all game—let’s call him Mark—and sent a follow-up message. “Hell of a game, man. You’re a beast on defense. Any teams looking for a guard for the fall season?”

The reply was almost instant: “Haha you too dude! Your crossover is filthy. I’ll let you know.”

I felt that surge of validation. It was a connection, a potential new teammate, a new chapter. But then, the dreaded **mixed signals** began. The next message I sent, asking if his team practiced locally, was **left on read**. Hours turned into a day. My **sports anxiety** kicked into overdrive. Was it something I said? Did I come on too strong? Maybe my game wasn’t as impressive as I thought. I replayed every pass, every shot, questioning my own **missteps** on and off the court.

It’s funny how the silence after a potential connection can be louder than the roar of a crowd. You’re just looking for a clear signal—a “yes, let’s talk” or a “no, thanks.” Instead, you’re stuck in the purgatory of an unopened message, your confidence slowly deflating like a forgotten basketball in the garage. It’s a special kind of loneliness, wondering if the camaraderie you felt was ever really there at all.
