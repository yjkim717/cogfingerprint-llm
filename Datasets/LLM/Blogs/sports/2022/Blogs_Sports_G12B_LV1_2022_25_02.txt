## That Uncanny Feeling: When Reality Blurs with the Screen

Something’s been stuck in my head lately. It started with rewatching *Major League* – and I swear, Skip Griparis looked *exactly* like a slightly more stressed-out version of Paul Rudd. Then I stumbled across *Icarus*, the Lance Armstrong documentary. And boom – Matt Damon's face kept popping up in my mind when I looked at Floyd Landis.

It's bizarre, right? This feeling of doppelgangers, of real people somehow mirroring characters we've seen on screen. Maybe it’s because we project narratives onto everything, even real-life athletes and scandals. Or maybe it’s just a trick of the light and our overactive imaginations. Either way, it makes you wonder how much we shape our perception of reality through the stories we consume. Anyone else notice this happening?



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
