**The Unexpected Frustration of a Perfect Game**

Seriously, 2022 was a weird year for sports, wasn’t it? I was completely hooked on college baseball, following my local team religiously. We were on a roll, a *really* good roll – almost felt like we were destined for a championship. Then, in the final inning, a missed catch. A simple error that completely derailed everything. It wasn’t just the loss, it was the *tracking* – the feeling of knowing we had it, then watching it slip away.  It’s a strangely similar feeling to that Depop update, honestly – a small change disrupting the flow of something you were enjoying.
