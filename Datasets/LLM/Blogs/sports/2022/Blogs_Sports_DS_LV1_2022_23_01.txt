There’s something special about the buzz in the air before a college football game—and for me, it’s not just about the players. As a longtime member of the Hawkeye Marching Band, I’ve come to see our trips as the heartbeat of the season. This year, with the Iowa-Iowa State rivalry—affectionately dubbed “El Assico”—back on the schedule, the energy is palpable. We’re packing buses, polishing horns, and mapping out our 2022 tour, from rivalry clashes to road trips. It’s more than just performing; it’s about tradition, camaraderie, and the shared pulse of the crowd. Win or lose, we bring the spirit, and that’s a feeling like no other.
