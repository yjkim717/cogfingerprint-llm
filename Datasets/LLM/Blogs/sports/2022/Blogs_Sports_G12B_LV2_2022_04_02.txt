Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone around sports, set in 2022, and approximately 98 words:

## The Unexpected Silence of the Crowd

Remember the buzz of 2022? Everywhere you looked, sports were *it*. I was glued to the World Cup, feeling every heartbreak and victory like my own. But something shifted. The roar of the crowd, usually so exhilarating, started to feel…distant. Like a memory fading. It made me realize how much I rely on that collective energy, that shared experience. Maybe it’s just growing up, but it’s a strange thing, this quiet appreciation for the game now, instead of the frenzy.



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
