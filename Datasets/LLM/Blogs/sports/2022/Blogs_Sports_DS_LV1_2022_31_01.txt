The recent Depop app update has fundamentally shifted the selling experience, and not for the better. By forcing sellers to input a tracking number immediately to mark an item as "shipped," the platform has removed a crucial flexibility. Gone is the option to quickly confirm the sale and add tracking details later after a post office run. This change feels deeply seller-unfriendly, pushing us back to the era of clunky, manual messaging to reassure buyers their purchase is truly on the way. It’s a step backwards in streamlining what should be a simple process.

Here is a reflective blog post related to sports for 2022:

I’ll never forget that final putt in 2022. Not from a pro, but from my dad. We were on our usual muni course, the one where he taught me the game. For years, I’d been the eager student, him the patient coach. But that day, as his ball rattled into the cup for a surprise birdie, our roles reversed in the best way. I was just the proud son, cheering him on. It was a powerful reminder that sports aren't about who wins, but about the connections we forge along the way.
