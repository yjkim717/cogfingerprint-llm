**Astros' Draft Haul: Can They Land Their Top Prospect, Ryan Clifford?**

As the 2022 MLB draft comes to a close, the Houston Astros are breathing a sigh of relief after making their selections. With a strong draft class, they've added some exciting young talent to their farm system. One player who caught everyone's attention is high school outfielder Ryan Clifford, who was widely regarded as one of the top prospects available. The Astros drafted Clifford with their second-round pick, and he's now their third-highest ranked prospect according to MLB Pipeline.

The big question on everyone's mind is: can the Astros afford to sign Clifford? The answer lies in their bonus pool situation. With a relatively modest first-round pick and a few other strategic selections, the Astros have managed to stay under their allocated bonus pool. This savvy draft strategy has given them the flexibility to sign their top prospects, including Clifford.

According to reports, the Astros have enough money left in their bonus pool to cover Clifford's expected signing bonus. This is a huge relief for the organization, as losing a top prospect like Clifford to a failure to sign would be a significant setback. The Astros have a history of developing young talent, and Clifford has the potential to be a key contributor to their future success.

Clifford is an exciting player with a lot of upside. A 17-year-old outfielder from Oklahoma, he's known for his impressive raw power and athleticism. With a strong swing and above-average speed, he's got the tools to become a dynamic player in the Astros' lineup down the road.

The Astros' ability to sign Clifford is a testament to their front office's shrewd management of their bonus pool. By being strategic with their draft picks and avoiding over-slotting, they've created the financial flexibility to sign their top prospects. This is a crucial aspect of building a successful farm system, as it allows them to retain their top talent and develop a strong foundation for the future.

As the Astros look to sign Clifford and their other draft picks, they're also thinking about the long-term implications of their 2022 draft class. With a mix of talented pitchers and position players, they've got a solid foundation to build on. The addition of Clifford to their outfield prospects is particularly exciting, as it gives them a deep and talented group of players to develop.

Of course, there are still some challenges ahead. The Astros will need to navigate the complexities of contract negotiations with Clifford and his agent. However, with a strong track record of signing their draft picks, they're well-equipped to handle these discussions.

In the end, the Astros' 2022 draft class is shaping up to be a huge success. With players like Ryan Clifford on board, they're well-positioned to build a strong farm system that will contribute to their competitive success for years to come. As the signing period heats up, Astros fans will be eagerly watching to see how their top prospects, including Clifford, develop and grow within the organization.
