It’s funny how traditions stick with you. Back in 2022, I got hooked on this quirky concept: the College Football Belt. It wasn't an official trophy, just a mythical title passed down like a family heirloom through wins. Whoever held it was the unofficial champion of champions.

That season, the Oregon Ducks were the kings of the hill. I remember watching them claw past a tough UCLA team to keep their grip on the belt. The stadium was electric—you could feel the weight of that silly, imaginary prize in every play. It wasn't just about one game; it was about defending a legacy, a story that stretched back decades.

Now, they’re set to face California. On paper, it’s just another conference game. But for those of us who followed the belt, it felt bigger. Could they hold the line? It made me think about sports at its best—not just the scores, but the narratives we build together. That belt was a reminder that sometimes, the most meaningful rivalries are the ones we invent ourselves.
