My jazz bass has been my workhorse for years, but I’ve always felt it was missing some of that thunderous low-end growl. The classic single-coils are articulate, but I crave the raw power of a mudbucker. My new project is a bit of a Frankenstein endeavor: I’m routing a cavity for a third pickup right near the bridge.

The real magic, however, won't be in the installation, but in the wiring. I'm planning to replace the standard volume knobs with a master volume and tone, and then install a 5-way rotary switch. This little dial will be the brain of the operation, letting me scroll through a library of tones—from the classic neck/middle combo to a series-wired humbucking mode, and finally, that soloed mudbucker setting for when I really need to shake the foundations. It’s an experiment in finding the ultimate voice for my bass.

### The Last-Minute Goal

It was the final game of our rec league season in 2022, and honestly, we were just playing for pride. The score was tied, and with only seconds left on the clock, a loose ball somehow found its way to my feet. In that split second, a lifetime of memories flashed by—the countless practices in the rain, the sting of previous losses, the sheer joy of a simple pass connecting perfectly.

I didn't even think. I just took the shot. Watching the ball hit the back of the net, the roar of my teammates rushing toward me—it was pure, unscripted magic. It wasn't about winning a championship; it was a reminder of why we play. For those fleeting moments where everything else disappears, and you're just a kid again, completely lost in the game. That feeling is what I'll carry with me long after the final whistle.
