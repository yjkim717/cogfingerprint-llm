## That Frustrating Feeling: When the Tech Fails You at the Finish

Ugh, anyone else ever feel like technology is actively conspiring against them? It happened to me last weekend during the final set of Wimbledon. I was *so* pumped to watch Tiafoe and Nadal – a proper clash of generations! I’d cleared my schedule, got comfy, and was ready to stream. But the darn app kept buffering. Seriously, during the crucial points!

I refreshed, restarted, checked my internet – the whole nine yards. It felt like the universe *didn't* want me to witness that incredible match.  Eventually, I gave up and just checked the score online. It’s a weird feeling, that frustration of wanting to experience something fully, but being thwarted by a glitch.  Made me appreciate the simple days of just watching on TV, I guess! Anyone else have similar tech fails during big sporting events?
