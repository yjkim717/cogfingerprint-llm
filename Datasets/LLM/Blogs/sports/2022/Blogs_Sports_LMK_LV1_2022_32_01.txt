**Kicking Off a New Season: A Conversation with the Faces of College Football**

As the summer of 2022 slowly gives way to the crisp air of fall, the world of college football is abuzz with excitement. The gridiron is set, the players are ready, and the fans are eagerly anticipating the kickoff of a new season. For those of us who live and breathe the sport, there's nothing quite like the thrill of watching our favorite teams battle it out on the field.

Recently, I had the chance to sit down with some of the most fascinating figures in the world of college football, courtesy of r/CFB Talks, a podcast that's rapidly become a must-listen for fans of the sport. Over the course of several upcoming episodes, hosts Joe Rexrode and Dan Mara will be chatting with a diverse range of guests, from academics to athletic administrators, about all things CFB.

One of the most intriguing conversations is with Dr. Kelly Damphousse, a renowned expert in the field of sports management. As the Director of the School of Hospitality, Tourism, and Event Management at Texas State University, Dr. Damphousse brings a unique perspective to the world of college athletics. His research has taken him into the heart of some of the most pressing issues facing sports administrators today, from athlete compensation to conference realignment.

As we discussed the upcoming season, Dr. Damphousse shared his thoughts on the evolving landscape of college football. "The sport is constantly changing," he observed. "From the impact of NIL policies to the rise of new conferences, there's a lot on the horizon that will shape the future of the game." For fans of the Tennessee Volunteers, this is particularly relevant, as the team navigates the complexities of the Southeastern Conference.

But it's not just the Power Five conferences that are worth watching. As Dan Mara, Commissioner of the Collegiate Sprint Football League (CSFL), noted during his conversation with Joe Rexrode, there's a rich and vibrant world of college football beyond the big-name programs. Sprint football, in particular, offers a unique blend of athleticism and strategy, with teams competing under a set of rules that emphasize speed and agility.

As I listened to these conversations, I couldn't help but think about the ways in which college football reflects and shapes our broader culture. From the pageantry of game day to the complex web of rules and regulations governing the sport, there's a lot more to CFB than meets the eye. And yet, at its core, it's still a game – one that brings people together, fosters community, and inspires us to be our best selves.

As the new season gets underway, I'm excited to see what the coming months have in store. Will the Tennessee Volunteers finally break through and make a deep run in the SEC? Can Texas State University continue to build on its recent successes? And what about the teams competing in the CSFL – will they be able to pull off any upsets against their more established counterparts?

Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: the world of college football is always full of surprises. And with guests like Dr. Kelly Damphousse, Joe Rexrode, and Dan Mara sharing their insights and expertise, r/CFB Talks is the perfect companion for fans looking to stay ahead of the curve. So grab a cup of coffee, tune in to the latest episode, and get ready to kick off a new season of college football.
