There I was in early 2022, scrolling through NBA highlights while bundled up against a particularly stubborn winter chill, when a ridiculous thought struck me: what if every team moved one degree of latitude north?

Suddenly, the Miami Heat became the balmy Jacksonville Jaunts, and the Minnesota Timberwolves were probably playing in a Canadian igloo. I laughed aloud, imagining the Toronto Raptors relocated to some remote, frostbitten outpost, forced to rename themselves the Moose Jaw Mammoths. It was pure, absurd humor, a welcome escape from the usual sports debates about trades and playoffs.

But it got me thinking about identity. A team’s name and location are so deeply woven into its soul. This silly mental exercise reminded me that while the jerseys and arenas might feel permanent, change is the one constant in life—and sometimes in sports, too. It was a lighthearted nudge to not take it all so seriously, to find joy in the "what-ifs" that connect us through shared laughter, no matter where we are on the map.
