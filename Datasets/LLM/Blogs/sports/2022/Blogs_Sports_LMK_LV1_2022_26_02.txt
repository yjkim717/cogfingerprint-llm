"As I dug through my grandfather's old baseball card collection in the summer of 2022, I couldn't help but wonder if it was worth grading some of the vintage cards. I've heard it can significantly boost their value, but it's not cheap. I'm torn between preserving the memories and potentially increasing their worth. For instance, a rare Babe Ruth card could be worth thousands if graded highly. I'm seeking advice on where to start - should I use a reputable service like Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) or consider alternatives? I'm curious to know what's the value threshold that makes grading worthwhile, and how to determine the potential value of my grandfather's collection."
