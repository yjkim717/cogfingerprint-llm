It’s wild to think about how quickly the 2022 season flew by, especially watching Michigan’s offense. Honestly, I was glued to the screen during those redzone drives. Seeing Harbaugh’s playcalling and the Wolverines consistently converting those crucial opportunities was a huge relief. Five touchdowns on five redzone possessions? That’s dominance! It felt like a sign of things to come, a testament to their focus and execution.  A really impressive start to the season, for sure.
