You know what still puzzles me from the 2022 NHL season? The faceoff. Our center would technically "win" the draw, but somehow the other team would skate away with the puck. Who really gets that win credit? It’s a reminder that in hockey, like life, initial victories don’t always mean you come out with true possession. It’s all about what you do next.
