**The Weight of the (Unofficial) Belt**

Okay, let’s be honest, we all secretly love the College Football Belt Trophy, right? It’s ridiculous, it’s a little silly, and it’s *completely* captivating. This year, it felt… different. Watching Oregon dismantle UCLA felt less like a regular game and more like a coronation. 

Seriously, the Ducks’ third consecutive win? It’s a statement. You can’t deny the swagger they’ve built, the consistent excellence. I remember last year, seeing that belt around their waist – it felt like a tangible representation of their relentless drive. 

There’s something fascinating about these “belt games,” isn’t there? It’s not about the actual trophy itself (though, let's be real, it’s a cool piece), but about the history, the rivalry, and the bragging rights. UCLA fought hard, no doubt, but Oregon just had that extra gear. 

It’s a reminder that in college football, sometimes the most fun is found in the traditions, the little competitions that add so much color to the season.  What do you think - who deserves the belt next year?
