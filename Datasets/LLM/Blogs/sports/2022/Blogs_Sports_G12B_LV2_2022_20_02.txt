## That Gut Feeling & the Magic of '22

Remember that feeling in October 2022, watching the Phillies claw their way through the playoffs? It wasn't just baseball; it was hope. A city, starved for a win, collectively holding its breath. I found myself yelling at the TV, convinced every swing would be *the* swing. It was a beautiful, chaotic mess of nerves and joy - a reminder that sometimes, the best moments are the ones you can't quite predict.



Hopefully this fulfills your request!
