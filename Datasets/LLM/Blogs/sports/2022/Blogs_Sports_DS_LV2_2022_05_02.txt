The final buzzer echoed through the empty arena, a sound I’d heard a thousand times, but this one felt different. It was March 2022, and after fifteen years, my old knees and I were officially retiring from pro basketball.

For weeks, a strange anxiety had been building. Who was I without the game? The rituals, the roar of the crowd—it was my entire identity. But during that last game, something shifted. Driving past a defender one final time, I wasn’t thinking about points or plays. I was just… playing. The pure, uncomplicated joy I felt at ten years old on a cracked neighborhood court came flooding back.

The game isn't leaving me; it’s just changing forms. My identity wasn't in the jersey, but in the love for the craft. And that’s something no retirement can ever take away.
