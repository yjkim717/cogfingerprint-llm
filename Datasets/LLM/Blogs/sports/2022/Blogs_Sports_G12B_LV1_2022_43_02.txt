>## The Weight of Expectation and a Late-Season Rally

Okay, so, I’m not a pro athlete. Far from it. But I’ve always poured myself into my local baseball team, the River City Rapids. This year, 2022, felt different. Everyone *expected* a playoff run. We had a strong starting lineup, a revamped bullpen, and the buzz around the city was palpable. 

For the first half of the season, we delivered. We were top of the division, and I genuinely believed we could go all the way. Then, August hit. A series of injuries, some brutal pitching collapses, and suddenly, we were sinking fast. The optimism drained, replaced by the collective groan of disappointed fans. 

Honestly, I started to lose hope too. But then, something shifted. A young pitcher, barely out of the minor leagues, stepped up. A veteran hitter found his swing again. They fought their way back, clawing for every run, every out. It wasn't pretty, but it was *real*. We didn't make the playoffs, but witnessing that late-season rally, that refusal to quit, reminded me that sometimes, the fight itself is more important than the victory. And that's a lesson I'll carry with me.
