## That Time My Bracket Officially Died (and I Loved It?)

Okay, let’s be honest. March Madness 2022 absolutely *wrecked* my bracket. Like, spectacularly. I was feeling pretty smug, predicting a comfortable run by [mention a popular team - e.g., Duke]. Then, *boom*. Saint Peter’s happened.

I remember watching their game against Kentucky, fully expecting the inevitable collapse. And they didn't. They just… kept winning. It felt surreal. I'm usually all about the favorites, the established powerhouses. But there was something genuinely thrilling about watching this underdog team defy all expectations. 

It was a good reminder, wasn't it? That sports, at their best, aren't about predictable outcomes. They're about the unexpected, the grit, and the sheer joy of seeing someone prove everyone wrong. My bracket was toast, sure, but witnessing that Saint Peter's run? That was a win in itself. It's a memory I’ll definitely cherish from 2022.
