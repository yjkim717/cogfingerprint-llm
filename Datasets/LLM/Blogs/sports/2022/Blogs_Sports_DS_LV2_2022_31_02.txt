The 2022 World Cup final felt like a fever dream. Messi and Mbappé trading blows, that heart-stopping penalty shootout. It was the ultimate tie-breaker, a battle for the title of football’s true people’s champion. I remember watching, breath held, thinking about all the backyard games decided by a sudden, solitary goal. That final wasn't just about a trophy; it was a mirror to every one of us who’s ever felt that glorious, gut-wrenching thrill of a game that hangs in the balance until the very last second.
