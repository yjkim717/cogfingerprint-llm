As I watched the 2022 sports highlights, I couldn't help but think of my childhood gaming sessions on the PS Classic. Just like how athletes perfect their game, I used to tweak my console with Autobleem and Retroboot to play a vast array of ROMs. The thrill of hacking into the system was exhilarating, much like the rush of a game-winning shot. Though I never thought I'd be nostalgic for modded consoles, it's amazing how some childhood joys stay with us. Who else is still retro-gaming in 2022?
