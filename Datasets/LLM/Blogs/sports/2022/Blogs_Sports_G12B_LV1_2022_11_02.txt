>## The Unexpected Wisdom of a Losing Season

Okay, so 2022 was… rough for my beloved Giants. Like, historically rough. We were laughing at the Jalen Hurts MVP campaign, genuinely believing we had a shot, and then… well, you know.

But something weird happened this year. Instead of just frustration, I found myself appreciating the little things. Like, the grit of a rookie lineman battling against a future Hall-of-Famer. Or the quiet determination in Daniel Jones’ eyes after a tough loss. 

It made me realize that sports aren't always about the wins and the championships. They're about witnessing human effort, resilience, and the stories unfolding along the way. Maybe a losing season can teach you more about the game – and about life – than a winning one ever could. Anyone else find unexpected lessons in the lows? Let me know in the comments – I need to feel less alone in this Giants fandom!
