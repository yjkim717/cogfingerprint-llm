## The Promise of Late Season Michigan

Something about Michigan’s early games this year just *felt* different. Watching those drives stall out in the redzone, it was a little frustrating. But then, seeing those five drives finally punch it in? It sparked a real hope. Maybe this Wolverines team, like so many before, truly peaks later. It’s a familiar feeling, isn’t it? That anticipation for what they’ll become. Here's to a strong finish, Wolverines!



I hope this captures the tone you were looking for! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
