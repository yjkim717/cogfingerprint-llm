It’s that bittersweet feeling again, isn’t it? Watching a team you’ve been rooting for stumble at the most important time. This year with the Jazz felt… fragile. You could see the flashes of brilliance from Mitchell, undeniable talent, but it felt like a defense struggling to hold together, a team relying too much on individual heroics. 

It’s a frustrating reminder that even the best players can’t single-handedly carry a team through the playoffs. Sometimes, it’s about the whole, the collective effort – a concept that seemed to slip away in 2022.  A disappointing end, but a valuable lesson, right?
