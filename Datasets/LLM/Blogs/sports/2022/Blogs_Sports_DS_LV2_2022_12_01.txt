That final buzzer in 2022 still echoes. We didn't win the championship, but in the locker room, something shifted. No blame, just quiet nods and tired smiles. We had left every ounce of effort on that court. I realized then that victory isn't just a score; it's the unspoken bond forged in shared struggle. That loss, strangely, felt like our biggest win. It taught us that our strength wasn't in never falling, but in who was there to pick you up. A lesson far greater than any trophy.
