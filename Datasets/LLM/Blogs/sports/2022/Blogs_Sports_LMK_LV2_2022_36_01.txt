Here's a reflective blog post on the topic:

"As I watched post-game interviews from the 2022 NBA season, I noticed something that struck a chord. Some players were quick to deflect praise, not with self-deprecating humor, but with genuine humility. They credited their teammates and coaches, showcasing a refreshing display of sportsmanship. It's a quality that's often lost in the spotlight, but it's what elevates a team from good to great. As fans, we're drawn to confident players, but it's the humble ones who truly inspire. Let's appreciate the unsung heroes of the NBA, and the attitude that makes them champions."
