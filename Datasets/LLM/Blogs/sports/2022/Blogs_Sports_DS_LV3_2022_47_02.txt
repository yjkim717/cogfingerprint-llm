The final buzzer echoed through the empty arena, a sound I’d heard a thousand times, but this one felt different. It was 2022, and after 15 seasons, my body was finally waving the white flag. The contract on the table was for one last year, a victory lap. But the real negotiation was with myself.

Could I still give my all, knowing my heart wasn't fully in the chase for another championship? Or was the greatest loyalty to the game knowing when to pass the torch? Stepping away isn't a forfeit; it's a profound respect for the sport that shaped you. It’s trusting that the lessons learned on the court will guide you in the next chapter of life.
