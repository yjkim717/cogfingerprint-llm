## The Unexpected Wisdom of Sprint Football and the People Steering the Ship

It’s November 2022. The air’s got that crisp bite that promises woodsmoke and the slow, inevitable slide into winter. And, predictably, college football is consuming my every waking thought. We're deep into the season, the playoff picture is starting to take shape (and causing predictable levels of hand-wringing), and the usual debates are raging – conference realignment, NIL, the transfer portal… the whole shebang.

But this year, something slightly different happened that shifted my perspective a little. I stumbled across an announcement for a series of “CFB Talks,” a new initiative bringing together leaders and thinkers in the college sports world.  The lineup was interesting – a university president, a respected sports journalist (Joe Rexrode, I recognized the name!), and even the commissioner of the Collegiate Sprint Football League (CSFL). The CSFL?  Honestly, I'd barely heard of it.

Sprint football. The name itself sounds… quirky, right?  It’s a version of college football played with smaller rosters and, crucially, players who weigh under 185 pounds.  It's a fascinating, often overlooked, corner of the college sports world, primarily played on the East Coast. My initial reaction was a shrug.  *Another* niche league? What could *that* possibly teach me about the sprawling, billion-dollar machine that is Division I football?

Turns out, quite a lot.

I ended up watching a recording of one of the CFB Talks, featuring the CSFL commissioner. He wasn’t talking about recruiting rankings or NIL deals. He was talking about access. About providing opportunities for athletes who might not fit the traditional mold, who might not be projected for the NFL, but who still crave the camaraderie, the competition, and the discipline of team sports. He spoke about how sprint football fostered a different kind of athlete – one focused on technique, strategy, and endurance, rather than sheer size and power.

And that’s when it hit me.  We’re so caught up in the spectacle, the hype, and the increasingly complex business of big-time college football that we often forget *why* we fell in love with the game in the first place. It was about the teamwork, the dedication, the shared pursuit of a goal. Somewhere along the way, that purity got diluted.

Hearing this commissioner speak, I started thinking about the people *leading* college sports, beyond the coaches and the star players. I’d been grumbling, like many fans, about conference realignment – schools jumping ship for more money, leaving longtime rivals in their wake. It felt… cynical.  Like the whole thing had become a chess match played with universities as pawns.

Then I remembered reading an interview with the Texas State president, also a speaker in the CFB Talks. He was talking about balancing the university’s mission
