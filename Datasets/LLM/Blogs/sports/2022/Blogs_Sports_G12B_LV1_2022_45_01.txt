>## The Annual Westbrook Watch: Who Really Paid the Price?

Okay, let's be honest, for the last few seasons, a certain time of year has become synonymous with a specific kind of sports anxiety: Westbrook watch. You know, that period in October/November where Russell Westbrook seems to be operating on a different basketball planet than everyone else. It’s become almost…predictable.

We all remember the early days in Washington. The Wizards fans, initially excited by the hometown hero, quickly witnessed a disjointed offense and a frustratingly inconsistent Westbrook. Then came the Lakers experiment, where the promise of a championship contender dissolved into a chaotic mess, partially fueled by those initial struggles. And now, with the 2022-23 season underway with the Clippers, the familiar questions are swirling again.

It's fascinating, isn't it? A player with undeniable talent, a ferocious drive, and a history of triple-doubles, yet consistently battling this slow start. But here's what's really been on my mind: which team truly *suffered* the most during these “Worstbrook” phases? 

Washington had the benefit of being a smaller market, the expectations arguably lower. The Lakers, with their championship pedigree and LeBron James, felt the heat even more intensely. And now, the Clippers, already navigating a complex roster, are hoping to avoid the dreaded early-season Westbrook slump.

It’s a compelling narrative, and one that continues to captivate and frustrate basketball fans alike. Let’s just hope this year, the Westbrook watch leads to something more positive than we’ve seen in recent years.
