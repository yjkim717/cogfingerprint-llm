>## The Jazz and the Weight of Expectation

Okay, so let's be honest, Jazz fans. We've been riding a wave of cautious optimism for a while now, haven't we? The Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert pairing felt like a solid foundation. But as we head into the 2022 playoffs, a nagging feeling persists. 

It’s not about a lack of talent – those guys are stars. It's about consistency, especially when the pressure's on. We've seen flashes of brilliance, sure, but also frustrating collapses, particularly in those nail-biting, late-game scenarios. And defensively? While Gobert is a force, the overall scheme seems to lack that playoff-stopping intensity.

Maybe it's just the weight of expectation, the feeling that we *should* be further along. But until the Jazz can consistently deliver in the clutch, that feeling, and those anxieties, are likely to linger. Here's hoping for a surprise, but I'm tempering my excitement this year.
