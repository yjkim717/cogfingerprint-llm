**The Pursuit of ‘Good Enough’ – And Why It’s Killing the Joy**

Remember 2022? It felt like everyone was chasing the *perfect* setup, didn’t it?  I saw it everywhere, especially in the running world. Guys obsessing over splits, meticulously tracking every stride, and agonizing over the *exact* shoe for every single race. It reminded me a little of that whole class D amplifier debate – a longing for something supremely efficient, but often at the expense of… well, everything else.

I used to be one of those runners. I’d spend hours researching gels, analyzing my pace, and stressing about hydration.  I was so focused on optimizing that I started to forget *why* I was running in the first place. The joy of the open road, the feeling of pushing my limits, the simple act of moving my body – it got buried under a mountain of data and self-doubt.

It took a humbling 5k where I just... ran.  No watches, no calculations, just me and the pavement. And you know what? I felt *better*. 

Maybe it’s similar with audio equipment.  We get so caught up in the specs and the price tags, we lose sight of the music itself.  Sometimes, ‘good enough’ – a decent setup that brings a smile to your face – is far more rewarding than chasing an unattainable ideal.
