**The Unexpected Shift: Why I Went Back to Basics This Season**

Okay, so 2022 was… weird. I’d been absolutely locked into competitive cycling, pushing myself relentlessly, chasing that next PB. I was all about the latest tech – fancy power meters, aerodynamic skinsuits, the whole shebang. I was convinced the newest gear was the *only* way to improve. It felt a bit like trying to dual-boot Windows 11 onto a machine built for Windows 7 – forcing something incompatible to work.

Then, halfway through the season, something shifted. I started feeling burned out, honestly. The constant data crunching, the relentless optimization… it was exhausting. I realized I’d become so focused on the *tools* that I’d forgotten *why* I loved cycling in the first place.

So, I made a radical decision. I stripped back everything. No fancy gadgets, just my trusty old bike, a basic kit, and a renewed focus on the feel of the road beneath my wheels. 

It was surprisingly liberating. I started noticing subtle improvements – better pacing, smoother transitions, a deeper connection with the ride. It wasn’t about the data; it was about the experience. 

It’s a little like realizing you need to carefully partition your SSD – you need to remove the unnecessary to make space for what truly matters. Sometimes, the best performance comes from simplifying, not complicating.  This season, I rediscovered the joy of just *riding*.
