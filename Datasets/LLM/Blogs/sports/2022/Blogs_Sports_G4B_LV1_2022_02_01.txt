**Blog Post: Snowblower Blues & the Grit of Competition**

It’s funny, isn’t it?  Right now, I'm obsessing over a stubborn John Deere 332 – a diesel engine refusing to deliver its usual power.  Seriously battling a clogging issue before a predicted blizzard! It’s made me think about sports, specifically my high school basketball team last year. We were down by ten with two minutes left, and it felt like the power was just…gone.  Just like that snowblower, we needed a surge.  That grit, that refusal to give up – that’s what got us back in it.  Sometimes, it’s about finding that extra gear, just like diagnosing a stubborn machine.

The rain always seemed to follow us to the soccer field. 2022 was particularly brutal – muddy, relentless, and honestly, disheartening. We lost a crucial regional game, and the feeling of defeat was heavy. But looking back, I realize it wasn’t just *losing* that stung. It was the lack of fight, the quiet acceptance of failure. I started journaling that season, focusing on the small victories – a good pass, a smart tackle – to rebuild my mental strength.  It taught me that resilience isn’t about avoiding the rain, but about finding your footing in it.
