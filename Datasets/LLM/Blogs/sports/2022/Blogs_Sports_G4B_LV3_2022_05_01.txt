**The Cavalry Charge – And Why It Still Gets Me**

Okay, real talk – I still get a serious jolt of frustration watching a well-executed cavalry rush in *NBA 2K22*. Seriously, there’s something about those coordinated drives to the basket, spearheaded by a Cav Cavalry (I know, weird analogy!) that just feels… overwhelming. 

I’ve spent countless hours battling teams that completely dominate with that strategy. It’s not just about the points; it’s the feeling of being completely outmaneuvered.  It reminds me of needing to adapt, to find a new angle, a different way to counter the obvious.  Maybe that’s why I love the game – the constant challenge to shift your approach.
