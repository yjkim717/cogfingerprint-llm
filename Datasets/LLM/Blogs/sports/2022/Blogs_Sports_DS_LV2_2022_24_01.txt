The whistle blew, and just like that, my final high school soccer season was over in the fall of 2022. We didn't win the championship; we lost in the semi-finals. For days, I was crushed, replaying every missed pass in my head.

But then my coach said something that stuck with me: "Don't let the final score define the entire season."

He was right. I started thinking less about that last game and more about the bus rides filled with laughter, the 6 a.m. practices where we watched the sun rise together, and the incredible feeling of a perfect through-ball to a teammate. The sport gave me a family and taught me about resilience. The loss still stings, but now I see it as just one chapter in a much richer story—a story I’m incredibly grateful to have been a part of.
