**Finding My Flow: It’s More Than Just the Workout**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 felt like a year of chasing momentum. Between work, family, and trying to actually *enjoy* my downtime, it was easy to get swept away in the ‘doing’ and forget about the ‘being.’ But lately, I’ve been really trying to shift my perspective, and it’s started with my mornings.

It wasn’t a dramatic overnight change, but slowly, I’ve built a routine that feels… good. It starts with a solid workout – usually something that gets my heart pumping, and then a huge smoothie packed with ingredients like beet root powder (seriously, it’s a game changer for recovery!). 

Honestly, the smoothie is almost a ritual. But it's more than just a drink; it’s a moment to center myself.  I used to just gulp something down and bolt out the door, but now I take a few deep breaths, really *taste* it, and feel the energy settle in. 

It’s funny, because I realized that the biggest gains aren’t always in the gym. They’re in the little intentional moments, like prioritizing a mindful recovery after a tough session. It’s about building a routine that supports *me*, not just my fitness goals.  What are your go-to rituals for feeling grounded?
