The drama that unfolded on /r/CFB this week was a wild ride. For those who may not be familiar, /r/CFB is one of the most active college football subreddits out there. So, when Reddit admins stickied a post on the sub, it naturally got a lot of attention. The problem was, the stickied post was... quite spammy. It was a generic "let's discuss the latest news" kind of post, but it was awkwardly phrased and didn't really add anything new to the conversation.

The real kicker was that the admins' decision to sticky this post resulted in the removal of a previous sticky, which had been carefully curated by the subreddit moderators. The mods had clearly put thought into what they wanted to feature, and the admins just... overrode that. It raised some eyebrows about mod permissions and who gets to decide what's important. As a fan, it was jarring to see the usual flow of the sub disrupted. The whole ordeal left me wondering: who really runs the show on Reddit? Is it the admins, or the moderators who are actually on the ground, managing their subs day in and day out?
