"As the 2022 NBA playoffs approached, Jazz fans were left underwhelmed. Despite Donovan Mitchell's impressive individual skills, the team's overall performance fell short.

As the season wraps up, it's clear the Jazz must address these weaknesses to make a deeper playoff run next year. Can they make the necessary adjustments to turn the tide?"
