"From Couch to Marathon: My Unlikely Running Journey"

I'll be the first to admit, 2022 wasn't exactly the year I had envisioned for myself. The pandemic had long since worn off its initial novelty, and I found myself stuck in a rut, both physically and mentally. That was until I laced up my sneakers and decided to train for a marathon. It wasn't a sudden epiphany, but rather a gradual realization that I needed a challenge. As I progressed from couch to 5K to eventually tackling my first 26.2 miles, I discovered a newfound appreciation for the quiet moments â€“ the early morning runs, the rhythmic pounding of my feet, and the sense of accomplishment that came with each small milestone. Running became my therapy, my escape, and my passion. And as I crossed that finish line, I knew that this was just the beginning of my journey.
