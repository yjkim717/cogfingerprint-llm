It’s 2022, and I keep thinking about Jaylen Nowell. Night after night, I watch the box scores, and something jumps out: when he logs 20+ minutes, this team just wins. It’s not a fluke.

He brings a spark off the bench—a fearless three-point shooter who isn't afraid to create his own shot. Yet, too often, he's tagged with a "DNP" or gets buried in a crowded rotation. I get it, coaching is about tough choices. But sometimes the numbers tell a story you can't ignore. Giving a hot hand more run isn't just a hunch; it feels like unlocking a weapon we already have. I just hope the staff sees it, too, before another winnable game slips away.
