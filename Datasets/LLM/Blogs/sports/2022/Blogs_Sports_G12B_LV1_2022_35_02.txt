## The Long Game: Finding My Feet (and My Age Group) in 2022

Okay, let's be honest. 2022 felt… heavy. For everyone, I think.  The pandemic hangover was real, the news cycle was relentless, and just navigating daily life felt like a mini-marathon in itself.  But amidst all the noise, I found something grounding, something that kept pulling me back to a sense of calm and purpose: running.

I wasn't always a runner.  In fact, up until my early thirties, exercise was largely synonymous with "avoidance."  I’d dabble in gym memberships I’d never use, and occasionally force myself on a treadmill for a torturous 20 minutes. It never *stuck*. Then, a few years ago, a friend casually suggested a 5k. I laughed. I sputtered. I said I’d rather wrestle a badger. But she persisted, and eventually, I signed up.

That 5k was… humbling.  I walked a significant portion of it. I felt like I was going to die. But something clicked. There was a weird satisfaction in crossing that finish line, even if I was near the back of the pack.  And that feeling, that tiny spark of accomplishment, was enough to make me want to do it again.

Fast forward to 2022, and I was… well, I was *running*. Regularly.  Not chasing records, not aiming for elite times, just… running. I'd built up to a comfortable base mileage – a solid 20-25 miles a week – and was even starting to enjoy longer distances.  The thing is, I'm now firmly in the 'masters' category. (Don't look it up; it's more depressing than you think!)  And that realization brought a whole new layer of complexity to my training.

Suddenly, it wasn’t just about how fast I could run a mile. It was about *durability*. It was about listening to my body, recognizing the difference between a tough workout and an injury waiting to happen.  It was about accepting that recovery was just as important – maybe even *more* important – than the miles themselves.

I remember a conversation I had with a more experienced runner last spring. He said something that really resonated with me: "It’s not about peak performance anymore. It's about the long game. It's about staying healthy and consistent, year after year
