## The Unexpected Joy of Small Victories

2022 felt… unpredictable, didn't it? For me, finding consistency in running became a grounding force. It wasn't about smashing world records, but celebrating those little personal bests – shaving seconds off a mile, finally conquering that hill, just *showing up* on days I didn't feel like it. Sharing those wins in online running communities was incredible too. The encouragement, the shared struggles... it built a real sense of belonging. It reminded me that progress, however small, is still progress, and that’s something worth celebrating.
