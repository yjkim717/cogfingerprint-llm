It’s late in the fourth quarter, and I can’t help but hold my breath. Watching the Utah Jazz in the 2022 playoffs felt like seeing the same heartbreaking movie on repeat. Donovan Mitchell, ball in hand, ready to create magic—but the defense knew it was coming. Our offense became too predictable in those final minutes, and the defensive intensity we prided ourselves on just… faded.

It’s tough as a fan, seeing such a talented team struggle when it matters most. We had the pieces, but in crunch time, isolation plays and defensive lapses left us exposed. Here’s hoping next season brings a new script—one with resilience when the pressure’s on.
