>## The Rookie Card Conundrum: Scott and the Ghosts of Baseball Dreams

Okay, baseball card collectors, let's dive into something that’s been swirling around in my head (and probably yours too) – the true definition of a rookie card. Specifically, I’ve been thinking about Scott, a player who always held a special place in my collection.

He debuted in 1996, a flash in the pan really, but it was 1997 when he *exploded* onto the scene. Suddenly, everyone was talking about him. But does that 1996 card, the one I snagged at a local card show, truly count as his rookie? 

It's a surprisingly thorny question! He was a prospect, sure, but a full-fledged MLB player? That's the debate. The Topps series from '96 includes him, but does that make it *the* rookie? 

Collecting baseball cards isn't just about owning pieces of cardboard; it's about chasing memories, reliving moments, and connecting with the stories of the game. And sometimes, those stories are a little complicated, like deciding if Scott’s first appearance on a card is the *real* beginning of his legend. Anyone else wrestle with these collecting quandaries?
