>## The Weekend League Struggle is Real (and How I Finally Found Some Peace)

Okay, let's be honest. The FIFA Weekend League in 2022 was a *thing*. It felt like everyone was playing the same ultra-aggressive meta – endless high pressure, swarming midfielders, and a frantic, almost chaotic pace. I was getting demolished. Seriously, my win rate plummeted, and I was starting to feel like I needed a stress ball just to load the game.

I tried everything. Defensive depth, low blocks… nothing seemed to stick. Then, out of frustration, I started experimenting. I widened my formation, giving my full-backs more space to operate, and, surprisingly, I started tinkering with the camera settings. A little zoom out, a wider field of view – suddenly, I could actually *see* what was happening!

It sounds silly, but it made a huge difference. Being able to anticipate runs and track players became so much easier. The high pressure still came, but I was better equipped to deal with it. It wasn't a magic bullet, of course, but it brought a much-needed sense of control back to my Weekend League experience. Sometimes, the smallest adjustments can make the biggest impact.



Hope this helps!
