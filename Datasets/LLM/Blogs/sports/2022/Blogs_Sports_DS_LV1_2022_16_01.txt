It’s funny how traditions take on a life of their own. I was thinking about this the other day while scrolling through college football chatter. There’s this unofficial title floating around out there—the “College Football Belt.” It’s not a physical trophy you’ll see on a shelf, but an idea, a lineage. Whoever holds it is, in essence, the current king of the hill.

And right now, that’s Oregon. They’re sitting on it during their bye week, but you know they can feel the target on their backs. Next up? A trip to face UCLA. It’s a strange kind of pressure, defending something that isn’t even tangible. It reminds me that in sports, the most meaningful stakes are often the ones we create ourselves. It’s not just about a win or a loss; it’s about upholding a story, a chain of champions that stretches back years. For the Ducks, this isn’t just another game—it’s about keeping their name in that unique and fleeting history.
