## The Missed Connection & the Final Buzzer

It’s funny, isn’t it, how different platforms work? I was thinking about it watching the Celtics’ playoff run this year. Android users – seemingly effortlessly – could follow game updates, share reactions, and coordinate watch parties all through Google Messages, a centralized hub. My iPhone? A scattered mess of notifications and group chats across various apps.

It felt like a missed connection. Like we, as fans, *could* be experiencing the collective excitement even more seamlessly. That final buzzer against the Warriors? It would have been electric with unified messaging! Maybe Apple will catch up, but for now, I'll keep refreshing.
