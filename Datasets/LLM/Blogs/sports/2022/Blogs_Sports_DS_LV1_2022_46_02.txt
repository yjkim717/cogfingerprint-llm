There’s something uniquely cruel about being knocked out of the NFL playoffs, only to watch the team that beat you hoist the Lombardi Trophy a few weeks later. As a lifelong fan of a team that’s been on the wrong side of that story more than once, I can tell you—it stings. It’s like you were just a speed bump on their road to glory.

Looking back at the 2022 season, I think of all the hopeful fanbases whose dreams were dashed by the eventual champion. For them, the Super Bowl wasn’t a celebration; it was a painful replay of what could’ve been. There’s a strange, bittersweet honor in it, though—your team didn’t just lose to anyone. They fell to the best. But in the quiet of the offseason, that’s little consolation for what might have been.
