As I watched the 2022 NBA playoffs, I was struck by the resilience of athletes who overcome obstacles. Like a DoorDash driver facing an unresponsive customer, they adapt and persevere. When a star player is injured, the team must adjust their strategy. It's a reminder that in sports and life, flexibility is key. By embracing the unexpected, we can still achieve our goals, even when the game doesn't go as planned.
