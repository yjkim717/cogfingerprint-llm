As I laced up my running shoes for a post-booster shot recovery jog in the summer of 2022, I couldn't shake off the nagging headache. Reaching for Tylenol seemed like a quick fix, but my mind wandered to my tinnitus. I'd been managing the condition for years, but the thought of exacerbating it with painkillers was unsettling. Was the temporary relief worth the potential long-term ear damage? I decided to tough it out, opting for a gentle jog instead.
