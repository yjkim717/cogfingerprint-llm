The Rookie Card Conundrum: A Blast from the Past. As I dug through my old baseball card collection, I stumbled upon a 1996 Topps card featuring Scott, a player who made his MLB debut that year. It got me thinking - is this his true rookie card? With the rise of Bowman and other secondary brands, the definition of a "rookie card" has become murky. For Scott, Topps was the first to feature him, but what about players who debuted in later rounds or had earlier Bowman cards? As a collector, it's fascinating to see how the hobby has evolved. In 2022, we're spoiled for choice with autographs, parallels, and inserts galore. Still, there's something special about holding a card from a player's inaugural season. For Scott, that 1996 Topps card remains iconic â€“ a snapshot of his first foray into the big leagues.
