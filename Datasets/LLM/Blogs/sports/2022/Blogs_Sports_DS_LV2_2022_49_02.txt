You know, it’s funny—I was scrolling through old wrestling forums the other day, and someone asked fans to rank OSW Review’s storyarcs. It took me right back to the Hulkamania and WCW days, when wrestling wasn’t just a show; it felt like a weekly drama we all lived through. In 2022, with so much content vying for our attention, those classic arcs remind me why I fell in love with sports storytelling: raw emotion, unforgettable characters, and shared memories that stick with you for life.
