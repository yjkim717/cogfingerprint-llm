**The Day Reddit Tried to Fix the Game (and Messed It Up)**

You know those moments in sports where you just *feel* like the rules are being bent, or maybe even broken? It’s frustrating, right? Well, I experienced a weird version of that last month, and it involved Reddit and a college football subreddit. 

Apparently, a Reddit admin – bless their heart – accidentally stuckied a spam post. Now, I don’t follow every single subreddit out there, but the fallout was huge. Valuable comments, genuinely insightful discussions about the team, were all buried under a promotional post for something completely irrelevant. 

It felt like a massive fumble, a disruption to the flow of conversation. It made me think about how precious those online communities can be – spaces where fans connect over a shared passion.  A simple mistake, a tiny error, and suddenly the whole thing was thrown off. 

It’s a reminder that even in the digital world, things can go sideways, and sometimes the best response is just to step back and let the real conversations breathe.  What's *your* biggest frustration with online fandom?
