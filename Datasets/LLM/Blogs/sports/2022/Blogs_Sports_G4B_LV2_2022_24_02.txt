**The Shot I Couldn't Seem to Make**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single moment can stick with you, even years later. Last fall, I was really pushing myself with my basketball – trying to get back into shape after a pretty sedentary 2022. I was working on my three-point shot, something I used to nail consistently, but suddenly felt completely out of reach. 

I’d practice for hours, meticulously adjusting my form, visualizing success. Yet, every shot felt… off. Short. Wide. It was incredibly frustrating. I started doubting everything, questioning my technique, even my motivation. 

It took a conversation with my coach – he just said, "Sometimes you just need to step back and let your muscle memory take over.”  And you know what? He was right. I stopped forcing it and just started playing, letting the shots come naturally. 

It wasn't an instant fix, but slowly, steadily, the rhythm returned. It reminded me that sometimes, the biggest challenges aren't about brute force, but about trusting the process.  Just like that Windows USB boot issue – persistence and a little patience often win the day.
