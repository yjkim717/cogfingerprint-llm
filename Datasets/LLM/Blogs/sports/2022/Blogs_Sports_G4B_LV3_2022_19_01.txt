**The Quiet Revolution of My Mornings**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 felt like a year of just *doing*. Work, emails, the endless scroll… it all blurred together. I realized I wasn’t really *living*, let alone thriving. Then, I started messing around with my mornings. It wasn’t about becoming a super-athlete overnight, it was about building something… solid.

It started with a discipline I hadn't realized I craved. Just getting out of bed before my phone – a battle in itself! – and then moving into a short, focused workout. Nothing crazy, just 30 minutes of movement to kickstart my body and mind. 

But it’s more than just the sweat. I’ve been really intentional about hydration – a big glass of water first thing is non-negotiable. And honestly, the recovery part is what’s surprised me the most. Foam rolling, stretching, even just a few minutes of mindful breathing. It’s about recognizing my body’s needs and giving it what it deserves. 

I’m not saying this is a magic bullet, but it's created a space for me to feel more centered and prepared for whatever the day throws my way. It’s a quiet revolution, really – reclaiming those early hours and building a foundation for a more intentional life.  What small changes have you been making to prioritize your well-being?
