>## The Unexpected Sting of a Checkmate (and a Few Harsh Words)

Okay, I admit it. I'm not a chess grandmaster. I dabble on Chess.com, mostly to keep my brain ticking. Lately, though, something's been bothering me. Losing is part of the game, absolutely. But the dismissive comments after a close match? The "lol ez" and thinly veiled mockery? It stings more than the actual loss. 

It's a weird feeling, right? In 2022, with all the online connection we have, why the need to be unnecessarily unkind? It’s a reminder that even in a game of strategy, human interaction can be surprisingly… rough. Maybe I just need to focus on the game and mute those salty opponents!
