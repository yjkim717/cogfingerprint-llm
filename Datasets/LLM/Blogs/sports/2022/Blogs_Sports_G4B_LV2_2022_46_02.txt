**The Ghosts of Playoffs Past**

It’s funny how the NFL playoffs can linger, isn’t it? Even now, as we’re wrapping up 2022, I still find myself thinking about teams that *almost* were. Not just the heartbreaking losses, but the quiet, almost ghostly presence of teams that were so close to glory – only to be felled by the eventual Super Bowl winner. 

I was digging through some historical data recently, really trying to understand the weight of those playoff eliminations. It’s not just about the final score, you know? It’s about the *feeling*. It’s about watching a team build momentum, fueled by a passionate fanbase, and then… *poof* – gone. Eliminated by a team destined for greatness.

Think about the 2021 49ers, for example. They were a force, a legitimate Super Bowl contender. But the Rams, with their incredible defense, just… shut them down. It was a brutal reminder that in the NFL, one game can change everything. 

What really struck me was how often these “ghosts” – the teams that fell short – keep showing up in our memories. We talk about them, we analyze what went wrong, and we wonder “what if?” 

It’s a strangely comforting thing, I think. It means those teams, those seasons, mattered. They left a mark. And maybe, just maybe, that shared experience of heartbreak and near-misses is what truly binds us together as NFL fans. 

Do you have a playoff memory that still sticks with you? Let me know in the comments!

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way (e.g., add a specific example, adjust the tone, or focus on a particular aspect)?
