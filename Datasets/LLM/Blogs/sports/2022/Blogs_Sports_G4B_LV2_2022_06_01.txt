**The Weight of the Shot**

Remember Ben Simmons in 2022? It felt… heavy, didn’t it? Watching him try to force things, the incredible athleticism battling against a glaring weakness – the shot. It’s a frustrating thing to witness, seeing a player with so much raw talent struggle with such a fundamental skill. 

I think a lot of us have felt that pressure of needing to be “good” at something, and how that can sometimes push us into uncomfortable, even detrimental, habits. Simmons’ story really highlighted that. 

It wasn’t about erasing his drive; it was about finding a balance. Maybe the key isn't always about the flashiest move, but about mastering the basics – a reliable free throw, a focused drive. It’s a reminder that growth isn’t always linear, and sometimes the most impactful changes come from refining what you already have.
