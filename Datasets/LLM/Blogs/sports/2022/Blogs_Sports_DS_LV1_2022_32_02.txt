Of all the places to find a moment of clarity, I didn’t expect it on a sun-drenched, slightly chilly field in Collegeville, Minnesota. It was September 3rd, 2022. The world felt, as it often did that year, a little frayed at the edges. We were all still figuring out the new rhythms of a post-(or at least, living-with-) pandemic life, navigating a strange blend of normalcy and lingering uncertainty. And into that space, like a grounding force, stepped the simple, brutal, and beautiful game of Division III football.

I was there to watch my alma mater, the UW-Whitewater Warhawks. We’re a dynasty in our little corner of the sports universe, a program built on a foundation of discipline and a relentless, almost mechanical, will to win. Coming to play the Saint John’s Johnnies in their own house is never a picnic; it’s one of those storied non-conference matchups that feels bigger than the sum of its parts. It’s a test of metal, right out of the gate.

The first half was exactly the kind of trench warfare we’d expected. A gritty 10-10 stalemate. Our Warhawks were doing what they do—methodical, physical, imposing their structure. The Johnnies were right there with us, punch for punch. It felt like a typical heavyweight bout between two blue-blood D-III programs. You could feel the collective anticipation in the stands, the sense that this would be a fifteen-round fight decided by who blinked last.

Then came the second half. And with it, the lesson.

It wasn't a flashy, highlight-reel play that changed the game. It was something far more profound: an adjustment. You could almost see it happening in real-time. The Saint John’s defense, which had been solid but yielding, suddenly seemed to be playing a different game. They started anticipating our routes, filling gaps before our offensive line could create them, and swarming to the ball carrier with a kind of synchronized purpose that was breathtaking to watch. It was as if they had downloaded our playbook during halftime.

Our drives, which had been sustained marches in the first half, began to sputter and die. Three-and-out. A punt. An interception. The Warhawk machine, so precise and dependable, was suddenly seizing up. And with every defensive stop, the Johnnies’ offense gained a little more swagger, a little more field position, and eventually, the points that would put the game out of reach. The final score, 24-10, told a story of two halves: one of parity, and one of pure, unadulterated domination born from a smarter plan.

As I drove the long, darkening road back to Wisconsin, the loss stung, sure. But more than that, I was captivated by what I had witnessed. In an era where we’re obsessed with raw talent—the 5-star recruit, the 40-yard-dash time, the cannon for an arm—this game was a powerful testament to the enduring power of the mind.

Football, especially at this level where no one is playing for a million-dollar contract, is the ultimate team chess match. Those Saint John’s coaches saw a problem in the first half. They diagnosed it, communicated it, and their players executed the solution with flawless trust. That’s not just coaching; that’s teaching. And the players’ ability to absorb that new information under the intense pressure of a season opener and then perform it? That’s not just athleticism; that’s a rare and valuable form of intelligence.

It got me thinking about adaptability, a concept that felt incredibly relevant in 2022. We’d all spent the last few years having to adjust. To pivot. To learn new ways of working, connecting, and living. Some of us adapted well; others struggled, trying to force the old game plan onto a fundamentally changed field.

The Johnnies that day were a masterclass in adaptation. They didn’t have better athletes than Whitewater. I’d argue, on paper, we probably had the edge. What they had was a better *process* for problem-solving in the moment. They weren’t rigid. They were fluid. They saw the game evolving and evolved with it, while we, for one critical half, remained stuck in our initial, now-obsolete, approach.

There’s a humility in that, I think. A willingness to admit that your first idea might not be your best one, and the courage to change course. It’s a lesson that extends far beyond the gridiron. It applies to our careers, our relationships, our personal growth. The world is going to throw second-half adjustments at you. The question is, will you keep running the same plays that worked in the first quarter, or will you have the awareness and the guts to change your defense?

So, thank you, Saint John’s Johnnies. Thank you for a tough, well-earned victory. And thank you for a reminder that sometimes, the most powerful force in sports—and in life—isn’t just strength or speed, but the quiet, collective intelligence to see the board differently and the courage to make the move. It was a loss for my Warhawks, but it felt like a win for the soul of the game.
