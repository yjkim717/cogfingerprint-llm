I still remember the harsh winter of 2022 when my trusty John Deere 332 snowblower let me down. As a hockey coach, I rely on being able to clear the rink's parking lot quickly after a game. But my JD 332 struggled to handle the heavy snowfall, constantly clogging and lacking the power to get the job done. I was frustrated, to say the least. Despite being a diesel powerhouse, it seemed to be underperforming. I spent hours troubleshooting, but the issue persisted. It was a tough season, but I learned a valuable lesson about equipment maintenance and the importance of being prepared for the unexpected.
