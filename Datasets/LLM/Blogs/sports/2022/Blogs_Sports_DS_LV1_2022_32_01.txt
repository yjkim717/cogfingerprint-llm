### The Huddle Goes Digital: Finding Community in a Twitter Space

I’ll be honest, my relationship with college football in the fall of 2022 felt a little… fractured. Between the constant churn of conference realignment gossip and the transfer portal turning rosters into temporary housing, the sport I loved was starting to feel more like a business news feed. The pageantry was still there, but the soul felt distant.

Then, I stumbled into a Twitter Space.

The notification popped up on my phone: “Live: Sun Belt Commissioner & Journalists on the State of the Game.” On a whim, I put in my earbuds. What I found wasn’t a polished TV panel. It was a raw, unfiltered conversation. There was the commissioner, his voice clear but casual, talking about the unique challenges of sprint football programs. A beat reporter from a small-town paper chimed in with an observation that was so spot-on I actually said “yes!” out loud to my empty kitchen.

This wasn't a broadcast; it was a digital campfire.

A few nights later, I found myself in another Space, this one featuring a university president. Not a soundbite, not a press release, but a real person explaining the immense pressure and pride that comes with leading an institution where Saturday football fuels the entire community. You could hear the passion in his pauses. Someone in the audience asked a nuanced question about NCAA board governance, and he gave a nuanced, off-the-cuff answer. It was breathtaking.

For that whole week, I was hooked. I’d cook dinner with my phone propped up, listening to athletic directors, writers, and even a few former players. The magic wasn’t in the information—though that was great—it was in the *sound*. The slight hesitation before a tough question, the genuine laugh at a shared memory, the collective sigh when discussing a tough season. It was humanity, stripped of the helmets and the hype videos.

In an era where our sports discourse is so often reduced to angry tweets and hot takes, these Twitter Spaces felt like a return to something purer. They were the modern equivalent of hanging around after the game to hear the coaches debrief, or arguing with your uncles on the back porch about playoff scenarios. It was a reminder that beneath the billion-dollar TV deals and the recruiting star ratings, college football is, and always has been, about people and their stories.

The season ended, the Spaces went quiet, but the feeling stayed with me. The game’ landscape might keep shifting, but as long as there are places for real conversation, the heart of the sport will keep beating. You just have to know where to listen.
