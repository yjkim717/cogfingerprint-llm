**Chasing PBs and Finding My Pace**

2022 was a year of serious running goals – I was obsessed with personal bests! But honestly, the victories weren’t just about the stopwatch. There’s something incredible about joining a local running group; the shared struggle and cheers felt like a real community.

It’s a beautiful reminder that sometimes, the journey is just as rewarding as the destination.
