**The Illusion of Speed: Why Miles Don’t Tell the Whole Story in Basketball**

Okay, let’s be honest, I’ve spent a *lot* of time staring at NBA stats lately. It’s ridiculous, I know. We’re bombarded with player tracking data now – miles traveled, speed in miles per hour, even some fancy metric called “foot per stuff” that I still don’t entirely understand. And it's tempting to just look at the numbers and declare someone a superstar. 

But something felt…off. I was scrolling through the end-of-season reports for the 2021-22 season, particularly focused on guys racking up insane mileage, and it hit me: it’s not *always* about covering the most ground. 

I started thinking about guys like, well, let’s just say a certain point guard who was constantly zipping around the perimeter, seemingly chasing his own shadow. The tracking data would show him covered dozens of miles, a blazing 11.5 mph on average. But when you looked at his scoring, his assists, his defensive impact – it just didn’t quite add up. He was *running around*, certainly, but was he actually *playing*?

It’s a frustrating thing, isn’t it? We’re so quick to celebrate activity, to assume that more movement equals more value. But basketball, like any sport, is about impact. It’s about creating opportunities for your team, about making smart decisions, about defending intelligently. 

This year, I really started to appreciate players who were masters of efficiency - guys who could control the pace, make the right passes, and force the defense to react *to* them, rather than constantly forcing the action themselves. 

I think we need to be a little more critical of these distance metrics. They’re a tool, absolutely, but they shouldn’t be the sole measure of a player’s worth. Let’s remember that sometimes, the most valuable contribution is the one you *don't* see in the stat sheet.  What do you guys think? Am I overthinking this, or is there something to the idea that sometimes, less is more?
