## The Echo of a Missed Shot Still Rings

It's funny, isn't it, how some moments just stick with you? I’m still replaying that basketball game from last November. My team was down by one, seconds on the clock, and I had the open look. Wide open. I released the shot, felt the satisfying arc… and it clanged off the rim. Game over. 

2022 felt full of those little disappointments, those near-wins that slipped through the cracks. It wasn’t about the game itself, really. It was about the feeling – that fleeting hope, the crushing letdown. It’s a reminder that even when things *look* perfect, even when you’ve done everything right, sometimes you just miss. And that’s okay. It’s part of the process, part of the beautiful, frustrating, human experience of playing the game.
