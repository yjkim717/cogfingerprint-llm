I'm still reeling from the shocking upset at the 2022 NBA playoffs. As I sat on my outdated desktop, which was still rocking its 2013 specs - an ASRock A75M-HVS motherboard and an AMD A4-3400 processor, I couldn't help but think about upgrading its CPU to relive some of the magic on a smoother frame rate. But then I started wondering, is it worth it? Just like my old CPU, my favorite team was once a top contender, but now they're struggling to stay relevant. Sometimes, it's time to upgrade and move on.
