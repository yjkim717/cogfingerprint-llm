### The Agony of the Blue Checkmarks

So, there I was, staring at my phone like it held the secrets to the universe. Two blue checkmarks. “Read. 4:32 PM.”

Let me rewind. The date was… great. Honestly. We met for lunch, the conversation flowed effortlessly, and the hour we’d planned for stretched into two. We laughed about our mutual hatred for cilantro and bonded over a shared love of terrible 80s action movies. When we said goodbye, there was a genuine, “I had a really nice time,” from both of us. No awkward hug, just a warm smile. All the green lights.

Feeling confident, I waited a day and then sent what I thought was a perfect, low-pressure follow-up: “Hey, I had a great time on Wednesday. I’d love to take you to that arcade bar we talked about sometime. Let me know if you’re free next week.”

Simple. Clear. Referenced a shared interest. I put my phone down and didn’t look at it for a whole hour. But when I did, there they were. The twin blue ticks of modern dating purgatory. Delivered. Read. And then… silence.

My mind immediately went into overdrive. Was it something I said? Was the lunch bill-splitting awkward? Did she sense my nervousness when I talked about my cat’s elaborate napping schedule? The mixed signals are the worst part. The date felt so positive, so connective. How does that energy just vanish into the digital void?

It’s a bizarre feeling, being left on read after a good date. It’s not rejection; it’s a non-answer. A question mark hanging in the air. You’re left with nothing to work with but your own spiraling thoughts and the glaring, silent evidence of those two blue checkmarks. I guess the ball is very clearly not in my court anymore. On to the next swipe.
