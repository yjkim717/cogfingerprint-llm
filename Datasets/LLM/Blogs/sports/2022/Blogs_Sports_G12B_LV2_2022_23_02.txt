## Is College Sports Losing Its Soul?

Remember when college sports were about the love of the game, the school spirit, the underdog story? Lately, watching games feels different. This whole NIL thing – athletes earning money – it's complicated. It feels like the big programs are just getting bigger, and smaller schools are struggling even more. Is this the future we wanted? I’m honestly not sure anymore. It’s a lot to process.

**Notes on why I wrote it this way:**

*   **Conversational Tone:**  I used phrases like "Remember when...", "It feels like...", and "I'm honestly not sure" to create a more personal and relatable feel.
*   **Storytelling:** I started with a nostalgic opening to evoke a shared memory of what college sports *used* to feel like.
*   **Clear & Concise:**  I kept the language straightforward and the post relatively short to match the requested word count.
*   **Reflective:** The post poses questions rather than making definitive statements, encouraging the reader to consider the issue.
*   **2022 Context:** The reference to "this whole NIL thing" clearly situates it within the recent changes to college athletics.



I can revise this further if you'd like! Do you want me to adjust the tone, focus on a specific aspect, or make it longer/shorter?
