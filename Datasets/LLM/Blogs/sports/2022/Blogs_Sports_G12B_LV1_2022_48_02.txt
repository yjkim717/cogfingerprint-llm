>## The Blur of Victory (and My New Monitor!)

Man, what a few weeks in sports! The World Cup was absolutely insane – the tension, the upsets… I was glued to the screen. It really highlighted how much a crisp, clear image matters when you're experiencing that kind of high-stakes action. 

Speaking of screens, I finally upgraded my monitor! I went with a 240hz IPS panel, and I'm seriously impressed. I was debating between 1440p and 1080p, and let me tell you, the difference is noticeable. Everything just *pops* more with the higher resolution. Makes those game-winning goals even more breathtaking. Definitely worth the upgrade!
