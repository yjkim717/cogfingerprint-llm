## Remember When Your Athlete Crush Defined Your Life?

Okay, real talk. Anyone else have a sports hero growing up who felt… monumental? Like, *Mount Rushmore* monumental? I do. For me, it was Mia Hamm. Late 90s, early 2000s – she was *everything*. I plastered her picture on my locker, devoured any article I could find, and genuinely believed I was going to be a star midfielder just like her. 

Looking back, it’s hilarious how intensely I felt about it. Puberty was a weird time, naturally, and I think having this strong female role model – someone powerful, skilled, and undeniably cool – was a huge part of figuring things out. 

It’s funny how those crushes evolve, isn't it? Now, I appreciate her legacy and the impact she had on women's soccer, but the breathless obsession is long gone. Still, thinking about Mia Hamm brings back a flood of memories and a surprising wave of nostalgia for simpler times. Who was *your* sports icon? Let's hear it!
