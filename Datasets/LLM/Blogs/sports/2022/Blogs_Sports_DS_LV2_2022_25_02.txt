It’s funny how sports films stick with you. Watching one recently, I couldn’t shake the feeling that a certain cyclist was Matt Damon’s long-lost twin—Floyd Landis, anyone? And Skip Grigaris? Pure Paul Rudd energy. It’s 2022, and we’re all craving connection, even in these silly doppelganger moments. It makes the games and stories feel more personal, like spotting a friend in a crowd. Sometimes, the magic isn’t just in the victory, but in these strangely familiar faces.
