**The Unexpected Resilience of a Team**

Remember last fall? Our football team was… rough. We’d lost five straight games, morale was low, and honestly, it felt like we were just going through the motions. But something shifted after the mid-season slump. It wasn’t a dramatic change; more like a slow, steady consolidation. 

Like those liquid cultures, our team started to build a strong, dense mycelium of support – players helping each other, coaches adapting, and a renewed focus on the fundamentals. We still faced tough opponents, but we were less susceptible to contamination – the negativity and self-doubt that had been creeping in. 

We didn't suddenly become a powerhouse, but we found a surprising resilience, carefully stored and nurtured in the quiet of the practice field. It was a reminder that sometimes, the best growth happens in the shadows.
