>## The Unexpected Joy of Watching My Dad Watch Baseball

It’s funny, isn't it, how sometimes the most meaningful moments come when you’re not even *doing* the thing? This summer, I found myself less obsessed with the outcome of baseball games and more fascinated by my dad watching them. He's a lifelong Cardinals fan, and seeing the quiet intensity in his eyes, the way he’d groan at a strikeout and beam at a steal… it was a window into decades of memories.

He’d tell me little stories – about seeing Ozzie Smith play, about the '82 World Series. It wasn't just about the game anymore; it was about connection, about shared history. In a world saturated with instant gratification, it was a beautiful reminder to appreciate the simple joy of tradition and the people you share it with. 2022 felt a little brighter because of those evenings.
