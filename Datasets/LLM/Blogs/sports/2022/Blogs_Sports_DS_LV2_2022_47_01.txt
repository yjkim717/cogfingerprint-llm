It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my screen, heart pounding. Another Weekend League match, another opponent suffocating me with high pressure. I couldn’t breathe, let alone string two passes together. My usual possession game was in shambles.

Then, something clicked. I stopped trying to force my way through the middle. I went wider, stretching the play, and suddenly, gaps appeared. I started launching devastating counter-attacks, turning their aggression against them.

But the real game-changer? The camera. I’d been using the default Tele Broadcast for years. On a whim, I switched to Co-op, zoomed all the way out. The entire pitch opened up. I could see runs I never noticed before, anticipate pressure, and pick passes like a pro.

It wasn't a new formation or a magic tactic that saved my weekend. It was a simple shift in perspective. Sometimes, you just need to step back and see the whole field.
