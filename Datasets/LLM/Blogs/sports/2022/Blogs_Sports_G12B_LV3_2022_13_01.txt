>## The Unexpected Comfort of Watching From the Sidelines

Remember that feeling as a kid, desperately wanting to be *in* the game? I chased it relentlessly – soccer, basketball, even a brief, disastrous stint in baseball. But lately, watching my niece’s soccer games has given me a different kind of joy. It's quiet, observational. I'm not stressing about a missed goal or a bad pass. Just appreciating the teamwork, the effort, and the pure, unadulterated fun. Maybe sometimes, the best plays happen from the sidelines in 2022.
