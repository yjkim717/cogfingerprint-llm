**The Long Game: More Than Just Winning**

Honestly, this past season with the local rugby team felt…different. We were good, sure, consistently making playoffs, but there was this underlying sense that we weren’t *reaching* our potential. I kept thinking about my grandpa, a lifelong baseball fan, and how he always said it wasn’t about the final score, but the effort, the teamwork, the grit you showed *every* game. 

2022 was about that for us.  We didn't win the championship, but we played with a real fire, supporting each other through the tough losses.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most rewarding part of sports isn't the glory, but the journey of pushing yourself and your team to be better, one game at a time.  What about you – what’s *your* long game?
