As I watched the Cincinnati Bengals make a deep playoff run in 2022, I couldn't help but think of the 1999 Rams, who shared a fascinating similarity. Both teams had been given 150-1 preseason odds to win the Super Bowl, a record for the most unlikely champions. It's a reminder that in the NFL, anything can happen, and preseason odds are just a numbers game. History is full of such underdog stories, and it's what makes the sport so thrilling.
