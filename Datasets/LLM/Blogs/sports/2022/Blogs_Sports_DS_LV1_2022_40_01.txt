### The Magic of a Simple Break

It’s funny how a single shot can make you fall in love with golf all over again. Just last week, I was standing on the 7th tee, a tricky 165-yard par-3. The wind was up, and that green looked miles away. I pulled my trusty 5-iron, took a deep breath, and just tried to make solid contact.

The ball took off, a beautiful, high draw that landed softly on the front of the green. It was the kind of approach shot you replay in your head for days. But the real drama was just beginning. I had a slick 9-footer left for birdie, my heart thumping as I surveyed the putt. It had a subtle left-to-right break, maybe an inch or two.

In 2022, with everything feeling so chaotic in the world, there’s a profound peace in solving a simple puzzle like a putt’s break. I trusted my read, made a smooth stroke, and watched the ball dive into the center of the cup. My second-ever birdie. It wasn't about winning a tournament; it was a quiet, personal victory—a perfect reminder of why we keep coming back to this maddening, wonderful game.
