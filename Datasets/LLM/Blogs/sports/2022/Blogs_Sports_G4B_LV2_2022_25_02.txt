**That Weird Lance Armstrong Face**

Okay, so I was scrolling through some old cycling news last week, and it hit me – a bizarre little connection. I started noticing how much Paul Rudd looks like Skip Grigaris, the former USPS directeur sportif. It’s a subtle thing, but there’s a definite resemblance! 

Then it reminded me of Matt Damon and Floyd Landis – another uncanny echo. It’s funny how faces can evoke memories of athletes, and how sometimes, people just *look* like the legends of the sport.  Anyone else see these doppelgangers? #cycling #sports #doubles #paulrudd

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps add a different angle or focus on a specific aspect?
