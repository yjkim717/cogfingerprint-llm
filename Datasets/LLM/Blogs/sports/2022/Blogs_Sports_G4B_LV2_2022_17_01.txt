**The Unexpected Joy of Watching Alone**

2022 felt… different, didn’t it? So many games, so many friends, but honestly, sometimes I just needed to watch the Cubs without the usual chaos. There’s a strange quiet to it, a space to really *feel* the game. 

It reminded me of my grandpa – a huge fan who’d often watch alone, a worn baseball glove beside him. He used to say it wasn’t about the crowd, but the connection to the sport itself.  I get that now.  It’s a simple pleasure, appreciating the game, just me and the crack of the bat.
