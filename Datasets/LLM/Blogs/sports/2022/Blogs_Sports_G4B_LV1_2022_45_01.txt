**The Westbrook Rollercoaster: A Familiar Feeling**

Okay, let’s be honest, watching Russell Westbrook this year felt… oddly familiar. It’s like we’ve seen this movie before. The explosive energy, the relentless drives to the basket – it’s undeniably there. But then… the slow start. Remember the Wizards days? The frustrating cycles of promising beginnings followed by a complete stall? 

It’s a weird thing to observe a player you admire struggling to find his rhythm, especially when he’s still so incredibly talented. There’s that flicker of hope when he hits a big shot, followed by a little pang of concern. 

Seeing him find a groove with the Lakers was a relief, a reminder that he *can* be a key piece. But the echoes of those earlier struggles linger. It just goes to show, even in the NBA, consistency is a battle every single season. What do you think?
