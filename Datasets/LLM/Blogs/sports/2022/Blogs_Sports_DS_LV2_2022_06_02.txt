It’s 2022, and the NBA rumor mill is buzzing again—this time about Kevin Durant. I get it; he’s a generational talent. But as I sip my coffee and scroll through trade scenarios, I can’t help but pause.

We’ve seen this story before: a team mortgages its future, trading away young stars and draft picks for one big name. Yet, championships aren’t won on paper. KD is incredible, but he’s also 33, with a significant injury history. Remember how heavy the load felt in Brooklyn?

It makes me reflect on my own life—chasing that one "big break" without weighing the risks. Sometimes, what glitters isn’t gold. Building something sustainable, whether in sports or life, often means valuing the journey over a risky shortcut. Maybe the best moves are the ones we don’t make.
