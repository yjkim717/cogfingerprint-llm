**The Week 2 Chaos – And Why We Obsess Over Rankings**

Okay, let’s be honest, did you spend *any* of last Sunday glued to your screen, scrolling through every NFL power ranking you could find? I certainly did! ESPN, USA Today, even CBS – they were all throwing out their takes on where every team stood after Week 2 of the 2022 season. 

It’s a strange thing, isn’t it? We pour so much energy into these rankings. It feels almost…important. Like a definitive judgment on a team’s performance. But I’ve been thinking about it – aren't rankings just a snapshot in time? A collection of stats and opinions? 

Honestly, it's a fascinating reflection of our collective obsession with order and prediction.  I found myself comparing the ‘average success distance’ (avg sd - a surprisingly specific statistic!) across different outlets, trying to find the *one* true ranking.  Maybe it’s a harmless pastime, but it highlights how invested we are in seeing where teams *should* be, rather than just appreciating the messy, unpredictable beauty of the game itself.
