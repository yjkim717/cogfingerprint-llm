## Seeing the Growth: Pokus is Really Clicking

It’s been wild watching Pokus develop this year. Remember when his English was a bit of a barrier? Now, in late 2022, he's holding fluent conversations and really connecting with the team. But even more impressive is his game. He’s truly started to *ball out* on the court – making smart passes, hitting clutch shots. You can see the hours of work paying off. It's a testament to his intelligence and dedication; a real inspiration to watch a player grow both on and off the court.
