## The Unexpected Joy of a Taskmaster Tie

Okay, so I stumbled across a hilarious debate on Reddit the other day – a tie for best *Taskmaster* contestant! Fern Brady and John Kearns, both absolute legends from Series 14, were neck and neck in the fan vote. It was genuinely delightful to see. 

We’re so used to winners and losers, aren’t we? Especially in sports! But this tiebreaker vote highlighted something lovely: sometimes, celebrating the sheer brilliance of everyone involved is just as rewarding. Both brought such unique energy and humour to the show. 

It felt like a reminder that enjoyment isn’t always about crowning a champion. It's about appreciating the journey and the laughs along the way – a lesson I think we could all use a little more of in 2022.
