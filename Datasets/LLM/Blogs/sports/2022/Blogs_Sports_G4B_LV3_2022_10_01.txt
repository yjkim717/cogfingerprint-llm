**The Weight of a Trade Deadline**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching a team you’ve followed for years navigate a trade deadline. Right now, the Blazers’ situation with CJ McCollum feels… heavy. They’re clearly in a rebuilding phase, and the question swirling around everyone is: where does he go? 

As a fan, you naturally wonder if he’s headed to a contender, or if he’ll be part of another long rebuild. It's a reminder that even in the NBA, success isn't always immediate. It makes you think about the bigger picture – the patience needed, the sacrifices made – and how much you truly value a player’s commitment beyond just wins and losses. It's a complex feeling, this watching a team evolve.
