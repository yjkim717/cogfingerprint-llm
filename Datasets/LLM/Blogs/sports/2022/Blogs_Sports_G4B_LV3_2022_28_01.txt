**The Ghost of '96: Hunting for a True Rookie**

There’s something undeniably captivating about rookie cards, isn’t there? As a lifelong baseball fan, I’ve spent countless hours sifting through boxes, chasing that first glimpse of a player’s potential – captured in a glossy, imperfect image. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with a bigger question: what *really* makes a rookie card?

It’s not just the year, obviously. You can have a player debut in ‘96 and still be considered a prospect for years. Then there's the at-bats – a huge factor, but not the *only* one. I was just digging through some old boxes from the late 90s, specifically focusing on Scott – a player I’d always admired – and realized how complex it was to pinpoint his definitive first card. 

It made me think about the stories behind those cards, the journey a player takes before that first crack of the bat. It's more than just a piece of cardboard; it’s a tiny, frozen moment in time, a testament to years of hard work and the hope of a bright future.  Anyone else ever get lost in the details of their own collection?
