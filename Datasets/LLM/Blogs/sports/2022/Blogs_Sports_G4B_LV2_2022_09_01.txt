**The Unexpected Joy of a Single Shot**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something seemingly small can completely shift your perspective. This summer, 2022, I found myself unexpectedly captivated by a single-shot basketball game – a local league for folks who, like me, were maybe a *little* rusty after a couple of years off the court. 

I hadn’t played seriously in ages. My knees protested, my reflexes felt sluggish, and honestly, I just went in to enjoy some fresh air and a bit of friendly competition. I figured I’d mostly be watching, maybe offering a helpful (or not-so-helpful) comment from the sidelines. 

But then I started paying attention to *how* the games were played. It wasn’t about flashy crossovers or highlight-reel dunks. It was about smart positioning, patient passing, and that quiet, focused determination to simply make the *right* play. 

There was this one guy, Mark, who wasn't the biggest or fastest player. But he consistently found himself in the right spot, making the simple pass that led to the basket. He wasn’t trying to be a star; he was just… effective. 

It really struck me how much I’d been chasing bigger, more complicated goals in other areas of my life. Always striving for the ‘big play,’ the grand gesture, the instantly impressive result.  

Watching Mark, I realized there’s a deep satisfaction in focusing on the fundamentals, on doing your job well, on contributing to a team’s success in a small but meaningful way. It’s about the quiet joy of a single shot, perfectly executed, that ultimately leads to something greater. 

Maybe that's a lesson that applies to more than just basketball.  What little "single shots" are you focusing on lately?

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a different aspect of the writing style or aiming for a slightly different tone?
