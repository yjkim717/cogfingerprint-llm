As I stepped onto the court in 2022, the rush of competition took me back to my early days as a young athlete. Watching the younger players, I was reminded that it's not just about winning - it's about the love of the game. I thought about the countless hours of practice, the sweat, and the tears. The true spirit of sports lies in the camaraderie, the lessons learned, and the memories made. As I passed on my knowledge to the next gen, I rediscovered the joy that drove me to play in the first place.
