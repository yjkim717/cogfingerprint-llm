## The Unexpected Sting of a Comeback

Remember that feeling when your team's down, and everyone’s already writing their eulogy? That's how I felt watching the Phillies in the 2022 World Series. We were *so* close, and then…bam. A crushing loss. It stung, no doubt. 

But honestly, witnessing that fight, that sheer grit after being down 0-2? It was something special. It reminded me that even when the odds are stacked against you, believing in the possibility of a comeback is half the battle. It’s a lesson that extends far beyond the baseball diamond, doesn't it?
