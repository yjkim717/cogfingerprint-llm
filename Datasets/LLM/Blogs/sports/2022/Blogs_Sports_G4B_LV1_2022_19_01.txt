**Fueling the Grind: My New Morning Ritual**

Okay, so 2022 has been… a year. Seriously demanding, both at work and with training. I realized I was constantly running on fumes, and my recovery was practically non-existent. That’s when I started experimenting with my morning routine, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer.

It starts with a massive smoothie – spinach, banana, berries, you know the drill. But this year, I added a scoop of beet root powder. I was skeptical, but it’s seriously upped my energy levels. Then, a quick beet root drink to really kick things off.  

Following that, a solid workout – usually a HIIT session – and then I'm consciously focusing on stretching and foam rolling. It’s not about perfection, it's about setting myself up for a better day.  

I’m still learning, of course, but building this routine has helped me feel more prepared and, surprisingly, less stressed. What are your go-to morning rituals for a productive day?
