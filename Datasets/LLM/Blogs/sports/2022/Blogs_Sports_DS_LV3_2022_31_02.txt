It’s 2022, and I’m thinking about that moment in Taskmaster Series 14 when Fern Brady and John Kearns tied in the weekly polls. It felt like a sudden-death overtime in sports—that electric uncertainty before the tie-breaker vote. Who would the fans choose? It reminded me of those split-second plays that define championships, where passion and personality matter just as much as skill. Sometimes, the most memorable victories aren’t clear-cut; they’re decided by a heartbeat and a shared cheer.
