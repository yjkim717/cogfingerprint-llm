Remember that 2022 pickup game where my ankle gave out? I was sidelined for weeks, forced to just watch. At first, it was agony. But from the bench, I saw the whole courtâ€”the patterns, the silent communication. I wasn't just tracking the ball; I was seeing the game. That forced pause was an unexpected update to my entire perspective. Sometimes the biggest growth happens not in the race, but when life ships you a different role entirely. You just have to be willing to watch.
