**The Weight of a Belt**

There’s something strangely compelling about trophies, isn’t there? Not the flashy, enormous ones, but the smaller, unofficial ones – the kind that carry a weight far beyond their material value. This year, the “Belt” – that unofficial college football trophy – felt particularly heavy in the hands of the Oregon Ducks. 

I was watching the games, and it wasn’t just about the wins and losses. It was the *feeling* surrounding that belt. After a season of intense competition, it represented a series of battles, a consistent drive, and a team that truly earned its place.  The game against Baylor really stood out – a nail-biter that felt like it could have swung everything. 

It made me think about how we all collect little “belts” in our own lives – moments of achievement, small victories that, when strung together, build something significant. Maybe it’s mastering a new skill, finishing a challenging project, or simply showing up consistently when things get tough.  Holding onto those moments, acknowledging their importance, feels important.  What "belt" are you carrying right now?
