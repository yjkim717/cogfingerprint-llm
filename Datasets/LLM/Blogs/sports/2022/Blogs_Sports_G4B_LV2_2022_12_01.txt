**The Shot I Still See**

It’s funny how certain moments in sports just…stick. 2022 was a weird year, but watching my high school team lose in the semi-finals – that game replays in my head constantly. It wasn’t even a great shot *I* took; it was a teammate, a desperation heave at the buzzer. We lost by a single point. 

More than the loss, I remember the stunned silence, the collective disappointment. It taught me that sports aren’t just about winning, but about the shared experience, the grit, and the memories forged in the heat of the moment.  It’s a feeling I still carry with me.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps create a post with a different focus?
