Remember those early post-game interviews when Pokus struggled to find the words? Fast forward to 2022, and it’s a different story. Watching him at the press conference tonight, speaking fluent English while explaining his game strategy, was as impressive as his performance on the court. He didn't just "ball out"; he showcased a raw intelligence that proves his hard work extends far beyond the gym. It’s a powerful reminder that growth isn’t just physical—it’s a full-court press on every aspect of your craft.
