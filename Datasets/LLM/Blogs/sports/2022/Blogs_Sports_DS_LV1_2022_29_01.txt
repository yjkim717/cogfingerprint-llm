The postcard images of Napili Bay promised serene, turquoise waters and soft, white sand. What I hadn't fully anticipated in my October daydreams was the vibrant, pulsing reality of it. Arriving at the shore, I was met with a wonderful, cheerful chaos.

I’ll be honest, watching the 2022 World Cup final was an emotional rollercoaster I wasn’t prepared for. It wasn't just about the stunning goals or Messi’s legacy. It was that moment of pure, unscripted humanity when Mbappé, after a heartbreaking loss, stood for his national honor during France's medal ceremony. That quiet dignity in the face of defeat hit me harder than any victory parade. It was a powerful 2022 reminder that true character isn't forged in winning, but in how you carry the weight of a loss.
