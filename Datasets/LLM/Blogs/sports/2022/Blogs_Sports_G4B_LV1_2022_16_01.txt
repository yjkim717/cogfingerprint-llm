**The Weight of the Belt**

You know that feeling when something feels…important? Like, *really* important? This fall, that feeling has been centered around the College Football Belt. Seriously, it’s a ridiculous name, but the competition for it has been intense. 

Oregon’s been holding onto it pretty firmly – a series of wins, a well-timed bye week to recharge…it’s a good run. I’ve been watching the games, and it’s more than just about the scoreboard. There’s this unspoken pressure, this weight associated with carrying that belt. 

I was thinking about Baylor’s chances this week against UCLA, and how they’re hungry to take it back. It’s amazing how a silly, unofficial trophy can ignite such passion. It’s a reminder that college football, at its heart, is about tradition, rivalry, and a whole lot of pride.  What do you think – who deserves to keep the belt?
