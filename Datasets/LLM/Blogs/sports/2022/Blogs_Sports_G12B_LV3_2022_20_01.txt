## The Time I Almost Lost My Season (and Learned a Lesson)

Okay, I'm going to be honest – 2022 was a *rough* year for my softball season. I was so focused on clearing space on my laptop (like, seriously, the dreaded "trash" bin!), I accidentally deleted a ton of video clips I’d been saving for a highlight reel. Panic set in! It felt like losing a crucial game. Thankfully, some digital recovery magic happened, but it was a stark reminder: back everything up! Now, I religiously use cloud storage – a lesson learned the hard way on the field.
