The marching band rivalry is heating up again! As we dive into the 2022 college football season, I'm nostalgic for the epic battles between the Hawkeye Marching Band and their Cyclone counterparts. The drama that unfolds when these two groups take the field is pure entertainment. This year, I'm excited to see how the Hawkeye band's energetic performances will electrify the stands at Kinnick Stadium. Meanwhile, Cyclone fans are gearing up to travel to Iowa City, eager to cheer on their team and, let's be real, relive the el assico moments of past showdowns. As a fan of both the game and the pageantry surrounding it, I'm thrilled to see the marching band rivalry continue to thrive. With the right energy and some solid halftime shows, this season is shaping up to be a real treat for fans on both sides. The question is, who's ready for kickoff?
