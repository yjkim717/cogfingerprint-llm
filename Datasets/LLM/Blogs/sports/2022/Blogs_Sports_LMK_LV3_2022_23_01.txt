The thrill of college football season is here! As I plan my travel itinerary to catch the big games, I'm reminded of the electric atmosphere marching bands bring. But amidst the excitement, I'm also drawn to the intense rivalries that simmer beneath the surface. A few years ago, a heated encounter between the Hawkeye Marching Band and Cyclone fans sparked a reciprocal boycott that still resonates today. As I make my travel plans for 2022, I'm curious to see how these rivalries will play out on and off the field. Will the drama unfold, or will sportsmanship prevail?
