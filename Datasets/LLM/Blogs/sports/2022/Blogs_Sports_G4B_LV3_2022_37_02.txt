**The Strange Echo of a Smile**

I was scrolling through Reddit last fall, and this story completely grabbed me. It was about a guy who developed a *serious* grudge against both Kansas State and South Carolina… over tiny things. A missed handshake, a dismissive glance. It really got me thinking about how easily a small, seemingly insignificant interaction can stick with you, especially when it feels like a slight. 

It’s wild how sports rivalries can be built on such fragile foundations.  Maybe we all have our own "Dylan Thompson" moments – those little echoes of perceived disrespect that unexpectedly shape our opinions years later.
