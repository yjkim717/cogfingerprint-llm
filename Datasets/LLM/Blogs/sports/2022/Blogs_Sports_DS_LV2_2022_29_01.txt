The final buzzer echoed through the empty arena. 2022 was supposed to be my comeback season, the year I silenced the doubters after my injury. Instead, I’m back on the bench, watching. The roar of the crowd is just a memory now. It’s a humbling lesson. Sometimes the biggest fight isn't for the win, but for the patience to heal. You learn that your identity isn't just the game; it's the quiet resilience you build waiting for your next shot. And I will be ready.
