"As I watched the 2022 NHL season unfold, I found myself pondering the intricacies of faceoff stats. When Team A's center clashed with Team B's, the outcome wasn't always clear-cut. How do officials determine faceoff wins? Is it a clean draw, or a deflection off a stick? The NHL's methodology remains a mystery. I'd love to see more transparency on this - after all, faceoff wins can greatly impact game momentum."
