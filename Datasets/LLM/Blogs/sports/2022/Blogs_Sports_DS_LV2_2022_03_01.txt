There’s something about Monday Night Football that feels like a shared exhale after the weekend—a chance to gather, even virtually, and just be fans together. I’m thinking back to that Saints-Bucs game in 2022, the energy at Raymond James Stadium practically buzzing through the screen. It was more than just a game; it was a ritual. The friendly trash talk, the collective groans at a missed call, the sudden cheers that probably confused the neighbors. In those hours, we weren’t just watching athletes compete; we were connecting over a story unfolding in real time. Win or lose, it’s these nights that remind me why sports are a constant in our ever-changing lives.
