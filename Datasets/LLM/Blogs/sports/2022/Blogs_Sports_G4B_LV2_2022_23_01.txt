**A Little Bit of Cyclone Disappointment**

Okay, let’s be honest – I was pretty bummed this fall. As a lifelong Cyclone fan, I’m a sucker for the Iowa State Marching Band. They’re just… iconic. The energy they bring to games is unmatched. So, when I heard they were pulling out of the El Assico game to head to Kansas for a football matchup, a little piece of my heart sank. 

It’s more than just a game, right? It’s tradition. It's the feeling of being part of something bigger, something deeply rooted in Iowa State’s history.  I get it – logistics, travel, whatever the reason – but it felt like a shift. 

Still, as I watched the team battle it out in Kansas, I was reminded that fandom is about more than just the spectacle. It’s about the shared experience, the hope, and the unwavering support for the guys in maroon and white. Go Cyclones!
