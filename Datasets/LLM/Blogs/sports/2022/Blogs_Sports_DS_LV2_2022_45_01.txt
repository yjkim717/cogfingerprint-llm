### The Weight of the Jersey

You know, watching Russ in a Wizards jersey was one of the most fascinating, and frankly, heartbreaking things of the 2022 season. We all saw the stat lines—the man was still putting up numbers that would be career-years for most players. But you could feel the struggle through the screen.

That quad injury early on was a killer. It wasn't just about the missed games; it was about watching a player whose engine is his explosive power trying to rev with the handbrake on. He’d have a triple-double one night and look out of sync the next. In a season that was supposed to be about a playoff push, every inconsistent performance felt heavier.

It made me think beyond the box score. It’s a reminder that even the fiercest competitors are human. Sometimes, the circumstances—the injuries, the fit, the sheer weight of expectation—can make even a superstar's toughest battle the one against his own situation. It was hard not to root for him, even when it was hard to watch.
