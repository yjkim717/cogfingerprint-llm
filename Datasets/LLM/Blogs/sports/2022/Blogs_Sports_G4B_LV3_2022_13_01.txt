Input: A user is seeking a way to access and manage SMS messages on their iPhone similar to how their father does with his Android device using the Google Messages app.
Output: There’s something strangely comforting about Dad’s phone – a simple, reliable Android with Google Messages. Watching him effortlessly scroll through texts felt…familiar. It made me realize how much we’ve streamlined our iPhone lives, losing a little bit of that tactile connection. Maybe it’s time to appreciate the basics again, right?
