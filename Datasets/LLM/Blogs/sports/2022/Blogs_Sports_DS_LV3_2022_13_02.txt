The year was 2022, and my old gaming rig was starting to feel like a veteran athlete past their prime—struggling to keep up, but with so much heart left. I wasn't ready for a full system rebuild; my budget was tight, and honestly, I felt a strange loyalty to the old girl.

So, I went for the PC equivalent of a new training regimen: a CPU upgrade for the FM1 socket on my Asrock A75M-HVS motherboard. It was a gamble on compatibility, a small investment to squeeze out a few more seasons of reliable performance. It reminded me that sometimes, you don't need a brand-new team—you just need to upgrade your star player to stay competitive a little while longer.
