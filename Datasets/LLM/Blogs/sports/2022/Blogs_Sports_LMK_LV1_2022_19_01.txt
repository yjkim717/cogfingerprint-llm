As I stepped into the new year, 2022, I knew I had to shake things up - my morning routine was due for a refresh. I've always been a fan of starting the day with a solid workout, but I wanted to take it to the next level. Now, my mornings begin with a pre-workout smoothie packed with protein and nutrients. I hit the gym for a 60-80 minute session, pushing myself to new heights. The sweat drips, the weights clang, and I feel alive. Post-workout, I prioritize recovery - a cool-down stretch, a protein-rich snack, and a few minutes of meditation. It's not just about the physical gains; it's about setting a positive tone for the day. As I reflect on my journey so far, I'm proud of the consistency I've built. My morning routine has become a non-negotiable part of my daily ritual, and I feel more energized and focused than ever.
