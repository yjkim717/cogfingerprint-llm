"Bench Strength: Lessons from a Long Winter's Nap

As I laced up my running shoes in early 2022, I couldn't help but think about the long offseason that had just passed. Like a mycelium network lying dormant in liquid culture storage, my athletic endeavors had been in a state of suspended animation. But as I hit the pavement, I was curious to see how my 'viability' would hold up after months of inactivity. The first few runs were rough, but with each step, I felt my endurance and strength start to revive. Just as mycelium bursts forth from its storage medium, refreshed and ready to grow, I found my fitness level bouncing back. It's a reminder that sometimes, it's okay to slow down and store our energy for a while. When we're ready to 'grow' again, our foundation is still there, waiting to support us."
