**Remembering the Rush**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Looking back at 2022, and suddenly you’re hit with a wave of… well, *feelings*. Not just the current anxieties, but echoes of pure, unadulterated fandom. I was obsessing over [Insert Athlete Name - e.g., LeBron James] – a full-blown, “Mount Rushmore” level celebrity crush. 

Seriously, I devoured every interview, every highlight reel. It wasn’t just about the game, though. It was about the *idea* of him, the drive, the legacy. Like so many of us going through puberty, it felt like these figures represented something bigger – a potential, a dream. 

It’s wild to think how quickly those intense feelings can shift. Now, I appreciate him as a player, obviously, but the sheer, breathless admiration? That’s a different chapter.  Do you ever feel that way about sports heroes?
