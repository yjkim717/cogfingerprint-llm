>## When Even the Admins Miss: A Lesson in Online Community

Okay, so this might sound bizarre, but it happened. Remember how much we all relied on Reddit during the 2022 college football season? Well, a little mishap unfolded on one of those subreddits recently. Apparently, an administrator – yes, *the* admin – accidentally posted and stickied a spam link right at the top! 

It bumped a regularly scheduled, helpful sticky post, and chaos ensued. It’s a funny reminder that even the people managing online spaces can make mistakes. It sparked a good conversation though, with folks suggesting a review of moderation policies. It just goes to show, building and maintaining a community, whether it's cheering on our favorite team or sharing tips online, takes constant vigilance and a little bit of grace for when things go sideways.
