Of all the things I expected to feel in the middle of March Madness, a profound sense of kinship with a small Jesuit university from Jersey City was not one of them. Yet, here we are. While the world was busy filling out brackets with the usual suspects—Kansas, Gonzaga, Kentucky—a team called the Saint Peter’s Peacocks decided to strut right into the middle of the party and rewrite the rules. A 15-seed. Let that sink in for a moment.

In the sterile, number-crunching world of sports analytics, their story is an impossibility. I read a statistic recently that hit me like a thunderclap. Because of their miraculous run to the Elite Eight in 2022, Saint Peter’s alone now has better odds of winning a national championship *this century* than every other 15-seed combined for the rest of the 2000s. Let me say that again. One team, in one magical three-week stretch, did something so statistically absurd that it outweighs the collective future probability of every underdog in its same position for the next 78 years.

It’s a number that should feel cold, but it’s the warmest data point I’ve ever encountered. Because it’s not really about probability; it’s about a moment in time that defies it. It’s about the human spirit giving a cheeky wink to the supercomputers.

I think we’re all drawn to stories like Saint Peter’s because, on some level, we’re all 15-seeds in our own lives. We walk into boardrooms, family gatherings, or just the daily grind feeling like the long shot. We see the giants in our path—the Kentuckys and Purdues of our personal and professional worlds—and the odds are so often stacked against us. The spreadsheet of life says we shouldn’t succeed. The probability calculation says we should be packing our bags by the weekend.

But then you watch a team like the Peacocks. You watch them play with a swagger that isn’t arrogance, but a pure, unadulterated belief. There’s no fear in their eyes, only fire. They aren’t just happy to be there; they fully believe they belong. And with each upset—first Kentucky, then Murray State, then Purdue—that belief becomes a tangible force. It’s contagious. It leaps through the screen and dares you to believe, too.

That’s the real magic they left us with. It’s not just a Cinderella story that ends at midnight. It’s a permanent crack in the foundation of what we think is possible. Every time a 15-seed steps onto the court from now until 2100, they’ll carry a little piece of that Saint Peter’s magic with them. The analysts will still say it can’t be done, but the players will know, deep down, that it already has been.

Their run was a beautiful, chaotic, glorious reminder that the heart isn’t a variable you can plug into an algorithm. Hustle, chemistry, and a collective refusal to quit are currencies that the oddsmakers can’t quantify.

So, as I look back on the 2022 tournament, I’m not just remembering a fun underdog story. I’m holding onto a lesson. Saint Peter’
