It’s 2022, and I can’t stop thinking about Ben Simmons. We’ve all had that moment where the pressure feels immense, and we shrink a little. Watching him in the playoffs was like that. It wasn't about the jump shots he wouldn't take; it was the free throws he had to. Each miss seemed to carry the weight of a thousand criticisms. And the aggression—or lack thereof—it felt familiar, like that fear of failing so publicly that you just hold back. It’s a human struggle, playing out on the biggest stage. We weren’t just watching a basketball player; we were seeing a reflection of our own doubts.
