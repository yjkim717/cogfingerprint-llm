## The Unexpected Beauty of a Second Serve

It’s funny, isn’t it, how life throws you curveballs? Last summer, I was *convinced* I was going to crush the local tennis league. I'd spent months practicing my forehand, visualizing victory, the whole nine yards. Then, the first match happened. And… I choked. Badly.

My serve? Forget powerful, it was more of a gentle lob. I felt my confidence plummet with every missed shot. It was humiliating. I almost quit. 

But something held me back. Maybe it was stubbornness, maybe a tiny flicker of hope. I started focusing not on the perfect serve I *thought* I should have, but on just getting the ball in play. Adjusting my stance, slowing down, really *feeling* the swing.

It wasn't glamorous. It wasn't the highlight reel material. But slowly, steadily, my second serve improved. It wasn’t perfect, not by a long shot, but it was reliable. And that reliability, that ability to adapt and course-correct, proved more valuable than any initial flash of brilliance. 

2022 taught me a lot about that, didn’t it? Sometimes, the best victories aren’t the ones we plan for, but the ones we build, one adjusted serve at a time. What unexpected lessons did you learn this year?
