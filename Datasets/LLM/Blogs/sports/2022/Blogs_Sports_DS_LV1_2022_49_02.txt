Looking back on 2022, it’s wild how wrestling nostalgia hit a new peak. I found myself diving into classic OSW Reviews, reliving the glory of Hulkamania and WrestleMania X7. Debating the best storyarcs with friends reminded me why I love sports—it’s those shared memories and epic rivalries that stick with you. Even the Warrior’s bizarre WCW run has its charm. It’s more than just entertainment; it’s a thread connecting generations of fans.
