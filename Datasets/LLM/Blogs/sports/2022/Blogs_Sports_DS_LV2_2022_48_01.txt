That swish of the net in my first rec league game of 2022 brought back a flood of memories. It wasn't about the score, but the feeling—the same pure joy I had as a kid shooting hoops alone until the streetlights flickered on. It’s funny how a simple game can be a time machine, reminding you that the heart of sport never changes, even when your jump shot isn't what it used to be. It’s a connection to a younger, simpler you.
