"Frustrating Encounters on Chess.com"

I've been playing 5-minute games on chess.com since 2022, and it's been a wild ride. At lower levels, I've encountered some unsportsmanlike opponents who love to troll you after a loss. It's disheartening to see players resort to personal attacks rather than graciously conceding defeat. As a chess enthusiast, I wish we could keep the game respectful and enjoyable for everyone, win or lose.
