**The Unexpected Cost of the Game**

Remember 2022? I was obsessed with my local hockey team, watching every game like it was the Super Bowl. But then I started looking into the team’s sponsorship deals – and it felt a little…off. Paying a huge sum just for a logo on the jersey, even if you didn’t really *notice* it? It was like paying a hefty broker fee just for the *chance* to be part of the team. 

It made me think about buying a house – that initial contract felt similar.  A percentage of the sale, regardless of how much support you actually needed.  Sometimes, the biggest costs aren’t always the most obvious ones.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps create a different blog post based on a different summary?
