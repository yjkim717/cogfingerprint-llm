**The Hunt for That *One* Jersey**

Anyone else have that feeling? You’re scrolling through eBay, or a vintage shop, and suddenly *there it is*. A jersey, a hat, a piece of gear that just screams “memories.” I was hunting for a specific Celtics throwback from 2008 – a faded green number with Paul Pierce’s number on the back. It’s a long shot, but the thrill of the search, the imagining of wearing it again… it’s a surprisingly powerful feeling, isn’t it?
