I'm still fuming about last night's game. My son's Minecraft Star Wars pack on Xbox Series X was a bust. He bought it with his Minecoins, but it just wouldn't download. We tried every trick in the book - restarting the console, checking the internet connection, you name it. But nope, it just wouldn't budge. It was like watching a crucial soccer match in 2022's World Cup and having the stream cut out on you. Frustrating doesn't even begin to cover it. Has anyone else had this issue? Any solutions would be a lifesaver!
