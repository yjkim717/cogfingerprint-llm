The crack of the bat. The smell of fresh-cut grass. Stepping back onto the baseball diamond for the first time since high school in 2022, it all came rushing back. My old glove, stiff and weathered, felt foreign on my hand. The first few pitches I swung at were embarrassingly late; the muscle memory was buried under years of desk jobs and dad duties.

But then, connecting with a fastball—that pure, sweet vibration shooting up my arms—was a time machine. It wasn't about being the star player anymore. It was a conversation with my younger self, a reminder that some joys, like the simple thwack of a hit, never get old. The score didn't matter; feeling alive again did.
