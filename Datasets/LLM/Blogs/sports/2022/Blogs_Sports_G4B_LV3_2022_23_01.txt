**The Unexpected Road Trip**

2022 felt like a year of navigating unexpected turns, didn’t it? I was following the ISU Marching Band’s journey, and honestly, it struck a chord. The news that they were heading to Lawrence, Kansas, instead of Iowa City for El Assico – it wasn’t just about the football game; it was about a history of shifting landscapes and travel hurdles. 

There’s something inherently fascinating about sports and the stories behind the wins and the detours. It reminded me that sometimes, the most meaningful moments aren't always the planned ones.  The band’s decision, born from past challenges, felt like a testament to resilience and a willingness to adapt. It made me think about how we all deal with unexpected changes, and how those shifts can ultimately shape our paths.
