**The Misconception of "Running Around, Doing Nothing" in the NBA: A Closer Look at Player Performance**

As a huge NBA fan, I've always been fascinated by the common criticism that some players "run around, doing nothing" on the court. You know, the ones who seem to be hustling all game, but don't necessarily put up impressive box score numbers. For a while, I bought into this narrative, assuming that players like Russell Westbrook were the epitome of this phenomenon. That is, until I stumbled upon some fascinating data analysis that challenged my perspective.

The initial spark for this exploration came when I saw some tweets discussing the distances traveled by NBA players during games. The idea was simple: by tracking how far players ran, we could gain insight into their overall effort and contribution to their team's success. I was intrigued by the prospect of quantifying the intangible aspects of player performance.

Upon diving deeper into the data, I was surprised to discover that some of my preconceived notions about certain players were turned on their head. Take Patrick Beverley, for example. The veteran guard has often been stereotyped as a "3-and-D" player, known for his tenacious on-ball defense and rugged playstyle. However, critics often imply that he's more of a pest than a meaningful contributor on offense.

The data, however, tells a different story. Beverley consistently ranks among the top players in terms of distance traveled per game. In fact, during the 2021-2022 season, he averaged an impressive 3.13 miles per contest, which placed him squarely among the league's elite in terms of endurance. To put this into perspective, the average NBA player covers around 2.5 miles per game, so Beverley was exceeding that by a significant margin.

Now, you might be thinking, "Okay, that's interesting, but what does it really mean?" After all, just because a player is running a lot doesn't necessarily mean they're having a positive impact on the game. To answer this, let's take a closer look at Beverley's overall performance.

During the 2021-2022 season, Beverley averaged 9.5 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game, while also providing a defensive presence that was crucial to the Los Angeles Clippers' success. He achieved this while playing an average of 30.7 minutes per game, which is a significant workload.

One of the most striking aspects of Beverley's game is his ability to impact the court in various ways. He's not just a one-dimensional defender; he's also a capable playmaker who can create for himself and his teammates. In fact, his assist percentage (14.3%) was significantly higher than the league average, indicating that he's more than just a "3-and-D" specialist.

In contrast, players like Russell Westbrook, who are often criticized for "running around, doing nothing," actually put up some impressive numbers. Westbrook, in particular, has faced criticism for his playing style, with some arguing that he's more of a liability than an asset on the court. However, the data suggests that he's still an elite athlete who is willing to put in the effort.

During the 2021-2022 season, Westbrook averaged 2.93 miles per game, which was still above the league average. While this isn't as high as Beverley's total, it's still an impressive figure considering Westbrook's age and
