It’s wild to watch a team like Michigan find its rhythm, isn’t it? This season, seeing them consistently dominate in the redzone – scoring on every attempt – felt like a turning point.

That level of efficiency speaks to a deeper understanding of the game, a trust in the players, and a focused approach.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most satisfying wins are the ones built on quiet, strategic improvements.
