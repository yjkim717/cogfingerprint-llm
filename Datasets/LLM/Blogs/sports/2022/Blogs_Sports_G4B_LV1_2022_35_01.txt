**Chasing Light and Laughs: My Photo Friday Adventures**

2022 was a year of rediscovering my love for running, and it was largely thanks to a little online community. I stumbled upon a running subreddit dedicated to “Photo Friday” – a weekly challenge to share your best running pics. It was brilliant! 

I started posting, mostly just to keep myself motivated, and ended up running with a fantastic ‘running buddy’ we met through the subreddit. We’d swap stories and encouragement before our parkrun runs. 

Seeing those vibrant photos, the snowy trails, the muddy puddles – it really captured the joy of the sport. It’s amazing how a simple weekly photo prompt can build a supportive network and remind you why you started running in the first place.  Definitely going to keep chasing that light and those laughs!
