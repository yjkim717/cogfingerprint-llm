**Chasing Light and Community: A Photo Friday Reflection**

It’s funny how a simple online thread can pull you in, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been dipping my toes into the world of Photo Friday on Reddit, specifically within the running community. I stumbled across a really lovely thread showcasing runners sharing their best shots – crisp autumn parkruns, muddy trail runs, even just a determined face against a grey sky. 

Seeing those photos really sparked something. 2022 felt like a year of rediscovering my own love for running, and these images perfectly captured that feeling of being out there, pushing myself, and connecting with nature. It’s not about speed or distance, but about the light, the scenery, and the shared experience. 

It reminded me of parkrun – a brilliant way to build a local running community and get involved.  There's something incredibly motivating about seeing others tackling their runs, and those shared photos are just a beautiful reminder of that. Have you been sharing your running adventures lately?
