The wait is over! The new main voters for the 2022-23 /r/CFB Poll have been announced, and it's exciting to see who's in the mix. As a college football fan, I'm always eager to dive into the new season and start debating with fellow enthusiasts. The introduction of new main voters brings a fresh perspective to the table, and I'm curious to see how their opinions will shape the rankings. Meanwhile, provisional voters are being welcomed to participate, giving them a chance to prove themselves and potentially earn a spot among the main voters. It's a great opportunity for new voices to be heard. As we kick off the 2022-23 season, the energy is palpable. I'm looking forward to seeing how the polls unfold and which teams will rise to the top. Let's get ready for another thrilling season of college football!
