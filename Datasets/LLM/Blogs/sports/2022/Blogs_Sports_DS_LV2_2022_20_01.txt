That final buzzer in 2022 still echoes. We didn't win the championship, but in the locker room, something shifted. It wasn't about the trophy we didn't lift, but the quiet nods between us, the raw, honest conversations. We realized our strength wasn't in a perfect season, but in how we faced an imperfect one together. That loss, strangely, was the victory. It forged a bond no win ever could, teaching me that the most profound triumphs are often disguised as defeats.
