**Remembering the Jazz’s Magic in ‘22**

There’s something uniquely captivating about watching a team really *move* the ball. This year, I found myself utterly mesmerized by the Utah Jazz – specifically, their early-season assist numbers. It felt like a throwback, a nod to the Sloan era, and a reminder that sometimes, the simplest approach – passing and trusting your teammates – is the most effective. Rory Gallagher would’ve loved it!  It was a beautiful, flowing style of basketball.
