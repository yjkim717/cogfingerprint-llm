That 2022 season was a grind. Every practice felt like a mountain, and my motivation was at rock bottom. Then, my old coach showed up unannounced. He didn't give a pep talk; he just tossed me a ball and said, "Remember why you started." We started playing a simple game of catch. In that rhythmic, quiet exchange, the joy came flooding back. It wasn't about winning or stats. It was about the pure, simple love of the game I'd lost. Sometimes, you just need to go back to the beginning.
