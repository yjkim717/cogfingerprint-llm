As I watched the 2022 surfing competition at Napili Bay, I couldn't help but think about the true meaning of aloha. Some spectators were being loud and obnoxious, using language that made local families uncomfortable. It was a stark contrast to the spirit of the sport. I left feeling disappointed, wondering if these visitors understood that respecting the local culture is just as important as catching a wave.
