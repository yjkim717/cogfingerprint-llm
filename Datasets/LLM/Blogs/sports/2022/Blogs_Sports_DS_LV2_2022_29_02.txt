That final buzzer in 2022 still echoes. We didn't get the trophy, but we got something better. In the locker room, exhausted and defeated, I saw it—the raw respect in my teammates' eyes. We’d left everything on the court for each other. That shared struggle, that unbreakable bond forged in pursuit of a common goal… that’s the real victory. It’s a feeling no scoreboard can ever capture, and it’s what I’ll carry with me long after the cheers fade.
