"Happy #PhotoFriday, runners! As we dive into the final stretch of 2022, I'm excited to announce this week's winners of our running photo feature. Congratulations to Sarah and Mike, whose stunning parkrun snaps stole the show! But the fun doesn't stop here - we want to see YOUR running route selfies and race photos! Whether you're a seasoned marathon runner or just starting out, we love celebrating your journey. Share your photos with us on social media using #RunningCommunity, and you could be featured next Friday. As I look back on my own running journey this year, I'm reminded that it's not just about the miles - it's about the memories we make along the way. So grab your camera, hit the pavement, and let's get snapping! Who knows, you might just inspire someone to lace up and get moving."
