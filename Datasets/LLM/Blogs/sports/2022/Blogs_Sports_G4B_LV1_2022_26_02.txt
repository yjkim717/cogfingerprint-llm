**The Unexpected Return to the Field**

It feels a little silly admitting this, but I’d completely lost my spark with baseball. I was just going through the motions, watching games without really *seeing* them. Then, I dusted off my Arena account – Magic: The Gathering, you know? – and suddenly, it was like rediscovering the whole point. 

It got me thinking about the pressure to “optimize” everything, to chase the highest scores or the best stats.  I started wondering if obsessing over those metrics was actually taking the joy out of it.  Maybe it’s time to shift my focus back to just enjoying the game, like I used to.  Anyone else feel that way lately?
