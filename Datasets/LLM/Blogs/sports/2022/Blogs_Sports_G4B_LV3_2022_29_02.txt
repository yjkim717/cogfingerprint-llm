**The Echoes at the Field**

There’s something about a high-energy sporting event that pulls you in, right? Last fall at the college football game, I was caught up in the roar of the crowd, the thrill of the play. But then, a small group near me started escalating – shouting, trash talk getting really loud, and honestly, a bit disrespectful toward the referees. It felt jarring. 

It made me think about the spirit of competition, and how easily it can be overshadowed by ego. A reminder that wins and losses are great, but sports should ultimately be about respect – for the game, for the officials, and for everyone around you.
