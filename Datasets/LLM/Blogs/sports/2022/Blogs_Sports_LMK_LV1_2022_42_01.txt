As I watched the Timberwolves game up close, one thing became crystal clear: Jaylen Nowell deserves more court time. When he logs 20+ minutes, the team is nearly unbeatable, boasting an impressive 8-4 record. It's hard not to wonder if coaching decisions are holding him back. Nowell's three-point shooting is a game-changer, and I believe giving him more playing time could be the key to unlocking a winning streak. Is it time for the Timberwolves to take a leap of faith and give Nowell the minutes he deserves?
