## The Unexpected Weight Loss Side Effect of Being Under the Weather

Okay, so I'm officially admitting defeat to this cold. It's been lingering for days, and honestly, the worst part isn't the sniffles – it's the complete lack of appetite. Suddenly, my usual pre-workout smoothie feels…unappealing. And that post-run recovery shake? Forget about it.

It got me thinking: is this weird calorie deficit actually *helping* my fitness goals? I know, it sounds counterintuitive! I've been consistently training for that half marathon all year, and now my body's naturally operating at a deficit. Will it be a quick fix, or will my metabolism eventually rebel and cling to every carb in sight once I feel better? It's a strange twist in the fitness journey, isn't it? Hoping for a speedy recovery and a return to normal eating habits – and hopefully, some progress towards that finish line!
