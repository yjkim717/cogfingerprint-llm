## The Upset and the Unexpected Respect

Remember that shocker at the World Cup in 2022? Morocco making it to the semi-finals? It wasn't just about the football, though. Watching the celebrations, seeing the genuine joy radiating from the fans – it was a powerful reminder of what sports *should* be. Lately, it feels like a lot of competitive events have become… performative. Focused on branding, on revenue, and sometimes, it seems, forgetting the heart of the game. Morocco’s run felt real, a burst of pure, unadulterated passion. It gave me a renewed appreciation for the spirit of competition, and a little nudge to remember why I got into watching sports in the first place.
