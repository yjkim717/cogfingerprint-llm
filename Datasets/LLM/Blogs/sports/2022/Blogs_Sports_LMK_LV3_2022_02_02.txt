"Stepping Up to the Plate: A Backyard Baseball Pavilion Story"

As I embarked on my backyard remodel in the spring of 2022, I couldn't help but think about the countless summer days I spent playing catch with my kids. The project was more than just a construction endeavor; it was about creating a space where memories would be made. I was determined to include a pavilion that would be the crown jewel of our outdoor oasis. The decision to use red cedar for the structure was a no-brainer - its natural beauty and durability made it the perfect choice. Sure, the lumber cost was a factor, but the end result was worth it. Now, as we enjoy family baseball games under the pavilion's shade, I'm reminded that sometimes the splurge is worth it. The joy on my kids' faces as they swing for the fences makes every dollar spent on that red cedar pavilion feel like a home run.
