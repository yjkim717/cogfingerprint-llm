### **Elevating My Game: Chasing the Perfect Airborne Shot**

I’ve always believed the best way to win a firefight in the Crucible is from an angle they never expect.

In the locker room, expecting silence, my teammate Jake clapped me on the shoulder. "Tough shot, man. You had the guts to take it." That’s when it hit me. The real win wasn't on the scoreboard. It was in that moment of support, the shared understanding that we dared to try together. That loss taught me more about teamwork than any victory ever could.
