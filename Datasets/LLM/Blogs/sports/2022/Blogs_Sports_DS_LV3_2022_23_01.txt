There’s something electric about college football Saturdays—the roar of the crowd, the crisp autumn air, and yes, the marching bands. In 2022, as I mapped out my CFB travel plans, I knew it wasn’t just about the game; it was about the spectacle. I’ll never forget the drama of El Assico, that quirky Iowa vs. Iowa State rivalry where the bands almost steal the show. One year, the Hawkeye band’s unexpected medley had fans buzzing more than the final score. It’s in those moments you realize: the bands aren’t just background noise. They’re the heartbeat of the stadium, turning tension into tradition and travel into treasure. Because in the end, it’s these shared, spirited experiences that make every mile worth it.
