>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational, and relatable tone, set in 2022. I've focused on the emotional aspect of seeing a team transition and a beloved player potentially move on.  I've included a couple of options, one a bit longer and one a little shorter, to give you some flexibility.

**Option 1 (Longer):**

## Saying Goodbye (Maybe) to CJ: A Blazers Fan’s Heart

It’s a strange feeling, isn’t it? Watching a team you’ve rooted for, through thick and thin, begin a major shift. The Blazers are clearly entering a rebuilding phase, and that means tough decisions. Lately, all the chatter has been circling CJ McCollum, and honestly, it's been hitting me harder than I expected.

CJ isn't just a player; he’s been the heart and soul of this team for years. We’ve shared so many moments – the playoff runs, the clutch shots, the sheer joy of watching him weave his magic on the court. The possibility of him moving on, potentially to a contender like Philadelphia, feels… bittersweet.

It’s the reality of the NBA, of course. Teams evolve, players move on. But it still stings a little. I find myself reflecting on all the memories, hoping that whatever happens, CJ knows how much we appreciate him. Rebuilding is never easy, especially when it means saying goodbye to familiar faces. Here's hoping the future holds something exciting for the Blazers, and for CJ, wherever he may be.

**Option 2 (Shorter):**

## The Blazers' Rebuild and a CJ Question

The word "rebuild" is tough to swallow as a Blazers fan. It's especially true when the conversation turns to CJ McCollum. Seeing a player who’s been such a consistent presence, such a vital part of our team’s identity, potentially being traded… it’s a weird feeling.

I’ve been thinking a lot about the memories – the late-game heroics, the camaraderie with Dame.  It’s hard to imagine Rip City without CJ. While I understand the business side of things, and the need to move forward, it’s a reminder that nothing lasts forever in the NBA. Here's to hoping for a bright future for the Blazers, and wishing CJ all the best.
