It’s 2022, and I’m still amazed by how combat sports bring us together. I remember watching an up-and-coming MMA YouTube channel—just 60,000 strong—and feeling that raw, shared excitement in every comment. They were hunting for a voice to match their passion, offering $100 for three weekly videos. It got me thinking: behind every knockout highlight, there’s a storyteller helping us feel the grit and glory. That’s the heartbeat of sports—the voices that make us lean in closer.
