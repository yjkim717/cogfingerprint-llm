But on our Xbox Series X, it just wouldn't download. We’ve restarted the console, checked the connection, and even reinstalled the game. The purchase is confirmed, but the pack is stuck in limbo.

For four years, this lane had been my home of early mornings and burning lungs. But in that moment, the pressure vanished. This wasn't about the clock or the podium anymore. It was a thank you—to my teammates, to the discipline, to the quiet strength I found when I was too tired to go on. I dove in, not for a time, but for the memory.
