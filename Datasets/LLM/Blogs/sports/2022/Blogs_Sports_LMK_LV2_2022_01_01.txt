"Stepping onto the field in 2022, I was reminded that sports isn't just about winning or losing - it's about the journey. As I watched my kid's soccer game, I saw the thrill of competition, the agony of defeat, and the joy of teamwork. It struck me that these moments are what make sports so special. Just like uploading Xbox gameplay to YouTube or Twitch streaming, sharing these experiences can bring people together. What if we focused on the moments that make sports meaningful, rather than just the score?"
