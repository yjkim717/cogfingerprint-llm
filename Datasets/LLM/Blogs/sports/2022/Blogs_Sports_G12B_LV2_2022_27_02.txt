## The Echo of a Great Rookie Year

Something about Jeremy Peña's 2022 season with the Astros really struck a chord. Watching him shine at shortstop brought back memories of Troy Tulowitzki's electrifying rookie year – the defensive wizardry, the clutch hits… it felt connected. It’s funny how sports can trigger those nostalgic feelings, reminding us of the excitement of discovering a new star. Hoping Peña can build on this foundation and continue to impress!
