**Remember When No One Believed?**

It’s weird to think about 2022 – a year where the Bengals were saddled with a Super Bowl odds of 150-1. Seriously, 150-1! It brought to mind a crazy stat: they were the first team since the Rams back in ‘99 to be given such long odds. It’s a humbling reminder that sometimes, the most improbable journeys start with absolutely no one expecting you to win.  Crazy, right? #CincinnatiBengals #NFL #SuperBowl #PreseasonOdds
