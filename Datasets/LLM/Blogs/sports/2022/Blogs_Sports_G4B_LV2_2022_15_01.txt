**The Phantom Pass – And Why I Still Check My Text**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single missed opportunity can stick with you like a stray rebound. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with this feeling – a quiet anxiety about… well, not quite *failure*, but a sense of potential disappointment. It all started with a game last fall. 

I was playing indoor soccer, a chaotic, sweaty mess of sprints and dives. I made a brilliant play, a perfectly weighted pass that landed right at my teammate’s feet – a guaranteed goal. But in the heat of the moment, I completely missed the chance to celebrate with him. I just kept playing, focused on the next shift. 

Later, we were grabbing a quick post-game coffee, and I realized I hadn't even said, “Good job!” – a simple acknowledgement, a little bit of connection. It felt…wrong. 

It’s weird, but it echoed something I was dealing with recently – a first date that fizzled out, a delayed follow-up, and the nagging worry of being ‘left on read.’  It’s the same feeling, really. That little phantom pass you *knew* you should have connected on.

I’ve been trying to be better about those small, immediate moments of recognition. A quick text, a genuine “That was awesome,” – it’s not about grand gestures, it’s about showing you were *there*.  Because sometimes, just like that missed pass, a little bit of connection can make all the difference.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, change the story, add a specific detail)?
