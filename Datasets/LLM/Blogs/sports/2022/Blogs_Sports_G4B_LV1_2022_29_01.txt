**Sun, Sand, and a Whole Lot of People**

October 2022 – I finally made it to Napili Bay in Maui, and honestly, it was… a lot. Pictures don’t really do it justice. The beach was beautiful, of course, but packed with families and tourists. It was a reminder that even the most idyllic places can get crowded. I love the feeling of a quiet beach, but witnessing that energy – so many people enjoying the sun – made me appreciate the peaceful moments even more. It’s good to be reminded of the simple joy of being by the water!
