## The Price of the View: Why I Still Root for the Underdogs

Remember that feeling in October 2022? The air was crisp, football season was in full swing, and everyone was talking about the undefeated juggernauts. The teams with the star power, the deep pockets, the seemingly endless stream of talent. It's easy to get swept up in that, right? The shiny, the perfect, the *expensive*.

It reminded me a little of a project I was working on at the time: building a small pavilion in our backyard. I wanted that classic, rustic look – specifically, red cedar. Beautiful, durable, *expensive* red cedar. My wife kept suggesting pine, a perfectly good alternative, but it just didn’t have the same feel. It lacked that… character.

Watching the Eagles struggle against the Cowboys, despite all their supposed advantages, it hit me. Sometimes, you root for the team that’s fighting for every inch, the one that’s built with grit and ingenuity, not just endless resources. Like choosing those rafters, carefully fitted, over a prefabricated, mass-produced solution.

Sure, the cedar pavilion cost more upfront. But that view, that feeling of something built with care and intention? That's priceless. And sometimes, seeing a team – or a person – overcome odds with heart and hustle is worth far more than any perfect record. Rooting for the underdog isn’t about expecting victory; it’s about appreciating the effort.
