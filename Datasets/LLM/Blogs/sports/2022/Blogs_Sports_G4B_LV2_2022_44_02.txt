**A Nervous Anticipation for Diriyah**

There’s something about the start of a new tournament that gets me buzzing. This year, it’s the Diriyah Cup, and I’m already picturing the tension on the court. I’m particularly curious to see how Alexander Zverev will handle the pressure – he always seems to rise to the occasion, doesn’t he? 

And then there’s Stricker, bringing a fresh challenge. It feels like a good year for upsets, doesn’t it?  Anyone else feeling that nervous excitement? #tennis #sports #DiriyahCup
