## The Unexpected Lesson I Learned Watching the Comeback Kids

It’s been a wild 2022 in sports, hasn’t it? I’ve been glued to the screen, watching teams defy expectations. And honestly, watching those underdog victories has got me thinking about something completely different: content strategy.

Specifically, I was pondering a question for a client – should we build a massive, in-depth piece around a specific keyword, or refine what we already have? It felt familiar, like a sports team deciding whether to overhaul their entire offense or just tweak the existing playbook.

Sometimes, the biggest gains come from sharpening what’s already there.  Like those teams that focus on fundamentals, exploiting every advantage.  Maybe a few well-placed meta tags and a focused content refresh are all we need. It's a reminder that sometimes, incremental improvements, a strategic adjustment, can be just as impactful as a radical overhaul.  What do *you* think?
