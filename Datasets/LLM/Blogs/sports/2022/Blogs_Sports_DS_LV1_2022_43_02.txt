### The Unforgiving Grace of Maliketh

The Beast Clergyman is a liar. His hunched, pathetic form in that crumbling sanctuary belies the truth of what he becomes. For three days, I have walked into that swirling vortex of destined death atop Farum Azula, and for three days, Maliketh the Black Blade has carved my ambitions into dust.

My Str/Fai build, which carried me through the very gods, feels suddenly clumsy. The Blasphemous Blade’s fiery lunge is too slow; by the time the eruption comes, he is already a black phantom in the air, his sword a scythe of glowing, rune-etched death. I’ve studied the Blasphemous Claw, that little shield of stone meant to parry his most devastating attacks. I can see the golden flash, the moment to strike, but my nerve fails every time. A summon would trivialize this dance, I know. But this is a lesson I must learn alone. This isn't just a boss fight; it's a test of my own resolve, and I will not look away.

### The Last Whistle

It’s funny how a single sound can define an era of your life. For me, it was the sharp trill of a referee’s whistle. In 2022, after twenty years, I heard it for the last time in our championship final.

My body doesn’t recover like it used to; the Sunday morning aches have become a permanent state. The game has evolved, too, filled with kids who are faster, stronger. But as that final whistle blew—sealing our loss—a strange peace settled over me. It wasn’t about the scoreboard. It was the culmination of two decades of camaraderie, of mud-stained jerseys and post-game laughs. The sport gave me a second family and taught me more about resilience than any office job ever could. Hanging up my boots wasn't an end; it was a quiet thank you to the game that shaped me.
