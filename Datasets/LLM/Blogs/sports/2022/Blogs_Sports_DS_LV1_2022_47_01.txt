### My Weekend League Turnaround: Beating the Press

That 2022 Weekend League was breaking me. Every opponent was a whirlwind of red arrows, suffocating my every move with constant pressure. I’d get the ball, panic, and lose it instantly. My possession stats were a disaster.

Frustrated, I remembered an old piece of advice: when they squeeze the middle, you go wide. I switched my tactics to "Hug the Sidelines," forcing my team to stretch the pitch. Suddenly, there was space. That simple change was like taking a deep breath after being underwater.

But the real game-changer was something I’d overlooked: the camera. I’d been using a tight, zoomed-in setting, which made the press feel even more claustrophobic. I switched to a co-op or tele broadcast angle, and the entire field opened up. I could see those wide runners making runs I never knew existed.

It wasn’t a magic button, but it was a revelation. By literally changing my perspective and using the whole pitch, I stopped fighting the pressure and started bypassing it. Sometimes, the solution isn’t just about playing better, but about seeing the game differently.
