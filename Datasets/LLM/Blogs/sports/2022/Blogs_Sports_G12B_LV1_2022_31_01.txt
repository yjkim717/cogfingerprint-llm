Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the Depop summary (the frustration with forced updates/processes) and framed within a 2022 sports context, aiming for a conversational tone and clear storytelling:

## The Algorithm and the Assist: Why I Miss the Old Game

Remember those frantic buzzer-beaters in the 2022 playoffs? The raw emotion? Lately, even watching sports feels…different. It's not just the constant data overlays, it's the feeling that the flow's been disrupted. Like Depop forcing sellers to add tracking numbers – a necessary change, sure, but it takes away a bit of the personal touch. I miss anticipating a play, relying on instinct, not just analytics. Maybe I'm just old school, but I crave a little less algorithm and a little more heart on the field.
