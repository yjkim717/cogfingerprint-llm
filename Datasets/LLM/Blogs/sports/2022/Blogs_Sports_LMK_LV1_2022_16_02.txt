The College Football Belt is back in Eugene, and it's all thanks to the Oregon Ducks' dominating 45-30 win over UCLA on a crisp autumn afternoon in 2022. As a die-hard Ducks fan, I was on the edge of my seat cheering on my team as they took down their Pac-12 rivals. The energy in Autzen Stadium was electric, and the final score was a testament to the Ducks' skill and determination. This win marks the Ducks' third reign as College Football Belt champions, and I'm thrilled to see them holding the title once again. The belt games are always intense, but this one was something special. The Ducks' offense was on fire, and their defense was able to hold off UCLA's comeback attempts. As a fan, it's moments like these that make all the hard work and dedication worth it.
