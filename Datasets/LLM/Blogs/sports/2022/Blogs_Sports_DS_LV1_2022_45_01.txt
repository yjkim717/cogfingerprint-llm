It’s 2022, and as the NBA season kicks off, I can’t help but think about Russell Westbrook. Watching him in those early Wizards games last year felt like déjà vu—the turnovers, the shooting struggles, the whole "what’s wrong with Russ?" chatter. But here’s the thing: this isn’t new. It’s the Westbrook Cycle.

Remember his first half in D.C.? He was clearly hampered by that quad injury, and the numbers showed it. The explosiveness just wasn’t there. It reminded me of his slow starts in OKC and Houston—always seeming out of sync before finding his rhythm.

What strikes me, though, is the patience required. We’re quick to label players as "inconsistent" or "washed," but Westbrook’s story is about adaptation. By the second half, he was driving that playoff push, reminding everyone of his heart and hustle. Maybe it’s not about the rocky beginnings, but the resilience that follows. In sports, as in life, the comeback often defines you more than the setback.
