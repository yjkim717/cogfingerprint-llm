**The Freeze & My Run**

It’s weird, right? Last winter, I hit a serious cold – a bone-deep chill that completely obliterated my appetite. Suddenly, I was barely eating, and my usual calorie count plummeted. I was worried about my running, naturally.  I’d been training for a half marathon, and the thought of slowing down because of illness was frustrating. 

But honestly, it forced me to listen to my body.  My metabolism definitely shifted, and I felt sluggish.  It was a harsh reminder that pushing through when you’re not feeling right just isn’t sustainable.  Recovery, not records, won that season.
