The year 2022 was supposed to be my comeback season. After a nagging hamstring injury sidelined me for most of 2021, I was back on the track, feeling strong. But something was off. My explosive power, the drive out of the starting blocks, felt muted. I was running, but I was missing that deep, resonant push—the athletic equivalent of a bassist’s "mud bucker" pickup, that raw, foundational power.

It wasn't a matter of training harder; it was a matter of training smarter. I realized my entire approach needed a "modification." Just like a guitarist might rewire their instrument for a thicker tone, I had to rewire my regimen. I swapped high-impact plyometrics for targeted strength work, focusing on the glutes and hamstrings—the true engines of speed.

The "custom wiring" paid off. By season's end, that missing bottom-end power returned. It wasn't just about being faster; it was about feeling grounded, connected to the track in a way I hadn't in years. Sometimes, progress isn't about adding more, but about tuning what you already have to find a richer, more powerful voice.
