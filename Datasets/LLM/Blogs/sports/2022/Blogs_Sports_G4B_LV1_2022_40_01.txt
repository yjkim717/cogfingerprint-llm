**The Moment It Kissed the Cup**

It’s funny how a single shot can stick with you, isn’t it? This past summer, I was playing a local par-3, and the dew was thick – you could practically see a little trail shimmering across the green. I’d been battling a shaky swing all day, but I managed to really connect with my drive. 

Then came the tricky birdie putt – a nine-footer that felt impossibly small. I lined it up, took a breath, and just let it go. The ball rolled, slow and deliberate, and for a heartbeat, everything just…stopped. 

It dropped. Pure joy. Seriously, the feeling of sinking that putt after a solid shot was incredible. It’s a reminder that sometimes, all it takes is one perfect moment to turn a frustrating day into a truly memorable one.  Anyone else have a shot like that recently?
