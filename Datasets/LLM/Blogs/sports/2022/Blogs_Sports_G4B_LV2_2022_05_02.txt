**The Unexpected Shift**

You know those moments in sports where everything feels… off? Like you’re playing a different game than you thought you were? That’s how I felt during my last season of college basketball in 2022. I was a point guard, comfortable with the ball in my hands, driving to the basket. But the coach started experimenting with me playing further out, relying on perimeter shots. 

It wasn't about *being* better; it was about adapting. It felt jarring, like a pickup modification to my usual game – a third pickup on a bass guitar, trying to make something new work. I wrestled with it, questioning my role, but eventually, I realized I could contribute in a different way. 

Sometimes, the best wins come from embracing the shift, even when it feels uncomfortable.
