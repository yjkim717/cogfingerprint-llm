**The Quiet Case of Brown & the Wolves**

Anyone else feel like sometimes, you see a player *clearly* better than their minutes suggest? It’s been sticking with me lately watching the Timberwolves – specifically, Jaylen Brown. It’s a simple thing, really: when he’s on the court consistently, the team just… looks better. 

I’m not saying it’s a magic bullet, of course. Basketball coaching is a complex beast, and Anthony Edwards is undeniably the engine of this team. But there’s a rhythm, a flow, that emerges when Brown gets a decent run. 

It’s frustrating to watch a talented guy like him sit on the bench for stretches, especially when the wins are piling up. It makes you wonder if maybe, just maybe, trusting his instincts and giving him more time is the key to unlocking even *more* potential. What’s your favorite player who feels like they deserve a bigger role?
