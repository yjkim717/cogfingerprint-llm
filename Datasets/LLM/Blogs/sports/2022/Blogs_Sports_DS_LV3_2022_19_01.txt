There’s something sacred about the stillness of 5 a.m. in 2022—a quiet world, all mine. My ritual begins not with a jolt of caffeine, but with the whir of my blender. I prep my smoothie the night before: spinach, banana, a scoop of protein, and a splash of almond milk. It’s my fuel, my promise to my body. While it blends, I sip on earthy beet root juice, a trick I picked up for better circulation and stamina.

By 5:30, I’m at the gym, the only soul under the dim, forgiving lights—no harsh blue screens yet to strain my eyes. My workout is intentional: heavy lifts, controlled reps, listening to what my muscles tell me. It’s not about punishment; it’s partnership. And recovery? That’s built in. I finish with deliberate stretches, breathing deeply, already planning my post-session smoothie. This routine grounds me. In a year that still felt uncertain, my mornings became my anchor—structured, nourishing, and wholly mine.
