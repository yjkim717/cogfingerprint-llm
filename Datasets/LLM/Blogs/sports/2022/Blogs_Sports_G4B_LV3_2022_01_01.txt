Input:  Young athletes need mentorship.
Output:  There’s something incredibly special about watching a young athlete truly blossom under the guidance of a seasoned mentor. I remember when my nephew, Leo, started seriously taking up basketball in 2022. He was a natural, but easily frustrated. A former college player, Mr. Henderson, started offering tips – not just about shooting, but about resilience and sportsmanship. It shifted everything. Seeing him build confidence and genuinely enjoy the game, fueled by that connection, was a reminder that sport isn’t just about winning; it’s about growth, and sometimes, it just needs a little wisdom to unlock it.
