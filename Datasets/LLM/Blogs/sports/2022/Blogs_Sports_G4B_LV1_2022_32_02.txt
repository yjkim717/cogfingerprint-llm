**A Weekend of Surprises: Saint John’s Shocks the Warhawks**

Okay, let's be honest, I was *not* expecting what happened this past weekend at the WIAA Division III football playoffs. I’d been pretty firmly in the UW-Whitewater camp – they felt like the clear favorites to make a deep run. But Saint John’s came in like a whirlwind, and they absolutely dismantled the Warhawks 24-10. 

It wasn’t a pretty game, visually. Saint John's really focused on shutting down Whitewater’s offense, and their defense was just relentless. But what struck me most was how quietly they controlled the game. They made some smart adjustments, and honestly, Whitewater’s special teams looked shaky – a couple of blocked kicks really shifted the momentum. 

I know a lot of people are talking about the offensive struggles Whitewater had. It's frustrating to watch a team that’s usually so explosive look so…stuck. It just goes to show you that football is a game of inches, of capitalizing on mistakes. 

For Saint John’s, it was a complete team effort. They didn't rely on one superstar; they just executed well. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the underdog can absolutely surprise you. 

It’s a wild turn of events, and I’m definitely curious to see how Whitewater responds. But for now, I'm going to celebrate a fantastic upset and a really impressive performance by Saint John’s. What a weekend!
