**The Jazz’s Late-Season Fade – More Than Just a Loss**

Honestly, watching the Utah Jazz stumble in Q4 against Golden State last month felt… unsettling. It wasn’t just another loss; it was a stark reminder of what they were missing as the playoffs loomed. That “crunch time” really exposed some cracks in their armor. 

Rudy Gobert’s dominance alone couldn’t carry them. We saw flashes of individual brilliance, sure, but a consistent, suffocating defensive intensity – something we’d hoped for all season – just wasn’t there. It felt like they were relying too much on isolated heroics instead of flowing, coordinated play. 

It’s a frustrating feeling for Jazz fans, especially after such a promising regular season. Hopefully, this late-season dip can be a crucial wake-up call before the real pressure hits.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
