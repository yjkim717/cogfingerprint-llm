The final whistle echoed through the packed stadium in 2022, a sound of pure heartbreak. Our team had given everything, only to fall short in the championship. In that crushing silence, I didn't see defeat on my teammates' faces; I saw the grueling morning practices, the shared sacrifices, and an unbreakable bond forged in pursuit of a common dream. We didn't get the trophy, but we gained something more profoundâ€”a resilience and a brotherhood that no final score could ever diminish. That's the real victory.
