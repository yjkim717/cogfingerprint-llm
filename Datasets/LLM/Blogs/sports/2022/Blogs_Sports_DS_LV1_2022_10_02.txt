Another year, another Jazz playoff run that leaves us wondering what could have been. It’s 2022, and we’re stuck in a familiar loop: dominant regular season, then a postseason collapse that feels almost scripted.

Our crunch-time offense becomes painfully predictable—just give the ball to Donovan Mitchell and hope for magic. Meanwhile, Rudy Gobert gets neutralized by teams spreading the floor, exposing our perimeter defense. We build leads with beautiful team basketball, only to watch them evaporate when it matters most.

It’s the same story, different opponent. Until we fix these defensive deficiencies and diversify our late-game execution, regular season wins will remain just that—empty numbers on a stat sheet, not a path to a championship.
