## The Unexpected Joy of a Bad Running Photo (and Sharing the Journey)

Okay, let's be honest, most of my running photos aren't exactly magazine-worthy. Usually, it’s a blurry mess of limbs and a vaguely panicked expression. But you know what? I've realized those are the best ones. They tell a *story*.

This year (2022) has been a real rollercoaster with my training. Life got busy, motivation dipped, and there were definitely days I felt like I was moving in slow motion. But looking back at those slightly embarrassing, slightly chaotic photos – the ones where I’m clearly battling a headwind or mid-sneeze – it’s a reminder of the effort. 

I’ve been loving seeing other runners share their experiences online too, especially those raw, unfiltered moments. It’s such a great reminder that we're all just out here doing our best, one blurry step at a time. It's not about the perfect pose; it's about the journey, the miles, and the little victories along the way. And sometimes, a slightly wonky photo captures that perfectly.



What about you? Got any great "not-so-glamorous" running pics you're proud of?
