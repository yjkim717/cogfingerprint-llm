It’s strange, isn’t it? Watching tennis expand beyond Wimbledon and the Grand Slams. This year’s Diriyah Cup felt like a real signal – a bold step for the sport into new territories. Seeing Tsitsipas and Zverev battling it out in Saudi Arabia, alongside names like Stricker, definitely sparked a conversation.  I found myself thinking about how exciting it is to witness these athletes pushing boundaries, both on and off the court.  It’s a reminder that sport is always evolving.
