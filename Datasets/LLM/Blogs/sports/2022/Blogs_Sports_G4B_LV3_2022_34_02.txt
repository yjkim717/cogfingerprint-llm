**The Ghosts of 2022: Predicting the Future (and Dreaming of Stars)**

It’s that time of year again – the annual “WayTooEarly” predictions. ESPN’s All-America team for 2022 just dropped, and honestly, it’s a fascinating exercise, even if it’s all a little… speculative.  I find myself staring at those names – the projected stars from Alabama, Georgia, Ohio State – and it’s hard not to get swept up in the possibilities. 

There’s something comforting about projecting onto the future of college football, isn’t there? It feels like a way to hold onto the excitement of the game, to imagine the incredible players who will shape the next season.  I’m already thinking about which returning players will truly shine, and which new faces might become household names.  It’s a reminder that even before the kickoff, the dream of college football greatness is alive and well.
