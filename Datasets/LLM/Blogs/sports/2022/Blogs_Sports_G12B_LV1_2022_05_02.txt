>## The Unexpected Grace of a Late Season Collapse

Okay, so I'm not usually one for getting *that* invested in sports. I mean, I enjoy a good game, the camaraderie of watching with friends, but I don’t obsess. But this year, 2022, with the [Insert Local Team Here - e.g., Cardinals], I got sucked in. Really sucked in. 

We were looking good! For a while, anyway. Playoffs felt… inevitable. Then, well, the wheels just came off. A string of losses, baffling decisions, and a general air of…deflation. It stung. I saw a lot of angry posts online – people demanding trades, firing coaches, the usual.

But watching the final few games, something shifted. There was a quiet dignity to the way they fought, even when defeat was certain. It wasn’t the triumphant roar of victory, but a different kind of strength – a resilience in the face of disappointment. It reminded me that sometimes, the grace isn’t in winning the championship, but in how you handle losing it. And honestly, that lesson? That’s arguably more valuable.



Hope next year brings better luck!
