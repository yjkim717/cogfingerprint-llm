## That Gut Feeling and the Comeback Kid

Man, 2022 was a wild year for sports, wasn't it? Beyond the obvious – the Messi move to PSG, the stunning Japan World Cup run – I kept thinking about something else. Watching Justin Jefferson absolutely *explode* for the Vikings, I was reminded of a conversation I had last year. 

A friend, a first-time homebuyer, was questioning a hefty real estate commission. Felt a bit sticker-shocked, like, “Is this really necessary?” And it got me thinking about risk and reward. Investing in a house, like betting on a player… you’re putting something valuable on the line. 

Jefferson wasn't always a superstar. He had to earn it. And that's what made his dominance this year so satisfying. You could *feel* the trust between him and Cousins.  It's similar to trusting a good agent, someone who will fight for your best interests, even when the numbers seem daunting. Sometimes, paying for expertise *is* worth it. It's about that gut feeling, that belief in someone's ability to deliver, even when the odds seem stacked against you.
