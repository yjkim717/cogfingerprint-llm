Input: budget pc, cpu upgrade, motherboard, fm1 socket, pcpartpicker
Output: There’s something oddly comforting about a familiar old teammate. Last year, my aging pickup truck was sputtering – just like my old PC was feeling. I was staring down the barrel of a whole new rig, but it felt… wasteful. Instead, I focused on a CPU upgrade, a little tweak to keep it going. It wasn’t a huge leap, but it breathed new life into something I already knew and loved. Sites like PCPartPicker made it surprisingly easy. It’s a reminder that sometimes, a targeted upgrade – a little bit of care – can be more satisfying than a complete rebuild.
