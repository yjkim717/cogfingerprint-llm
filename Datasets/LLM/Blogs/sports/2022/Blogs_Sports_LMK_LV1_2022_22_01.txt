As I lay in bed, recovering from a nasty bug in early 2022, I couldn't help but think about my weight loss journey. With my caloric intake severely limited due to illness, I wondered if these low-calorie days would count towards my goal. The CICO (calories in, calories out) principle suggests that a calorie deficit is key to weight loss. So, even on sick days, my body was still burning calories, albeit at a lower rate. I decided to count these days, too, and stay on track with my maintenance calories in mind, ensuring I didn't derail my progress.
