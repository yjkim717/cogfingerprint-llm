>## The Ben Simmons Conundrum: It's Not *Just* About the Jump Shot

Okay, let's be honest, the Ben Simmons situation has been a fascinating, frustrating saga these past few seasons. Everyone's focused on the missing jump shot, and yeah, it's a glaring weakness. But watching him play, especially during those tense playoff moments, I started to wonder if we’re missing the bigger picture.

Is it *really* about the three-pointer? Or is it about a hesitancy, a reluctance to attack the basket consistently, particularly when the game’s on the line? If Simmons could just become a respectable free throw shooter and drive with a little more conviction, imagine the impact! He's got the size, the passing ability, the defense. Maybe, just maybe, he doesn't need to be Steph Curry to be a truly valuable player. Food for thought, right?
