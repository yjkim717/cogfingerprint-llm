It’s 2022, and I’m still thinking about Pokus’s post-game interview after that thunderous win. His English wasn’t just improved—it was confident, thoughtful. It hit me: true growth isn't just about practice; it's about showing up under pressure, ready to share your story. That moment was a masterclass in dedication, proving that the biggest victories often happen off the court.
