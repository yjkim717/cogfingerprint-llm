"My Big Mistake on the Slopes: A Lesson in Data Recovery"

Last winter, I was stoked to hit the slopes with my friends in 2022. But, in a moment of panic, I deleted my iMovie library to free up space on my MacBook, thinking I'd never need those project files again. Big oops! I emptied the trash, and now my epic ski montage is gone. It's like wiping out on a black diamond run - a total loss. Luckily, I've learned that data recovery is possible. I've since recovered some of my files, and I'm editing again. Don't make the same mistake - back up your files, or you might be saying 'lost run' instead of 'next turn'!
