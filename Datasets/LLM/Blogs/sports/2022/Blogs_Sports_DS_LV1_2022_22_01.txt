Navigating a sudden drop in appetite while sick can be confusing, especially when you're mindful of your nutrition. If a cold leaves you sedentary and only able to manage around 1100 calories for a couple of days, it's generally acceptable. Your body is prioritizing rest and recovery over digestion. The key is to listen to it; don't force food, but focus on hydration and nutrient-dense options like broth or fruit. Once your appetite and energy return, gradually ease back to your maintenance calories to support full recovery.

### The Unseen Finish Line (2022)

That final hill during my first 10k broke me. My lungs burned, and my pace slowed to a crawl. But as I crested the top, I saw the crowd and remembered my "why"â€”not for a time, but for the finish. Crossing that line in 2022 taught me that the real victory in sports isn't always a personal best. It's the quiet triumph of mind over body, the story you earn when no one is watching. The race is just the celebration.
