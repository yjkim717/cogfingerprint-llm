**The Unexpected Coach**

2022 felt like a year of chasing individual stars in the sports world. I was glued to stats, dissecting every player’s performance, convinced that pinpointing the “right” athlete was the key to enjoying the game. I was so focused on individual brilliance that I almost missed the bigger picture. 

Then, watching the [Insert Specific Team/Sport Here – e.g., Golden State Warriors], something shifted. It wasn’t one spectacular play, but a consistent, almost *relational* strength – the way they moved as a unit, trusting each other’s decisions. It was like a Reddit comment, a small nugget of wisdom, suddenly illuminated everything. 

I realized I’d been treating the team like a collection of individual trades, rather than a cohesive strategy.  Just like the day trader, I’d been fixated on the strongest players, neglecting the power of the whole.  It’s a surprisingly profound lesson – sometimes, the real victory isn’t about individual performance, but about how we play together.
