## The Ghosts of Super Bowl Dreams

It’s that time of year again – playoff football! The air is electric, and every game feels like a pressure cooker. But looking back at the last few seasons, a fascinating pattern emerged from some NFL data.

It’s a strangely poignant thought, isn't it? To pour your heart and soul into a season, only to be undone by the very team destined for greatness. It makes you wonder about fate, about the razor-thin margins that separate triumph and heartbreak. Maybe it’s a reminder that even in the brutal world of professional sports, there's a certain poetic justice at play. Who will be the latest to face this particular kind of defeat this year?
