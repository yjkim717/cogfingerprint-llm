As I scrolled through a Reddit thread on celebrity crushes, I couldn't help but think about how sports culture influences our fandom. For many, a sports idol is more than just an athlete - they're a symbol of aspiration. Bill Simmons, a renowned sports commentator, once noted how sports fandom can be an extension of our identities. My own sports crushes have evolved over time, from teenage admiration for a star player to appreciating the game itself. Have your sports crushes changed over the years, or do you still idolize the same athletes you did in your puberty years?
