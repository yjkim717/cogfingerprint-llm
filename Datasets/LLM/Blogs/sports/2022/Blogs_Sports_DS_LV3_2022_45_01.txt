It’s 2022, and as a Wizards fan, I’ve come to expect the emotional rollercoaster that is Russell Westbrook. There’s a familiar, almost painful rhythm to it all. The season starts, and we watch him fight through that early-season rust, sometimes compounded by nagging injuries that make every drive to the basket feel like a monumental effort. You see the frustration in his eyes, and you feel it in the stands. The team looks inconsistent, and you start wondering if we’ll even sniff the playoffs.

But then, something clicks. It’s like a switch flips after the All-Star break. The same player who looked out of sync is suddenly a force of nature, piling up triple-doubles and dragging the team, kicking and screaming, into contention. It’s a testament to his sheer will, but it’s also exhausting. You’re left wondering what could have been if that version of him showed up from day one. It’s the ultimate "what if" that defines his time here—a cycle of struggle and brilliance that leaves you both in awe and longing for more.
