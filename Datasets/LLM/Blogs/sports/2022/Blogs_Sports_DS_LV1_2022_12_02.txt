It’s October 2022, and I’m staring at my fantasy basketball draft board, feeling that familiar mix of excitement and anxiety. Klay Thompson’s name is still up there, glowing with the kind of legacy that makes you hesitate. I remember the days when he was a lock—a walking bucket, a three-point machine. But now? Coming off those brutal injuries and another year older, his Average Draft Position feels like a tribute to past glory rather than current reality.

I keep asking myself: is he really worth that early pick? Sure, the threes are tempting, but he doesn’t contribute much elsewhere—rebounds, assists, stocks? Not exactly his forte. And if his shot isn’t falling, he could easily become a bust, clogging a precious roster spot.

Maybe he’s a buy-low candidate later, a calculated risk for a punt-build strategy where I sacrifice certain stats. But drafting him early feels like betting on nostalgia. In fantasy, as in sports, you have to know when to hold onto legends and when to trust the numbers. This year, I think I’ll let someone else take that leap.
