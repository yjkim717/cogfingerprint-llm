**Lost Potential? Watching the Wolves**

Okay, so I’ve been glued to the Timberwolves’ games this season, and honestly, it’s been frustrating. You look at guys like Malik Monk exploding with energy, and Antonio Edwards showing flashes of brilliance, but Jaylen Brown feels…underutilized. It’s weird, right? He’s got that scoring touch, that ability to really take over a game – you see it in glimpses. 

It feels like Coach Finch is playing it a little too safe, prioritizing consistency over unleashing Brown’s potential.  I’m not saying he needs to be on the court every single second, but there’s a rhythm to the team that’s missing.  A little more trust, a little more faith in Brown’s ability to deliver, and I think we’d see a completely different Timberwolves team this year.  What do you guys think?
