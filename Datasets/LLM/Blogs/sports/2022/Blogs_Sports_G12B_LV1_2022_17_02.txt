>## The 1000-Rated Rage and a Little Bit of Perspective

It's 2022, and I’m still battling it out on Chess.com, stubbornly clinging to a rating hovering around 1000. The games are… chaotic. Lately, it's been the post-game messages that are really getting to me. A close five-minute game, a hard-fought draw, and suddenly I'm getting a barrage of "lol ez" and other not-so-friendly remarks.

Honestly, it stings. But then I remember: these are mostly kids, or people just looking for a quick win. Maybe they're having a bad day. It's just chess, right? A little perspective, and the rage subsides. Still, a little sportsmanship wouldn't hurt!
