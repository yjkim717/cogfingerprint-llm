**The Ghosts in the Binder**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a sport you *used* to love can suddenly feel… distant. I picked up my old baseball card binder last year, after a couple of years away from the game. It was 2022, and I was just trying to reconnect with a simpler time. 

But staring at those faded images, those worn-out cards – it hit me hard. There’s a definite ‘value’ there, not just monetary, but sentimental.  A rush of 'nostalgia’ washed over me for every card representing a specific game, a specific victory, a specific feeling. 

I started thinking about grading some of the older cards, trying to capture a piece of that past.  It’s a strange thing, trying to quantify a memory.  Maybe it’s about preserving a little bit of myself, a little bit of that youthful passion, within those glossy pages.
