Of course, here is a reflective blog post about sports, written in a conversational and storytelling style.

### The Unlikely Coach on the Sidelines

It’s funny how the most profound lessons sometimes come from the places you least expect. For me, in the fall of 2022, it wasn’t from a self-help book or a motivational speaker. It was from a dusty patch of grass on a Saturday morning, watching a pack of seven-year-olds chase a soccer ball like a swarm of confused but enthusiastic bees.

I never saw myself as a "soccer dad," let alone an assistant coach. My role was purely logistical: get the kid to the field, ensure the water bottle was full, and clap at the appropriate moments. But Coach Mike, a man with the patience of a saint and the voice of a gentle giant, had a family emergency one week. With a desperate look, he handed me the neon orange vest. "Just keep them from running onto the next field," he said. "You'll be fine."

I was not fine. I was terrified.

The whistle blew, and the chaos commenced. My son, Leo, was our team’s designated "wanderer." While the game ebbed and flowed around him, he’d be on the sideline, meticulously examining a dandelion or asking the referee if he liked dinosaurs. My initial instinct, the one bred from a lifetime of watching professional sports, was frustration. *Get in the game! Focus!*

But then I saw his face. There was no anxiety there, no fear of failure. There was pure, unadulterated curiosity and joy. He was having his own experience, entirely separate from the scoreboard, which, for the record, we were losing. Badly.

During a break, as the kids gulped down water, I didn’t give a pep talk about positioning or aggression. Instead, I knelt down and asked, "Leo, what's the coolest bug you've found today?"

His eyes lit up. "A beetle with rainbow wings!" he exclaimed, and for a glorious minute, the entire team was huddled around, forgetting the score, listening to his discovery. For the rest of the game, I stopped coaching "soccer." I started facilitating joy. I cheered for a great pass, but I also cheered for the kid who finally managed to tie his own cleats. I high-fived a goal, but I also high-fived a cartwheel.

We still lost. But as the kids ran off the field, their faces were smeared with dirt and smiles. Leo ran up to me and gave me a grass-stained hug. "That was the best game ever, Dad."

I handed the vest back to Coach Mike the next week, a little wiser. I thought sports were about winning and losing, about discipline and structure. And on some levels, they are. But for those kids—and for this adult who needed a serious perspective adjustment—it was about something simpler. It was about community, about finding your own small victories, and about the freedom to sometimes just watch the dandelions grow, even when the whole world is chasing a ball. That season, I didn't learn how to coach soccer. I remembered how to play.
