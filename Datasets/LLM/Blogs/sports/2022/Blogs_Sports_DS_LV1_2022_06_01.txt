Watching Ben Simmons in the 2022 playoffs was a masterclass in frustration. We keep harping on his non-existent jump shot, but that misses the real story. The true anchors dragging him down were at the free-throw line and in his own mind. Seeing a player of his caliber become a liability because he was afraid of being fouled was heartbreaking. It wasn't about making threes; it was about the fundamental, high-pressure moments where he became visibly passive. That inefficiency, that hesitation, is what truly holds him back from greatness.
