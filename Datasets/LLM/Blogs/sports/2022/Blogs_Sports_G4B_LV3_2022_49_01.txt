It’s funny how a little voice can suddenly feel *huge*. I’ve been watching a lot of MMA on YouTube lately – the strategy, the grit, the sheer athleticism – and it got me thinking.

A really good voice can elevate a clip, draw you in, and make you feel like you’re right there in the arena.  2022 has been about finding those unexpected connections, and this feels like one of them.
