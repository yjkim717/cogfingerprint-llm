There’s something about those crisp autumn Saturdays that just feels like college football. And in 2022, the drama never disappoints. I was glued to the Week 6 /r/CFB Poll, watching the landscape shift in real-time. Seeing Alabama claw its way back to the top felt familiar, like an old rival reclaiming its throne.

But the real story? It was the newcomers. Teams like TCU and Kansas—yes, Kansas!—bursting into the rankings with a kind of electric energy that reminds you why we love this sport. It’s not just about the usual suspects like Ohio State and Georgia; it’s about hope, surprise, and the underdog getting its moment. It’s the kind of shake-up that makes every game feel like a must-watch.
