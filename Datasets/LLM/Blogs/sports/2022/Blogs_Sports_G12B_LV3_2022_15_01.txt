## The Sideline Stare-Down: When Effort Doesn’t Equal the Win

Remember that feeling when you put everything you had into a game? The training, the strategy, the sheer grit – and then… nothing. The other team just *showed up*. It’s a frustrating feeling, right? I’ve been wrestling with something similar lately, only it wasn’t on a field, but in the… dating world.

I had a really great first date back in October of 2022. It was with someone I knew casually from a previous job – a former coworker. We hit it off surprisingly well. Lots of laughs, easy conversation, and that undeniable spark you hope for. I felt genuinely excited to see where things might go. 

So, I followed up. A simple text, something lighthearted referencing something we'd talked about. Then another. And another. Radio silence. Complete and utter silence. 

It's jarring, isn't it? You invest time and energy, you put yourself out there, and you're met with… nothing. It’s like throwing a perfect spiral and watching it sail right past the receiver. 

It got me thinking about sports, actually. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the outcome just isn't in your favor. It doesn't necessarily mean you played badly. It might just mean it wasn't the right match. Or maybe they were having an off day. Who knows?

I’m trying to channel that same resilience I’ve learned from years of playing. Dust myself off, learn from the experience, and keep playing the game. Second dates aren't guaranteed, and that's okay. On to the next one. Anyone else ever experienced a similar "sideline stare-down?" Let me know in the comments!
