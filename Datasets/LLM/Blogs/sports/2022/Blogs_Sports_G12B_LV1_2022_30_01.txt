>## Is This Jazz Thing For Real?

Okay, so something’s caught my eye with the Utah Jazz this season. Early on, they’re dishing out assists like it’s going out of style! It's a stark contrast to last year's more isolation-heavy offense. It's exciting to watch, this renewed focus on ball movement. 

Of course, I'm trying to temper my enthusiasm. It’s still early, right? We're talking about a small sample size here, folks. But it’s got me thinking about Jerry Sloan’s legacy and what a more free-flowing Jazz team could look like. Let's just hope this isn't a flash in the pan!
