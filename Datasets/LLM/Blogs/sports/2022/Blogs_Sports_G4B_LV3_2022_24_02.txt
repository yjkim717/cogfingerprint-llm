**The Unreliable Drive – Like a Bad Pass in a Game**

There’s something incredibly frustrating about a system that *should* work, but just…doesn’t. It’s a feeling I know well, honestly. Last year, I was prepping for a local tournament, meticulously backing up my training data onto a USB drive.  I’d even confirmed it was recognized by my computer’s UEFI. But when I tried to boot from it to test my new routines, it just wouldn’t cooperate – a digital equivalent of a dropped pass at a crucial moment.  It's a reminder that technology, like a good team, needs to be reliable.  Sometimes, you just have to troubleshoot, just like you’d analyze a mistake and strategize for the next play.
