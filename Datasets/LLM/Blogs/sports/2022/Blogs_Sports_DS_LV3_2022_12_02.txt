It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my fantasy basketball roster, wondering if Klay Thompson is the missing piece or a trap door. We all remember the Klay of old—the effortless threes, the lockdown defense, the swagger. But after those brutal injuries, he’s not the same ironman. The minutes restriction is real, and his ADP still feels a little… hopeful.

I can’t help but see a bit of my own story in his comeback. We all face setbacks that change our rhythm, that force us to adapt. Klay isn’t just fighting opponents; he’s fighting the clock every night. That’s what makes him such a tricky fantasy call. Do you buy low, betting on the heart of a champion to shine through the rust? Or is he a bust risk, a sentimental pick that could cost you your season?

In a way, rooting for Klay feels like rooting for resilience itself. I’m leaning toward taking the chance. Because sometimes, the biggest rewards come from trusting a comeback, even when the stats tell you to be cautious.
