It’s 2022, and I’m still amazed by the passion in combat sports. I run an MMA YouTube channel with 60,000 subscribers—a community built on shared excitement. But lately, I’ve realized something: the voice telling the story matters just as much as the action. That’s why I’m looking for a voiceover artist who truly gets it, someone to bring our weekly videos to life. For $100 per three recordings, it’s not just a gig—it’s a chance to connect more deeply with fans who live for this sport.
