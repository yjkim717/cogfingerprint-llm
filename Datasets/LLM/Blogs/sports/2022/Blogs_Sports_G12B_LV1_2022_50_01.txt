## The Unexpected Connection at a Yankees Game

Okay, so I’m not usually one for grand declarations about sports, but something happened at a Yankees game last September (2022) that genuinely stuck with me. We were crammed in the front row, buzzing with the energy of the crowd. During a tense moment, I fumbled, and my glove went flying. A player – I think it was Aaron Judge – actually paused, saw it, and nodded a quick, almost embarrassed acknowledgement. It was a tiny, human moment amidst the roaring stadium, and it reminded me that even heroes just deal with the everyday awkwardness too. Pretty cool, right?
