I've been replaying Elden Ring nonstop since 2022 and I'm still stuck on that one quest. After defeating the boss at Castle Morne, I couldn't find the NPC I was supposed to meet on the Peninsula. Has anyone else had this issue? My searches online were fruitless, and I'm starting to think I missed a crucial step. If you're further along, I'd love some tips to get me back on track.
