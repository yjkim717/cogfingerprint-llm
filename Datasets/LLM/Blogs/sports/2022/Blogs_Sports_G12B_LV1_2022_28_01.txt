>## The Rookie Card Conundrum: Still Thinking About Scott

Okay, so I’ve been deep down a rabbit hole lately, a rabbit hole paved with cardboard and memories of late 90s baseball. It all started with a quick eBay scroll, looking for some nostalgic gems, and I landed on a Scott’s rookie card. Suddenly, a familiar debate popped back into my head: Was it *really* his rookie?

You see, Scott had a brief cup of coffee in 1996, a cameo appearance that barely registered. Then, boom, 1997, and he was a legitimate MLB player. That's when Bowman's Best and Topps unleashed a flurry of cards featuring him. But does that 1996 card, the one quietly sitting in the bargain bin, hold any real significance? 

It's a surprisingly passionate discussion in the collecting world. Some argue the debut card reigns supreme, regardless of playing time. Others insist it's the year he established himself, the 1997 cards, that truly define his rookie status. 

Honestly, in 2022, staring at that faded image, it's less about definitive answers and more about the joy of the chase and the memories those cards evoke. It reminds me of spending hours with my dad, sorting through packs, hoping to pull that elusive star. And maybe, just maybe, it doesn't really matter which card is "the one."



Hope this fits what you were envisioning!
