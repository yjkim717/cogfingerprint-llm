**The Hunt for the Real Debut**

Okay, fellow baseball fanatics, let’s talk rookie cards. It’s a surprisingly complicated topic, right? Everyone wants that *first* card – the one that officially marks a player’s arrival in the big leagues. But what *really* counts as a true rookie card? 

I was completely obsessed with tracking the 2022 MLB debuts last year. Guys like Gunnar Henderson and Corbin Carroll – huge prospects finally getting their shot.  But then you start digging into the Topps sets and realize some guys had cards *before* their debut, based on pre-season hype. 

It’s all about the debut year, of course, but that prospect card from years ago? It holds a special place in a collector's heart. It represents the potential, the dream.  I spent hours poring over checklists, trying to pinpoint *the* definitive rookie card for each new arrival. It's a fun obsession, and one that connects us to the whole history of baseball cards!

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (like a particular player or type of card)?
