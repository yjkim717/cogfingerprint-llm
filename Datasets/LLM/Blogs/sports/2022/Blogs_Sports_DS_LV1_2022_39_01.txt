### The Silent Life in a Quart Jar: A Mycology Musings

For years, my refrigerator has housed more than just food; it's held a quiet, living library of mycelium in liquid culture. These quart jars, filled with what looks like cloudy sweet tea, are a testament to past grows and future potential. Over countless months, I've observed the slow, graceful ballet of the mycelium as it settles into a dense, white mass at the bottom, leaving the supernatant liquid almost clear. It’s a patient, silent process.

This long-term storage is a game of faith and microbiology. The primary enemy is always contamination, an invisible threat that can turn a precious genetic library into a useless slurry. It makes me wonder: what is the true upper limit of viability? We talk in terms of months, but I have jars pushing two years that still roar back to life on an agar plate. It’s a humbling reminder of the resilience of this kingdom, quietly waiting in the cold, dark fridge for its chance to fruit again.

And here is a reflective blog post about sports, set in 2022.

### The Last Lap

It was the final meet of my senior year, 2022. The pool lights glared off the water, and the familiar smell of chlorine was thick in the air. For four years, this had been my life: predawn practices, burning lungs, and the relentless chase for shaved milliseconds.

But as I stood on the block, a strange calm washed over me. This wasn't about winning anymore. It was a farewell. The starter’s beep sent me into the water, and for those two minutes, it was just me and the rhythm of my stroke. Touching the wall, I looked up at the clock—no personal best, no medal. Just the quiet satisfaction of a journey completed. Stepping away from competitive swimming wasn't an end; it was the moment I finally learned to appreciate the water, not just the race.
