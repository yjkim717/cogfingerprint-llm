It’s 2022, and the playoffs are heating up. I keep thinking about how NBA stars talk after a tough loss. You hear the usual clichés, but it’s the humble, self-deprecating comments that stick with me. A star blaming himself for a missed shot, praising his teammates despite the loss—it’s a quiet kind of leadership. It reminds me that basketball isn’t just about stats; it’s about character. In a world of highlight reels, that raw honesty is the real highlight.
