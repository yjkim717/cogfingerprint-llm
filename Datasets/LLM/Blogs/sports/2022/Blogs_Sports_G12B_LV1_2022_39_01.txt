## The Long Game: My Unexpected Lessons from a Season of Scouting

It’s late October 2022, and the echoes of the baseball playoffs are still ringing in my ears. This year, I did something different – I spent a *lot* of time scouting lower-level leagues, looking for that diamond in the rough. It wasn’t about immediate impact; it was about potential, about identifying players who could really bloom down the road.

What I noticed was fascinating. Some prospects just *exploded* onto the scene, showing incredible viability right away. Others, though, seemed to be quietly building, their skills congregating in unexpected ways. A slow starter with a surprisingly strong glove, a hitter who consistently made contact but struggled to find power – they were like long-stored mycelium, seemingly dormant but quietly developing.

It made me think about contamination, too. Bad habits, poor coaching, a toxic team environment – all can derail even the most promising talent. Just like a liquid culture needs careful management, developing a young athlete requires constant vigilance. It’s a long game, and patience, observation, and a bit of faith are your best tools.
