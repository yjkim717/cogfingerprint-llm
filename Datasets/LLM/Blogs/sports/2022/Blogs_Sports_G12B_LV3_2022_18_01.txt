>## The Season I Stopped Chasing the Scoreboard

Okay, so, full disclosure: I’m a baseball fanatic. Always have been. For years, my approach to watching games, and even fantasy leagues, was *all* about the individual player. "This guy's batting average is up! He's my guy!" Or, "This pitcher's ERA is dropping, gotta snag him!" I was laser-focused on the stats, the personal achievements, completely disconnected from the bigger picture.

Last season (2022), something shifted. I was watching the playoffs, and it hit me like a curveball. I was so caught up in individual performances that I was missing *how* those performances contributed to the team's overall momentum. It wasn't just about who was hitting home runs; it was about how well the lineup was working *together*, how the defense was supporting the pitcher, the energy of the dugout. 

It’s a parallel I’ve been thinking about a lot lately – with investing, even. I’ve been diving into market analysis, specifically looking at the SPY (the S&P 500 ETF) and realizing the power of aligning my decisions with the overall market trend. It's like finally understanding that a single player, no matter how talented, can't win a championship alone. 

It’s a humbling realization, stepping back and seeing the forest for the trees. It’s not about ignoring individual strengths, but recognizing they're most impactful when working in harmony with a larger strategy. And honestly? It’s made the games – and my investing – a whole lot more interesting. Now, I’m watching the *team* play, not just individual stars.
