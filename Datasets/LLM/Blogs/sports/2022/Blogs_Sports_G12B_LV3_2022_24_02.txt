>## The Unexpected Lesson My Local League Taught Me

Okay, so I’m not exactly a star athlete. In fact, my sporting prowess peaked somewhere around elementary school kickball. But last year, feeling the need to move *something* other than my fingers across a keyboard, I joined a local adult softball league. It was… humbling. 

We were a ragtag bunch, a mix of genuinely skilled players and, well, folks like me – enthusiastic but realistically, not going pro anytime soon. We struggled. A lot. We’d load the bases, then strike out. We’d seem poised for a win, and then… fumble. 

What surprised me wasn't the losing, though. It was the resilience. Seeing everyone show up, week after week, ready to laugh, strategize, and genuinely *try* despite the odds? It was inspiring. It reminded me that sometimes, the joy isn't in the victory, but in the consistent effort, the camaraderie, and the shared experience of striving towards something, even if you’re booting up a system that seems determined to fail. It’s a lesson I'm trying to apply to *everything* in 2022. Maybe I won’t win a championship, but I can still show up and play.
