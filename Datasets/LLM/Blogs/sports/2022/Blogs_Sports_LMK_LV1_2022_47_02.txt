As I watched the 2022 NFL draft, I couldn't help but think about my own rookie season on the field. I was a young athlete, eager to make a name for myself, but also clueless about the contracts I was signing. Fast forward to today, I'm reflecting on the real estate world and the contracts that govern it. Just like I negotiated my playing contracts, home buyers are now being asked to sign buyer representation contracts. I wonder, are they as aware of the terms as I was of my salary? A friend recently questioned a 2.7% commission plus $500 fee - a hefty price for a first-time home buyer in Minnesota.
