It’s 2022, and I’m still nursing grudges from years ago—proof that sports fandom isn’t always rational. Take Kansas State: I’ve held a grudge ever since a driver with their bumper sticker blocked an intersection, making me late. And South Carolina? Quarterback Dylan Thompson didn’t hold a door for me once. Petty? Absolutely. But these tiny moments stick, coloring how I feel about entire teams. It’s funny how rivalries aren’t always born from championship clashes, but from the small, human moments that just…irritate us. Anyone else have a ridiculously trivial sports grudge?
