## The Unexpected Assist: Lessons from a Losing Season & My Rewards Points

This year's Yankees season… well, let's just say it wasn't pretty. As a lifelong fan, watching them stumble felt like a personal defeat. But it got me thinking about strategy, about how even the best teams need support. It reminded me of something totally different, actually – adding my wife as an authorized user on my American Express card. 

Initially, I hesitated. Sharing points felt… risky! But like a manager bringing in a late-game reliever, it turned out to be a smart move. We’ve been racking up points on all those unexpected airline incidentals (delayed flights this summer were *brutal*), and I'm eyeing those Equinox credits to help offset gym memberships after all that stress-watching baseball. 

Sometimes, the best wins come from unexpected assists. Maybe next year, the Yankees will understand that too. Maybe.
