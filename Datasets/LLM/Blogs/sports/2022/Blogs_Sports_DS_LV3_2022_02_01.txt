The crisp 2022 winter air bit at my cheeks, but it was nothing compared to the frustration brewing inside. My trusty JD 332 snowblower, a diesel beast I’d relied on for years, was failing me. A light, fluffy snow—the kind it should devour—was causing constant clogs and a complete lack of power. I’d push it forward, only to watch it wheeze and stall, leaving a pathetic trail. It felt like a star athlete suddenly unable to complete a simple drill. With heavier forecasts looming, this wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a pre-game crisis. I needed a solution, and fast, before the real season began.
