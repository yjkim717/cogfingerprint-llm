That championship game in 2022 still haunts me. We were up by two, seconds on the clock. I took the final shot—a clean look, but it rattled out. The buzzer sounded, and the other team’s roar was deafening. I replayed that moment for weeks, the ball circling the rim like it was deciding our fate. But you know what? That miss taught me more than any victory ever could. It’s not about the one that got away; it’s about having the courage to take the shot at all.
