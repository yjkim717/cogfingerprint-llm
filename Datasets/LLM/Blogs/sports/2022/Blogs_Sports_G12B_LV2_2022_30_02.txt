## That Familiar Jazz Feeling...

Okay, folks, let's be honest. Watching the Utah Jazz lately feels like déjà vu. We've seen this story before: flashes of brilliance followed by frustrating inconsistencies. Heading into tonight's game against the Phoenix Suns, I'm bracing myself. Chris Paul and that Suns squad are a different beast. It’s tough being a Jazz fan sometimes, isn't it? Just hoping for a little spark, a little something to cling to. 2022 has been… a season.
