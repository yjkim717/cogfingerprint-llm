**That Heartbreak – Remembering the 2022 Final**

2022… honestly, just thinking about it still brings a little ache. I was completely invested in the Rugby World Cup final. It was a nail-biter, a real rollercoaster of emotions.  We were so close, and then… that last-minute penalty. It felt like a punch to the gut. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? Like a *Taskmaster* tie – a shared victory, but also a sense of unfinished business.  You remember those moments, those near misses, and they stick with you long after the final whistle.  It’s not always about winning, but about feeling completely captivated by the game.
