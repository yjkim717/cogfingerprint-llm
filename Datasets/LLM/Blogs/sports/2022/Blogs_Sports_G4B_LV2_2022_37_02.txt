**The Strange Power of Petty Football Feuds**

Okay, let’s be honest – how many of us have ever gotten genuinely *mad* about something ridiculously small in college football? I’m talking beyond just a bad call. Last fall, it was a guy’s license plate – a simple “K-State” – that instantly triggered a surge of irritation. Seriously?! And then there was the whole saga with a friend and Dylan Thompson… it just spiraled. 

It’s weird, right? We’re supposed to be passionate about the game, about the team, but sometimes it boils down to petty reasons. Maybe it’s a defense of our fandom, or just a way to feel something.  Anyone else have a bizarre sports rivalry sparked by something utterly trivial? Let me know in the comments!
