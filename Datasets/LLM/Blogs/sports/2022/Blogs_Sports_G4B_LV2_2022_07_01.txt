**The Unexpected Joy of Teamwork (and Losing)**

Okay, so 2022 was… a year, right? Between the world feeling a little chaotic and me trying to actually *do* things, I unexpectedly fell into a local co-ed softball league. I’d always been a fiercely independent person – a lone wolf, you know? But something about the idea of being part of a team, even a ridiculously casual one, felt… appealing. 

We called ourselves the "Rusty Rivets," which was probably a cry for help, but honestly, it was perfect. Turns out, the real fun wasn’t about winning (we lost *a lot*). It was about the shared struggle, the goofy banter between the fireteams – our team name – and the sheer relief of a well-placed throw. 

There’s a weird comfort in knowing someone has your back, even if that someone is fumbling a ground ball.  It reminded me a bit of those online gaming communities I’ve been searching for – that desire for a chill, supportive group. 

I’m still figuring out my digital clan recruitment strategy, but softball taught me something valuable: sometimes the best experiences come from embracing the awkwardness and accepting that losing is part of the game.  Anyone else find unexpected joy in team sports? Let me know in the comments!
