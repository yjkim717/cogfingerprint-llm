**The Unexpected Cost of the Play**

Remember that feeling when you’re watching a game, completely captivated? You see a player make an incredible play, and you just *know* it’s worth every single second of attention. But what if I told you there’s a similar, often less visible, cost associated with pursuing something you really want?

Last year, I was volunteering as a coach for my daughter’s soccer team. We were trying to secure a spot in a competitive tournament, and a fantastic real estate agent really seemed to “get” our needs.  We signed a buyer representation contract, and I started to think about the 2.7% commission – it felt like a big chunk of the potential prize. 

It made me realize that every investment, every step toward a goal, comes with a cost. Sometimes it's obvious, like the fees, but other times, it’s less tangible.  Just like a great play requires strategy and dedication, so does achieving anything worthwhile.
