"As I watched the UFC fights in 2022, I was struck by the dedication of MMA athletes. Their rigorous training regimens and mental toughness are truly inspiring. I've always been fascinated by the world of combat sports, and I think that's why I'm drawn to the idea of creating content around it. Maybe that's why I'm excited about the emergence of new MMA YouTube channels - they bring the action and drama to a wider audience."
