## The Blazers' Reset and the What-Ifs of CJ McCollum

Okay, NBA fans, let's talk about Portland. It feels like just yesterday we were celebrating CJ McCollum’s incredible journey, his rise from undrafted to a legit star alongside Damian Lillard. But 2022 has brought a shift, a necessary reset for the Blazers. The whispers of a rebuild are loud, and that inevitably brings up the question: what happens with CJ?

I've been glued to Reddit threads, seeing everyone throw out potential destinations – the 76ers with their need for a scoring punch, the Knicks looking to shake things up, even the Pacers. It’s fascinating to consider. McCollum’s skillset – that crafty scoring, the sharp shooting – could genuinely elevate a contender.

But it also feels… bittersweet. Trading him feels like saying goodbye to a significant chapter of Blazers basketball. It’s a reminder that even in sports, things change, evolve, and sometimes, it hurts. Still, maybe this is the best path forward for everyone. What do you think?
