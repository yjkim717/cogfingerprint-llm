>## The Echo of a Past Victory (and Why It Still Matters)

It’s funny the things that stick with you, isn’t it? I was thinking about the 2011 World Series the other day – the Cardinals, the Rangers, that nail-biting Game 6… It feels like a lifetime ago, but I can still vividly remember the electric atmosphere, the collective gasp when Pujols hit that grand slam. 

We all have those sporting memories, those moments etched in time. They aren’t just about the win or loss; they're about who we were *then*, who we shared that experience with. Lately, with everything going on in 2022, it's been comforting to revisit those moments. It’s a reminder that even amidst uncertainty, there’s always something to look back on with joy, a victory to savor, a connection to cherish. And sometimes, that's enough.
