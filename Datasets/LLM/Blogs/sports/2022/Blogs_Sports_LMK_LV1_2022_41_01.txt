"March Madness is just around the corner, and the 2022 college basketball season is heating up. As I dug into the AP Poll rankings, I started to wonder: do voters really see the game the same way? I decided to analyze the data, sorting voters by their ranking similarities. What I found was fascinating - some voters were eerily consistent with their peers, while others were outliers, ranking teams in a way that diverged from the pack. The most consistent voters seemed to be influenced by a team's overall body of work, while the outliers were more likely to be swayed by recent performances. It's a reminder that, even in the world of data-driven sports analysis, there's still a healthy dose of subjectivity at play. As we head into the tournament, it's fun to consider whose votes will ultimately prevail - the steady hands or the wildcards?"
