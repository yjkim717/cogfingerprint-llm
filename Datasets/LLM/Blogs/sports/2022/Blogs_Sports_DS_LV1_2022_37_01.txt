It’s 2022, and I’m deep into an NCAA Football 14 online dynasty, chasing that nostalgic thrill. But my coordinators are stuck at Level 0—no matter how many XP points I earn, they won’t budge. I got desperate, tried a few instacommits from the recruiting board, and got slapped with penalties. It’s funny how a video game can mirror real coaching dilemmas: patience versus shortcuts, building a program versus chasing quick wins. Sometimes the game teaches you more about the grind than any playbook ever could.
