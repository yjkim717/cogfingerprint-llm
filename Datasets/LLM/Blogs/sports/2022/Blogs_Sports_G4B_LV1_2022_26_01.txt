**Lost in Translation? Not This Guy.**

Okay, so last night’s basketball game was intense, but honestly, I was more impressed with something else. I saw this young player, Liam, and he was *killing* it – both on the court and with his English! I caught a quick interview after the press conference, and he was so fluent and confident. It’s amazing to watch athletes push themselves beyond the game itself. Really made me think about the power of dedication and the joy of communication. #sports #bouncingback #languagelearning
