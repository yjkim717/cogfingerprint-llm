As I reflect on my 2022 soccer season, I'm reminded of the frustration I felt when our team's GPS tracker malfunctioned during a crucial match. It was like being a Doordash driver dealing with an app glitch - stuck, unsure of the next move. We improvised, using a manual workaround to keep the game on track. It was a lesson in adaptability, and one that I'll carry onto the field and beyond.
