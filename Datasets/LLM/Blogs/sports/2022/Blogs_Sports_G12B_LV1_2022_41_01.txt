>## The Beautiful, Messy Reality of Predicting College Football

Okay, let’s be honest, predicting college football is a fool’s errand. We all do it anyway, don't we? Every week, the AP Poll rolls around, and the internet explodes with opinions. But have you ever stopped to think about *who* is making those rankings, and how much they actually agree with each other?

I stumbled across a fascinating visualization the other day that mapped out the 2022 AP Poll ballots. It was wild! You could see clusters of voters with remarkably similar rankings, and then these lone wolves way out on the fringes. It really highlighted how subjective the whole process is. 

What struck me most was the consistency – or lack thereof. Some voters stuck to their guns week after week, while others were constantly reshuffling the deck. It made me appreciate the dedication of those who tried to maintain a consistent viewpoint, even when chaos reigned. 

Thinking back on that 2022 season, with all its upsets and Cinderella stories, it’s easy to see why rankings were so fluid. Trying to make sense of it all felt a bit like trying to herd cats. But that’s part of what makes college football so compelling, right? The unpredictability, the passion, and the sheer joy (and frustration!) of trying to figure it all out.
