The roar of the 2022 World Cup final is a distant echo now, the confetti long swept away. It’s funny; as a lifelong fan, I spent years chasing that electric, stadium-shaking high. But this year, my most memorable sporting moment happened in silence on a muddy Sunday morning. It was just me, a local park, and a kids’ football game. Watching those six-year-olds, tripping over the ball with pure, unfiltered joy, I finally understood. It wasn't about the global spectacle or the trophy. It was about the love of the game, a simple truth I’d lost somewhere in the fandom. Sometimes, you find the biggest victories in the smallest, quietest places.
