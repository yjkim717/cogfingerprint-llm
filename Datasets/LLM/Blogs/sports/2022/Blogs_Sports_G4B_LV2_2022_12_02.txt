**The Klay Thompson Question Mark**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 felt like a year of frantic fantasy basketball pivots. I was *all* in on Klay Thompson. He’d been a consistent, if slightly unspectacular, contributor for years, and ADP (Average Draft Position) was way too high for my taste. I was clinging to the “buy low” narrative, convinced he was about to bounce back. 

But then came the B2B rest – the constant late-game minutes he was getting with the Warriors. It just felt…off.  I started seeing the cracks, the worrying signs that maybe, just maybe, his prime was fading. 

It’s a weird feeling, isn't it?  Holding onto a player you *want* to believe in, even when the data suggests otherwise. It’s easy to get caught up in the hype, the past glories, and the hope for a resurgence.  But this season really hammered home the lesson: sometimes, the smartest move isn’t to chase the comeback story, but to recognize when a player’s trajectory is shifting.  Anyone else wrestle with that this year?
