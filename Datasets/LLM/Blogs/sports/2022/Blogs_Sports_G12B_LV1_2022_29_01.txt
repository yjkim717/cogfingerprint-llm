>## The Unexpected Throng at the Local Game

Okay, so I’ll admit, I was feeling pretty smug. October, right? Post-summer rush, I figured the local high school football game would be a nice, relaxed affair. A chance to soak in some small-town atmosphere, you know? Boy, was I wrong! 

Walking into the stadium last Friday night in 2022, I was met with a sea of faces – mostly families, packed shoulder to shoulder. It felt like a Friday night in August! Turns out, everyone's looking for a fun, accessible activity as the weather cools down. It was a vibrant, energetic scene, and while it wasn’t the quiet evening I anticipated, it was pretty awesome to be swept up in the community spirit.
