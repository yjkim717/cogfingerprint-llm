"Game Day Disappointment: A Lesson in Perseverance"

As I sat on the sidelines, watching my team struggle to get their Windows 10 USB drive to boot on their new Asus TUF laptop, I couldn't help but think of the countless times I'd faced similar frustration on the field. In 2022, we expect technology to work seamlessly, just like a well-executed play. But when the UEFI BIOS updates and multiple USB formatting attempts failed to yield results, my friend was on the verge of giving up. I encouraged them to keep trying, just as our coach would after a tough loss. We discovered that the NVMe SSD was the culprit, requiring a specific setting tweak. The win10 USB finally booted, and the installation was a slam dunk. It was a valuable lesson: sometimes, perseverance is the key to success, both on and off the field.
