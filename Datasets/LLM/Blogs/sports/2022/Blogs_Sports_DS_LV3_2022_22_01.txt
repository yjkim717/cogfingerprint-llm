That brutal flu in early 2022 sidelined me for a week. With zero appetite, I was in a major calorie deficit without trying. I lost a few pounds, sure, but my first run back was a harsh reality check. My body felt heavy, my metabolism clearly sluggish from the stress. It was a stark reminder that not all weight loss is created equal. Sometimes, the healthiest choice isn't pushing through, but truly resting and letting your body recover its strength.
