**The Weight of a Lost Season**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of almosts. My local rugby team – the Ravens – fought tooth and nail, but we just couldn’t quite break through. There were moments of pure brilliance, individual tackles that sent shivers down your spine, and a collective grit that was incredible to witness. But ultimately, we fell short.  It’s strange, the way you carry the weight of those near misses.  It’s not about dwelling, of course, but remembering the fight, the camaraderie… and knowing we’ll be back, ready to build that ‘built-in’ strength, just like optimizing a Rat King in Crucible.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or aiming for a specific length?
