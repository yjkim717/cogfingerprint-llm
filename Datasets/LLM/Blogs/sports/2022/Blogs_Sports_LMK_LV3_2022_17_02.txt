As I climbed the ranks on chess.com in 2022, I encountered a growing problem - trolls gloating over my losses. Despite my games being closely contested, some opponents couldn't resist taunting me. It was frustrating, but I learned to channel that emotion into improvement. I focused on analysis, not insults, and rose above the noise. My rating nearing 1000 was a testament to perseverance over petty provocations.
