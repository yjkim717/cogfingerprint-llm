Of all the places to have an existential crisis, I hadn’t predicted it would be at Mile 22 of the Berlin Marathon. The Brandenburg Gate was still a distant, mythical concept, and my legs had decided to hold a full-scale mutiny. Each footfall was a negotiation. The roaring crowd sounded like it was underwater. And in that hazy, pain-fueled silence, a single, bizarrely clear thought cut through: *I am 45 years old. What in the world am I doing here?*

It wasn’t a thought of surrender, but one of pure, unadulterated wonder. Because the man fighting for every stride in 2022 was a ghost of the 27-year-old who had laced up his first pair of real running shoes, utterly clueless, back in 2004.

That kid—let’s call him Mark 1.0—just wanted to lose a few pounds. He ran three miles, three times a week, and felt like an Olympian for doing it. A “long run” was six miles, after which he’d celebrate with a pizza, convinced he’d unlocked the secrets of the universe. He was, in running terms, an enthusiastic amateur. And he was blissfully unaware of the words “marathon training,” “mileage,” or “personal record.”

The transformation from Mark 1.0 to the weathered version currently trying to remember how to lift his knees wasn’t a sudden one. It was a slow, often imperceptible accretion. It was built not on talent, but on something far less sexy: durability.

People ask me, as a masters runner now, what the “secret” is. They expect me to talk about a magical workout, a specific diet, or a pair of shoes with springs in them. I always disappoint them. The secret is showing up. It’s the cumulative, unglamorous weight of thousands of mornings where the bed was warm and the pavement was cold. It’s the slow, patient build of running mileage, year after year, until your body doesn’t just tolerate the stress, but expects it.

My first marathon was a disaster. I trained on a flimsy 40-mile-a-week plan, hit the wall so hard at Mile 18 I’m surprised there wasn’t a crater, and hobbled across the line in a time I now wouldn’t consider for a training run. But it lit a fuse. I was no longer running *to finish*. I was running to see what I was made of.

The journey to a 2:37 marathon, which I finally nailed in my late thirties, wasn’t a straight line. It was a graph with more peaks and valleys than the Boston Marathon course. It was forged in the crucible of high-mileage training. We’re talking weeks of 100, 110, even 120 miles. This isn’t a prescription; it’s my story. For me, volume was the key. It taught my body to be efficient, to burn fat as fuel, to recycle lactate, and most importantly, to be resilient.

But here’s the thing about advanced running that nobody tells you: the physical part is only half the battle. The other half is entirely in your head. At a certain point, you’re not running with your legs; you’re running with your mind.
