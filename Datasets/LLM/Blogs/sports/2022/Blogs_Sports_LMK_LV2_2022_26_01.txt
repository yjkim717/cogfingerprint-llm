"Luka Doncic's post-game interview with the Thunder was a breath of fresh air in 2022. What struck me wasn't just his impressive skills on the court, but his remarkable English fluency and raw intelligence. It's a testament to his dedication to player development, both on and off the court. As I watched him articulately share his thoughts, I was reminded that growth is a continuous process - a valuable lesson for athletes and non-athletes alike."
