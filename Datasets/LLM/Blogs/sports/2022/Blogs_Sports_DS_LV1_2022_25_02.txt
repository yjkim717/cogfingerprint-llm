It’s funny how sports and movies overlap in my mind. Watching old clips of Floyd Landis, I couldn’t shake the feeling he was Matt Damon’s long-lost cycling twin. Then I remembered Skip Grigaris from *Major League*—a dead ringer for Paul Rudd. In 2022, with so much focus on analytics and stats, these quirky doppelgängers remind me that sports, at its heart, is still about the people and the stories we attach to them, real or fictional.
