The Agony of a Botched Call: A Reflection on Moderation in Sports

As I sat in front of the TV watching the 2022 World Cup, I couldn't help but feel a sense of déjà vu. The referees were making calls that left me and millions of others scratching our heads. But it wasn't just the referees' decisions that got my blood boiling – it was the realization that moderation is a tricky business, whether it's on the field or online.

I started thinking about the recent controversy on Reddit, where an admin stickied a spam post on a subreddit, effectively removing another sticky post. The community was up in arms, and rightfully so. It was a mess. But as I reflected on the incident, I realized that it's not that different from a disputed call in sports.

In both cases, the moderators (or referees) have a tough job. They're making split-second decisions that can have a significant impact on the outcome. And sometimes, they get it wrong. The difference is that, in sports, we expect our referees to be impartial and fair. Online, we're still figuring out what moderation looks like.

As I watched the World Cup continue, I couldn't help but think that there's a lesson to be learned from the beautiful game. Moderation is not just about enforcing rules – it's about creating a fair and enjoyable experience for everyone involved. Whether it's on the field or online, we need to be willing to adapt and learn from our mistakes.
