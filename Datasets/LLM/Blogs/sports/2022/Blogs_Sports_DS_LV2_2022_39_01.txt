Of course, here is a reflective blog post about sports in 2022.

### The Unseen Work

I was cleaning out my phone's camera roll the other day and stumbled upon a video from last January—just a shaky clip of me on a treadmill, gasping for air after a pathetic two-minute run. My New Year's resolution to "get fit" felt like a cruel joke back then.

Fast forward to now. I just signed up for my first 5k. I’m not trying to win it; I just want to finish. Looking at that old video, I realized something profound about sports and fitness. The real victory in 2022 wasn't found on a podium. It was in the quiet, consistent grind that nobody else saw. It was in choosing the run over the couch, week after week.

The progress was invisible for so long, like a seed growing underground. But now, I can finally see the shoot breaking through the surface. It was always there, working, even when I couldn't see it.
