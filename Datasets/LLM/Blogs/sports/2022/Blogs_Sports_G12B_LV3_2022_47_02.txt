## The Unexpected Lesson from a Losing Season

Remember that feeling when your team just… wasn’t it? 2022 felt like that for a lot of us, didn't it? My local baseball team, the River Hawks, had a rough one. Honestly, I almost stopped watching. But something shifted. I realized the joy wasn't solely tied to wins and championships. It was in the shared experience, the camaraderie with friends at the games, and even appreciating the grit of players battling through adversity. Losing taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, the journey, even when it's tough, is just as important as the destination. And that’s a lesson that applies way beyond the baseball diamond.
