The heart wants what it wants, and mine was set on a beautiful backyard pavilion with a soaring roof. I pictured rich, warm **red cedar** **rafters** overhead, a natural ceiling that would make the space feel like a true extension of our home. I spent hours sketching the design, from the **ledger board** attached to the house to the elegant **standing seam** metal roof I planned for the top.

Then came the reality check: the **lumber cost**. Getting a quote for the red cedar was a gut punch. It was astronomically more expensive than pressure-treated pine or even Douglas fir. Suddenly, my dream material felt like an indulgence. Was the aesthetic benefit worth doubling the budget for the entire structure? I’m now deep in research, trying to find a compromise. Maybe I can use cedar for just the visible, interior-facing rafters and a cheaper alternative for the hidden structural members. It’s a classic battle between the ideal vision and the practical reality of the wallet.

And here is a reflective blog post about sports, set in 2022.

I’ll admit, I was skeptical when my buddy dragged me to a pickleball court in the spring of 2022. “It’s just ping-pong on a tennis court,” I scoffed. But as the pandemic fog slowly lifted, we were all searching for new ways to connect.

That first swing was clumsy, but the laughter was instant. There was something beautifully simple about the *thwock* of the ball and the short, frantic rallies. It wasn’t about power or perfect technique; it was about movement and conversation. We found ourselves on those painted concrete courts every weekend, a rotating crew of neighbors and friends.

Looking back, pickleball was more than a 2022 fad for us. It was the perfect re-entry sport—low pressure, highly social, and a reminder that sometimes the most meaningful victories aren't about winning, but just about showing up and playing. My old tennis racket gathers dust now, and I’m perfectly okay with that.
