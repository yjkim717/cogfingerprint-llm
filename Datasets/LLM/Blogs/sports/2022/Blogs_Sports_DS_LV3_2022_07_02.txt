The court felt different this season. With the new "Rat King" offense everyone was running, I knew I had to adapt—like shedding old skin, becoming one of the ophidians gliding through defenses. My coach kept preaching about the "TTD build": teamwork, tempo, and discipline. But no matter how many hours I put in, my agility felt stuck at 41. The playbook said to aim for 100, to move like air itself, but my old armor just couldn’t keep up. I tried every mod, every drill, chasing that elusive flow state where every move is instinct. It’s 2022, and the game’s evolving faster than I am. Some days, you realize the biggest opponent isn’t across the net—it’s the ceiling you haven’t broken yet.
