**The Face of a Champion (and a Doppelganger?)**

Okay, so I was scrolling through some old cycling news from 2007 – Lance Armstrong’s heyday – and it struck me how often we see uncanny resemblances in people. Like, seriously. Paul Rudd just *looks* like Skip Grigaris, his old *Scrubs* co-star, doesn’t he? It’s a weird, almost unsettling thing. 

I started thinking about Floyd Landis, too. There’s a fleeting face-to-face resemblance with Matt Damon! It’s a reminder that sometimes, appearances aren't everything, but it’s still a fun little quirk of the human face – and a fascinating glimpse into how we perceive identity. 2022 and still noticing these things!

Do you want me to tweak this or explore a different angle?
