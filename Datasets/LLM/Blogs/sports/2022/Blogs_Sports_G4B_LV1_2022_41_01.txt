**The AP Poll Puzzle: Did Anyone *Really* Know Where We Were Going?**

Remember the frantic energy of the 2022 college football season? Every week, the AP Poll dropped, and suddenly, everyone was an expert. But let’s be honest, was there any *real* consistency? I spent a ridiculous amount of time staring at those rankings, and it struck me how many voters seemed to be chasing the same narrative, while others… well, they were delightfully off-base. 

It’s fascinating to see those “consistent” voters – the ones who stubbornly clung to a top-ten – and then those wildcards who predicted upsets nobody saw coming. Did they have a secret? Or were they just reacting to the hype?  The AP Poll is supposed to be a reflection of the season, but sometimes it felt more like a prediction market, fueled by opinions and, let's face it, a little bit of guesswork.
