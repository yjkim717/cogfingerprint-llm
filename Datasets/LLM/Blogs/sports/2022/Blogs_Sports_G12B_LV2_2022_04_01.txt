## The Silent Stadium and the Unexpected Lesson

Remember that Yankees playoff game last October? The energy was electric, everyone on the edge of their seats. Then, a crucial strikeout. The stadium justâ€¦ *stopped*. A collective exhale, a stunned silence. It was weird, almost unsettling. But it also reminded me how quickly momentum shifts, how easily expectations deflate. Sports, like life, throws curveballs. Sometimes, you just have to sit with the quiet and brace for the next pitch.
