It’s 2022, and the NBA rumor mill is buzzing again—this time about Kevin Durant. I get it; he’s a generational talent, the kind of player who can single-handedly shift the balance of power. But as I think about what it would take to trade for him, I can’t help but feel a little uneasy.

Imagine your team giving up multiple first-round picks and promising young players—the very foundation of a sustainable contender—for a superstar who, let’s be honest, has faced his share of injuries. Would Durant bring you closer to a championship? Possibly. But at what cost? You’d be betting everything on an aging star, risking your team’s future in one high-stakes move.

Sometimes, the flashiest path isn’t the wisest. Building something lasting takes patience, not just blockbuster trades.
