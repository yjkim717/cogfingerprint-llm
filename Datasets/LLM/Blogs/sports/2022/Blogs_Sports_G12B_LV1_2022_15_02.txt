## The Unexpected Curveball of '22

Honestly, 2022 felt like a season of unexpected plays. Not just in the World Series – though watching the Phillies come so close was wild! – but in life generally. I went into the year with a plan, a neat little strategy. Then, *bam*, a curveball. Like a scrappy, mixed-breed dog you wouldn’t expect to win a race, I found myself adapting, learning, and ultimately, finding joy in the beautiful chaos. It wasn't what I envisioned, but it was pretty good.
