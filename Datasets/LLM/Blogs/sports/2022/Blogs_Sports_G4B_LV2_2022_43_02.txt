**The Shot I Still Can’t Seem to Make**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single moment can stick with you, long after the game’s over. Last fall, I was absolutely *hammering* at this basketball league – feeling confident, even good. Then came the regional finals. Down by one, with maybe five seconds left, I drove to the basket, went up for *the* shot. 

It felt right. Perfect arc, clean release… and clanked off the rim. 

I’ve replayed it a million times since. Not out of frustration, really, but out of this weird, persistent feeling that I could have done *something* differently. It’s like that Maliketh boss fight in Elden Ring – relentlessly trying different approaches, stubbornly refusing help, and still failing. 

Sometimes, the biggest win isn’t the final score, but the quiet acceptance of a missed shot and the determination to keep practicing.  Anyone else have a shot they just can’t quite shake?
