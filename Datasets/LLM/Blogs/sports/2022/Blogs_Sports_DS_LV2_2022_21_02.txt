There’s something special about the hum of anticipation before a college football season kicks off. I remember scrolling through the r/CFB poll announcement back in 2022, seeing familiar names chosen as main voters and feeling that familiar mix of excitement and envy. But this time was different—the introduction of provisional voting meant everyone in our community got a voice. It felt like the gates had opened just a little wider, inviting more of us to share in the ritual of ranking, debating, and dreaming together.

It’s more than just clicks and comments; it’s about belonging. Whether you’re a main voter or testing the waters provisionally, you’re part of the story. And isn’t that what college football is all about?
