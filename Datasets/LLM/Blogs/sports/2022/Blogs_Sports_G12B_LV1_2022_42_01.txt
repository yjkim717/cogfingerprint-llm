## Is It Time to Shake Up the Timberwolves Rotation?

Okay, Timberwolves fans, let's be real. We're all watching, hoping for a playoff push, and sometimes… it feels like we're watching the same frustrating patterns repeat. I’ve been particularly noticing Jaylen Nowell. Seriously, the guy’s been flashing some serious potential when he gets those minutes. 

I mean, have you seen his scoring bursts off the bench? He injects a much-needed energy and offensive spark. It got me thinking – are we maybe clinging too tightly to established roles? What if Coach Finch experimented a bit more? 

Look, nobody wants to see anyone benched, but if a player like Nowell is consistently outperforming a starter, shouldn’t that factor into the playing time equation? It’s a tough call, especially with Ant Edwards carrying such a heavy load. But maybe, just maybe, a little shake-up in the rotation, prioritizing performance over reputation, could be exactly what this team needs to find that extra gear heading into 2023. Thoughts? Let’s hear ‘em!
