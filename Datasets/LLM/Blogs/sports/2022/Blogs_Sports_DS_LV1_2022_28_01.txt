### The Cardboard Debate: What *Really* Defines a Rookie?

I was sorting through a box of old baseball cards the other day, the smell of stale bubble gum and cardboard taking me right back. My fingers stopped on a 1997 Scott Rolen card, the one that proudly declares him the NL Rookie of the Year. It’s a beautiful card, capturing a player at the peak of his initial success.

But it got me thinking—is this his *true* rookie?

The hobby purists will tell you it’s all about the first-year cards, the ones from his 1996 debut in Topps and Bowman. Those are the prospect cards, the “first appearance” that collectors covet. Yet, here in my hand was the card that celebrated the achievement, the proof that the prospect had officially arrived.

In 2022, with the hobby booming again, this debate feels more relevant than ever. Is the true rookie the first chapter of the story, or the moment the promise was fulfilled? For me, the 1997 card will always hold a special magic. It’s not just a piece of cardboard; it’s the tangible evidence of a dream realized. The debate will rage on, but sometimes, the story is more important than the rulebook.
