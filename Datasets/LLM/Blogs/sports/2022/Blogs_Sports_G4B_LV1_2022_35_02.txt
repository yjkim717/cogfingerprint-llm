**Forty and Feeling Fantastic: My Unexpected Marathon Journey**

Let’s be honest, the idea of running a marathon used to conjure up images of spandex-clad youngsters and a level of athleticism I definitely didn’t possess. I was 42, comfortable on the sofa, and my idea of a “good workout” involved a brisk walk around the block. But last year, something shifted. I started thinking, “Why not?” – a slightly terrifying, wonderfully liberating thought. 

It wasn’t a sudden obsession, more like a quiet nudge. I’d been reading about “couch to marathon” programs, intrigued by the sheer audacity of transforming from zero to 26.2 miles. I started small, of course. Just a mile, then two, then building up gradually.  There were days, let me tell you, where my legs felt like lead, and the couch looked *really* appealing. But I stuck with it, fueled by a surprising amount of intermittent fasting – a little experimentation that seemed to give my body a much-needed boost. 

2022 became all about mileage.  Slowly, steadily, my weekly distance crept up. It wasn't always pretty, and there were definitely some frustrating plateaus.  I was laser-focused on consistency, knowing that the little gains added up over time.  I even started tracking my progress, obsessing a little over those incremental improvements – each mile conquered felt like a small victory. 

And then, the race day arrived. It was exhilarating, exhausting, and utterly transformative. I managed to shave nearly five minutes off my previous best time – a personal record I still can’t quite believe!  More than the time, though, it was the feeling of accomplishment, of proving to myself that age is just a number. 

This marathon wasn’t about speed; it was about perseverance and rediscovering a passion I never knew I had. If you’re feeling that little spark of “what if?”, I say go for it. You might just surprise yourself.
