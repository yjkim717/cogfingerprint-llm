**Leveling Up My Fan Game (and My Amex!)**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of small, strategic upgrades – and my American Express card was definitely one of them. I’d been hoarding points for ages, and finally adding a supplementary user to my card felt like a real game-changer. Suddenly, airline incidentals weren’t just a pipe dream; they were a tangible benefit. 

It made me think about my own fandom too – bringing a friend to a game elevates the experience for both of us.  Sometimes, it's about sharing the joy, and a little strategic planning (like that Amex!) can really make it happen.  FHR – or “Fan Homebase Rewards,” as I’m now calling it – is officially my new favorite thing.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post on a different topic?
