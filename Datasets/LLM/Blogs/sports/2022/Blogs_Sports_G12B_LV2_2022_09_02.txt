>## The Unexpected Lesson from a Losing Season

Okay, 2022 was…rough for my local baseball team, the River City Rapids. I’ve been a season ticket holder for years, through thick and thin, and this year felt particularly thin. Honestly, there were days I almost gave up. Why bother showing up to watch a team consistently struggle? 

But something kept pulling me back. Maybe it was the shared disappointment with the other fans, a strange sense of camaraderie in the collective groan. Or maybe it was realizing that even in losing, there were moments of grit, flashes of potential, and the simple joy of a sunny afternoon at the ballpark. 

It was a good reminder that sometimes, the journey, even a losing one, can teach you more than a victory ever could. And hey, there's always next year, right?
