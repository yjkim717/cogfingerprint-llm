## That Weekend League Wall (and How I Finally Cracked It)

Anyone else feel like FIFA 22's Weekend League was just… relentless? I swear, every other game was a constant, suffocating press. My usual tactics were getting shredded, and I was seriously close to chucking the controller. It felt like *everyone* was playing the same ultra-aggressive build-up, constantly swarming the midfield. 

I spent a good chunk of October and November just getting frustrated, stubbornly sticking to what I knew. Then, after a particularly brutal losing streak, I decided to actually *listen* to the advice bouncing around online. Wider formations, hugging the sidelines… even tweaking my camera angle felt weird at first. 

But you know what? It worked. Slowly, I started seeing space, creating chances, and actually enjoying the game again. It was a good reminder, I think, that sometimes the best way to win isn't to force your way, but to adapt and find a new angle. It's a lesson that applies way beyond the virtual pitch, right? What strategies have *you* had to rethink lately?
