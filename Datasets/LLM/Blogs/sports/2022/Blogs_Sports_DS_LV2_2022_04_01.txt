That final buzzer in 2022 still echoes. We didn't win the championship, but the real victory was in the eighth-grade tryouts I almost skipped. Heart pounding, I stepped onto the court. It wasn't about trophies; it was about conquering that whisper of doubt. Sometimes the biggest win is simply showing up, proving to yourself that you belong in the game.
