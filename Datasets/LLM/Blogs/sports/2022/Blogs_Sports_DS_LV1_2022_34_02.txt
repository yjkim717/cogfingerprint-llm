As we look ahead to the 2022 college football season, it’s hard not to feel a mix of excitement and nostalgia. I remember watching Bryce Young and Will Anderson Jr. dominate last year—their talent felt almost unreal. Now, seeing them headline ESPN’s way-too-early All-America team, it’s a reminder of how fleeting these moments are. Georgia’s Bulldogs, fresh off their championship high, are proof that greatness is earned, not given. These players aren’t just names on a list; they’re stories in the making. It’s why I love this sport—every season writes a new chapter, and we’re lucky enough to watch it unfold together.
