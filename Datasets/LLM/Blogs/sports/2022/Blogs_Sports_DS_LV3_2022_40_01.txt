There’s something almost magical about that moment when a golf ball decides to drop. I’d been standing over a 9-foot putt on a par-3 that had given me nothing but grief all season. The wind was up, the green was slick, and my heart was thumping like a drum solo. In 2022, with the world feeling so chaotic, these four hours on the course had become my sanctuary, my place to wrestle with something I could actually control: my own swing.

I took a breath, kept my head down, and made the stroke. The ball tracked, curling ever so slightly, and then—that beautiful, soft rattle at the bottom of the cup. A birdie. Only my second one ever.

The celebration was a quiet, fist-pumping affair, just me and the vast, forgiving sky. It wasn't about beating anyone else; it was a small, personal victory. A reminder that persistence, even in the face of a notoriously difficult game, pays off in moments of pure, unadulterated joy.
