**The Unreturned Pass: When a Game Feels Like Dating**

You know that feeling? You’re playing a really good game, things are clicking, you’ve connected with a teammate – it’s like that perfect first pass, right? Then… nothing. They don’t respond. You throw another one, and another, but it’s just a silent exchange. 

That’s exactly how I felt after last weekend’s league game. I had a really solid performance, felt a great connection with my center, and we were building some amazing plays. Afterwards, I sent her a quick text – just a simple “Great game, hope you had fun!” – but it was left on read. 

It’s the same anxiety as a first date, isn’t it? You’re analyzing every move, wondering if you said the right thing, if you’re “worthy” of a follow-up.  Do I keep throwing passes, hoping for a connection? Or do I move on to a new play? 

Honestly, it’s frustrating.  You want to know where you stand.  Maybe I’m overthinking it, maybe she's just busy. But that little ‘left on read’ felt a lot like a missed opportunity, and a reminder that even in sports, sometimes the best plays are the ones that get noticed.
