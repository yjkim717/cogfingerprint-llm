**The Rookie Glow: Peña vs. Tulowitzki – A 2022 Reflection**

It’s weird how quickly a season can rewrite the narrative, isn’t it? Watching Jeremy Peña this year felt like a throwback – a legitimate, dominant rookie. Suddenly, I was flipping through old stats, comparing him to Troy Tulowitzki’s incredible 2009. Both brought a spark, but Peña’s blend of power (22 home runs!) and that incredible DRR/OAA defense felt… different. It reminded me that flashes of brilliance, even in a stacked league, still stand out.  What a year for Peña!
