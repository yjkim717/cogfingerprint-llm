## The Unexpected Drift and a Lesson in Grit

Remember that blizzard we had back in January 2022? It was brutal. I was determined to finally conquer my driveway with my new, top-of-the-line snowblower – a JD 332, I felt like a pro. Except… it was a disaster. It kept stalling, clogging up with the heavy, wet snow. Honestly, it felt like it lacked any real power against the storm. 

It made me think about the Celtics' season. They started so strong, looked unstoppable. Then, mid-season, they hit a wall. A frustrating clog of injuries and inconsistent play. It was tough to watch, a bit like wrestling with a machine that just wouldn't cooperate. 

Eventually, I figured out the snowblower's issues (wrong fuel mix!), and the Celtics, well, they battled. It taught me a lesson: even the best equipment, or the most talented teams, need constant adjustments and a whole lot of grit to overcome a serious challenge.
