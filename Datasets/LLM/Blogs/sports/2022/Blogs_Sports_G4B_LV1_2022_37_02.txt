**The Year I Became Obsessed with Petty Football Feuds**

Honestly, 2022 was…weird. I started getting ridiculously worked up about college football, and it wasn't even about the games themselves. It started with Kansas State – I just had a general dislike for them, I don’t know why! Then, a friend doubled down on my negativity, fueled by some Dylan Thompson play. 

It felt so stupid, obsessing over a car blocking penalty or a missed field goal. It was a petty reason to be angry, and I realized I was letting it consume me. Looking back, it’s a reminder to enjoy the sport for what it is, not for manufactured rivalries.
