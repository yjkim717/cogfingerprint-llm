The final buzzer of my last high school basketball game in 2022 hit me harder than any opponent ever did. Sitting on the bench, the roar of the crowd fading, it wasn't the loss that stung—it was the silence afterward. For years, my identity was tied to that court, those plays, that team. Letting go felt like forgetting a part of myself. It’s a strange grief, mourning not just a game, but a chapter of your life you can never quite get back.
