As a hockey fan in 2022, I’ve learned that faceoffs aren’t just about the center’s initial win—it’s the gritty battle for possession that truly counts. Sometimes the puck doesn’t go where you aim, but the player who seizes control earns that statistic. It’s a lot like life: intention matters less than what you do with the outcome.
