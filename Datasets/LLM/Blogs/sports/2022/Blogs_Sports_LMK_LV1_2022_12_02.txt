As we navigated the 2022 fantasy basketball season, one name kept popping up in my Yahoo league chats: Klay Thompson. After a slow start, Thompson's value took a hit, and owners were left wondering if he was worth holding onto. For those employing a punt strategy, Thompson's ADP (average draft position) made him an attractive pick, but his lackluster beginnings raised concerns. However, as we all know, Thompson has a history of turning it around. I recall drafting him in one of my leagues, and despite his initial struggles, I saw an opportunity to buy low on a player with a proven track record. As the season progressed, Thompson began to heat up, and his production started to justify the risk. For fantasy basketball enthusiasts, Thompson's resurgence serves as a reminder to keep a close eye on players experiencing a slump â€“ they might just be worth a flier.
