## The Crushes That Shaped My Bracket (and Maybe Yours)

Remember those early basketball obsessions? For me, it wasn't just about the game – it was about *who* was playing. Back in the late 90s, it was Grant Hill. The smooth jumper, the athleticism, the whole package. Looking back, it’s undeniably tied to being a kid navigating puberty, wanting to emulate someone cool and capable. 

It’s a weird thing, these formative celebrity crushes, isn’t it? They become these little time capsules, linked to specific memories and feelings. I was reading a Reddit thread the other day about it, and it got me thinking – what were *your* basketball crushes? And how did those preferences shape your fandom? I bet even Bill Simmons has a few nostalgic picks he wouldn't readily admit. Makes you wonder what influences our sports allegiances more than we realize.
