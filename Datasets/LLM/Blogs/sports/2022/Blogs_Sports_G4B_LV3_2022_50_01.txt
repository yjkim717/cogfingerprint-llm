I was at a Novak Djokovic match last year – Wimbledon, 2022 – and something unexpected happened. During a break, I noticed him meticulously cleaning his guitar pick, a simple, worn-out piece of plastic. It was a tiny, almost invisible moment, but it felt profoundly human. Seeing a legend, so focused on such a small detail, reminded me that even the most celebrated athletes are, at their core, just people. It was a quiet connection, a shared vulnerability, and honestly, pretty incredible.
