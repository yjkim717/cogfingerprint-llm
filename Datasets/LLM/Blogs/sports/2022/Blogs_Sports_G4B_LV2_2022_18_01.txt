**The Unexpected Shift in My Game**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How sometimes the biggest breakthroughs aren't about drastically changing your technique, but about shifting your *perspective*. This year, 2022, I’ve been really focused on my tennis – trying to shave off milliseconds, perfect my serve, you know the drill. I was getting frustrated. Stats weren’t moving as quickly as I wanted, and I felt like I was just going through the motions.

Then, during a particularly tough match, something clicked. I started really paying attention to how my opponent *moved* – their rhythm, their positioning, their relative strength on the court. It wasn't about beating them at *their* game, but understanding *my* game in relation to theirs. 

It sounds simple, right? Like a trading strategy – noticing the "relative strength" of a certain approach. But suddenly, I was reacting more instinctively, anticipating their shots, and finding angles I hadn’t seen before. 

It’s funny. Just like that trader with the SPY and flag patterns, I realized I’d been so fixated on the *outcome* that I’d lost sight of the process.  This year has been about recognizing that true improvement comes from observing, adapting, and understanding how everything connects.  Maybe that’s a lesson we can all apply, whether we’re on a tennis court or in the market.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps explore a different angle?
