## The Long Game: Finding My Speed (and Staying in One Piece) After High School

It's funny, isn't it? How something you loved so fiercely as a teenager can feel… different, later on. For me, that something is running. I remember the sting of chlorine and the echoing thud of sneakers on the track during high school cross country. I wasn't a star. Not even close. Solidly mid-pack, a reliable contributor, but never the one crossing the finish line first. I put in the work, I showed up, but “exceptional” wasn’t really in my vocabulary.  I just… ran.

Looking back at those years in 2022, it feels like a different lifetime. We were so focused on the next meet, the next PR, the next step on the podium. There was a certain intensity, a pressure – both self-imposed and external – to constantly be *better*.  And, honestly, a lot of it was fuelled by a desire to escape the awkwardness of being a teenager. Running gave me a structure, a purpose, and a place where I felt I could push myself, even if the results weren't always spectacular.

Then college happened. Life happened. Running took a serious backseat. Years drifted by filled with late-night study sessions, new friendships, career explorations, and the general chaos of figuring out adulthood. The running shoes gathered dust in the closet. The familiar ache in my legs faded, replaced by the stiffness of a desk job and the occasional twinge from bad posture.

I always *knew* I'd go back. That little voice in the back of my head kept whispering about the rhythm of my feet on pavement, the feeling of pushing through discomfort, the simple joy of being outside. But actually restarting? That felt daunting.  The idea of lacing up again, facing that inevitable comparison to my younger self, felt… heavy.

It was 2019 when I finally took the plunge. A casual 5k. I was *slow*. Painfully slow. My lungs burned, my legs screamed, and I finished feeling like I’d run a marathon (which, in my current state, wouldn't have been entirely inaccurate!). The old competitive fire flickered, but it was quickly doused by a wave of self-doubt. Was I kidding myself? Was I just chasing a ghost of my past?

But something kept me going. Maybe it was a stubborn refusal to let my younger self down. Maybe it was the quiet satisfaction of simply *doing* something challenging. Or maybe, it was just the undeniable feeling of being alive and connected to my body.

The biggest lesson I’ve learned in these past few years, especially as I’ve entered the “masters” category (and, let’s be honest, it snuck up on me!), is that it’s not about replicating those high school times. It’s about the *long game*.  It’s about understanding that my body is different now. My priorities are different
