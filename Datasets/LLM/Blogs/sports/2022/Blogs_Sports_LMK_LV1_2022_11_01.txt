"My Sports Hall of Fame: A Personal Mount Rushmore"
As I reflect on my sports fandom in 2022, I realize my childhood crushes on athletes have stood the test of time. Just like a Mount Rushmore of celebrities, I've curated a lineup of favorite athletes. For me, it's Simone Biles (gymnastics), Tom Brady (football), Serena Williams (tennis), and Stephen Curry (basketball). Who are the athletes that make up your Mount Rushmore? Share with me your all-time favorite sports heroes and let's relive the excitement of watching them dominate their respective sports!
