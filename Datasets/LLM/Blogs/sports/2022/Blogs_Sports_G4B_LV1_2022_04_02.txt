**Blog Post – The Unexpected Echo**

It’s weird, right? You’re chasing a good feeling, pushing yourself during a workout, and then… a persistent ringing. I’ve been dealing with a low-level tinnitus lately, and it really threw me for a loop. I started taking Tylenol for a nasty headache – something I rarely do – and within a couple of days, the ringing got noticeably worse. It’s a stark reminder that even over-the-counter meds can have unexpected side effects, and to listen to your body.



**Reflective Sports Blog Post – 2022**

The rain in Seattle that October felt relentless. We were down by a point with seconds left in the game, and I knew I had to take the shot. Honestly, my heart was pounding so hard I thought I’d burst. I’d practiced that exact moment a thousand times, but in that pressure, everything felt… different. It wasn't about the skill; it was about trusting my instincts and just letting go. That miss taught me more about resilience than any win ever could. 2022 was a year of tough lessons, and sometimes, the biggest gains come from the falls.
