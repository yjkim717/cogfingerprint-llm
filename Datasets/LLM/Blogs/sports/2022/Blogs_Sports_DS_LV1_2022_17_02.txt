It’s 2022, and I’m grinding 5-minute games on Chess.com, trying to climb from the lower levels. Last night, I lost a nail-biter—just one rushed move. Immediately, a message pops up: “LOL, lucky noob.” Really? We both blundered all game. It’s funny how a tiny rating number makes people forget we’re here to learn and grow. Win or lose, respect should be the real victory.
