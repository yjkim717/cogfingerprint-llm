It’s funny how a piece of cardboard can hold so much memory. I was digging through an old box in my garage the other day—2022 had me in a nostalgic mood—and I stumbled across my Scott Rolen cards from the mid-90s. Instantly, I was 12 again, debating with my friends in the schoolyard about which one was his *real* rookie card. Was it the 1995 Bowman prospect, full of future promise? Or the 1996 Topps, capturing that electric MLB debut?

Back then, it felt like we were deciding his legacy before it even unfolded. Now, with Rolen’s Hall of Fame induction on the horizon, those debates feel even more poignant. We weren’t just collecting; we were connecting—to the game, to each other, and to the stories waiting to be told. Funny, isn’t it? Sometimes, the real value isn’t in the card’s rarity, but in the moments it brings rushing back.
