**The Day the Cyclone Fans Had to Wait**

Okay, Cyclone Nation, let’s be honest – 2022 was *weird* for football. I was practically vibrating with excitement for the El Assico game against KU, picturing a sea of orange and black in Iowa City. Then, the news dropped: the marching band was heading to Lawrence. Seriously? 

Apparently, past clashes with the KU band had led to some pretty tense situations, and ISU decided to prioritize the safety of their musicians. It felt…disappointing, I’m not gonna lie.  Seeing those familiar faces – the Hawkeyes – packed into Memorial Stadium was definitely a bummer. But you know what?  It just made the victory that much sweeter.  Sometimes, a little strategic maneuvering is all it takes to keep the Cyclone spirit alive, right? #CycloneNation #ElAssico #ISUFootball

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post focused on a different angle related to the original summary?
