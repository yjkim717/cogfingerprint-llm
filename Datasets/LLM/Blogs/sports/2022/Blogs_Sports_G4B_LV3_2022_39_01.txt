**The Unexpected Layers of a Game**

You know how sometimes, after a really intense game, you feel like you’ve just… layered yourself? Like there’s this whole other level of experience you didn’t even realize was there? That's how I felt after the regional finals this year. We lost, a tough, heartbreaking loss. 

But as I was cleaning up the equipment – the balls, the cones, the sweaty jerseys – I started to notice the subtle things. The way the mycelium – that’s my analogy for the team’s collective effort – had really concentrated at the bottom after all the scrambling and pushing.  

It made me think about how we’d stored our energy, our focus, throughout the season. Sometimes it’s all surface-level hustle, visible plays. But the real strength, the *viability* of our team, was in those quiet moments of support, those unexpected surges of resilience. 

Just like a mushroom grower observing liquid cultures, I realized we needed to keep a close eye on those foundational layers, those less obvious signs, to ensure we were truly ready for the next challenge.  It’s a reminder that success isn’t always about the flashy moments; it's about the consistent, underlying strength.
