### The 5 AM Pact I Made With Myself

It’s 2022, and let’s be honest, the world feels a little heavier. For me, the answer wasn't in the newsfeed, but in the pre-dawn quiet of my kitchen. That’s where my morning pact begins.

The blender’s roar is my alarm clock. I chug down my green smoothie—spinach, banana, a scoop of protein—not for taste, but for fuel. It’s the promise I make to my body before I ask anything of it. By the time I’m lacing up my shoes, that familiar buzz starts to hum, a signal that I’m transitioning from a sleepy human into someone ready to fight for the day.

The gym at that hour is a special kind of sanctuary. It’s just me, the clank of weights, and the shared, unspoken determination with the other early risers. Every drop of sweat feels like I’m literally squeezing out the previous day’s stress.

But the real magic? It happens after. The cool down, the slow sip of water, that first conscious breath where my body hums with a gentle fatigue. The recovery isn’t just physical; it’s a mental reset. I walk out those doors feeling clear, capable, and quietly powerful, ready to face whatever the year throws at me. That hour I give to myself? It gives me the whole day in return.
