**Remembering Those Cardinals Sweeps**

2022… man, what a year for baseball. I still get a little buzz thinking about how dominant the Cardinals were. Seriously, watching them sweep the Yankees felt almost surreal. It wasn't just wins; it was the *way* they won – a complete, relentless pressure. The Orioles and Blue Jays fell similarly. It was a reminder that sometimes, a team just gets locked in. Those sweeps felt like a statement, a sign that the Cardinals were truly a force to be reckoned with in the AL East. A fantastic season to witness!
