**The Shot I Still Replay**

It’s funny how certain moments stick with you, right? 2022 was a weird year for my high school basketball team – we peaked early, then sputtered. I remember one game, down by five with seconds left. The ball was in my hands, a contested three. I drove, faked, shot… and missed. 

The silence afterward was deafening. But you know what? Even now, years later, I replay that shot. Not because it was good, but because it felt *real*. It was a moment of pressure, of hope, and of letting go.  Sometimes, the biggest lessons aren’t in the wins, but in the shots we bravely take, regardless of the outcome.
