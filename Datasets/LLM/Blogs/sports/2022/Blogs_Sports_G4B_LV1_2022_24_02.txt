**USB Boot Blues: When Your PC Just Won’t Cooperate**

Okay, let’s be honest – troubleshooting computer issues can feel like wrestling an octopus. I recently hit a frustrating snag with my 2019 Asus Tuf Book. It’s *recognizing* my USB drives, and the UEFI/BIOS is happily showing me the drive is detected, but I just can’t get it to boot from a USB! 

I’ve tried everything I could think of – multiple Win10 and Ubuntu USBs, even considered reinstalling. It’s baffling.  I’m starting to suspect a deeper BIOS setting issue, or perhaps a compatibility problem with the specific USB drive.  Anyone else dealt with this bizarre situation? Any tips for a stubborn USB boot would be hugely appreciated – I'm seriously considering a fresh SSD/NVMe install as a last resort!

**The Last Shot – And What It Really Means**

It was the final seconds of the championship game. Down by one. The pressure was a physical thing, a weight on my chest. I'd practiced this shot a thousand times, but in that moment, everything felt hazy. We were playing in 2022, and the energy in the arena was electric. 

I took the shot. It rimmed out. Silence.  It wasn't about the loss, though. It was the realization that you can prepare relentlessly, but sometimes, the game decides.  That last shot – it wasn't just about scoring; it was about accepting the outcome, learning from the attempt, and moving forward. A valuable lesson, not just for basketball, but for life.
