**Finding My Team: More Than Just a Score**

2022 felt like a year of searching, honestly. Not just for a new job or a better apartment, but for *connection*. I’d been playing pickup basketball pretty regularly, and while I was getting better at the game, I was realizing it wasn't fulfilling me the way I’d hoped. I craved a team, a group of people who understood the quiet frustration of a missed shot and the pure joy of a well-executed play. 

It’s funny, I was looking for a clan in a totally different world – an online gaming group – but the core desire was the same: a friendly community.  I wanted a space where ‘PvP’ wasn't just about winning, but about pushing each other to improve, and ‘PVE’ was a shared adventure.  

I’m realizing now that sports, and really any team activity, is about so much more than the final score. It’s about the people you’re beside, the support you offer, and the shared experience of striving together.  Finding that felt…well, it felt really good.
