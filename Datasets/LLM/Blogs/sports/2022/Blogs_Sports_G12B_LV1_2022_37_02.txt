## The Weirdest Root of My Auburn Dislike (and It Involves a Mascot)

It's 2022, and college football rivalries are practically woven into the fabric of our lives. We dissect every play, every recruiting class, every coach's questionable tie choice. But sometimes, the origin of those rivalries is… utterly bizarre.

I’ve always felt a certain *something* about South Carolina. Not a deep, seething hatred, but a persistent, low-level annoyance. And it took me years to realize where it stemmed from. It wasn't a bad game, a controversial call, or even a particularly nasty comment. 

It was the Gamecock mascot.

Specifically, seeing it relentlessly chasing people during a game in 2015. I was visiting a friend, and the sheer *intensity* of that feathered fury just rubbed me the wrong way. It felt… excessive. Petty, even. And somehow, that image got permanently linked in my brain to the entire South Carolina program. 

Ridiculous, right? But that's the funny thing about fandom. Sometimes, it's the weirdest, most insignificant things that stick.



Hope this fits the bill!
