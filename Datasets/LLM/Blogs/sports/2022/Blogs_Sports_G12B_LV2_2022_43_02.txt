## The Quiet Hum of Disappointment (and Hope)

Okay, so I didn't make the rec league softball team this year. Brutal, right? I've played for five years running, and this time… nothing. The email arrived on a Tuesday, sandwiched between cat videos and work deadlines. It just felt…deflating. 

It's more than just softball, I think. It's about that feeling of belonging, of a regular routine and camaraderie. 2022 has been a year of shifting sands, and losing that little anchor stung more than I expected. 

But you know what? It's also a chance. A chance to explore something new, maybe finally take that pottery class. Disappointment is a weird motivator, isn’t it? Here's hoping the next adventure is just around the corner.
