It was late 2022, and I was stuck in a rut during the FIFA Weekend League. Every match felt the same: my opponents swarming me with relentless high pressure, forcing mistakes until my controller was nearly a casualty of my frustration. I knew my usual tactics weren't cutting it.

So, I went back to the drawing board. I committed to a new philosophy: calm, deliberate possession. But the real breakthrough came from a different angleâ€”literally. I finally tweaked my camera settings to a wider view. Suddenly, the entire pitch opened up. I could actually see the width I was supposed to be using.

Hugging the sideline went from a vague instruction to a genuine strategy. I started spotting those darting runs from my wingers, finding the open man with a simple pass into space instead of a hopeful punt into traffic. That small visual adjustment transformed the game from a frantic struggle into a chess match. It wasn't about overpowering my opponent anymore; it was about out-thinking them, and for the first time in weeks, I felt in control.
