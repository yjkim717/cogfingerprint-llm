### The Real Victory Lap

It was the final game of our over-40 rec league season in 2022. The score was tied, and my knees were screaming louder than the spectators. The play came to me—a slow roller to shortstop. A few years ago, I’d have made a flashy, off-balance throw. But that night, I just got my body in front of it, secured the ball with two hands, and made the simple, sure out at first.

We lost in extra innings, but driving home, I didn’t feel an ounce of defeat. That simple play was my personal championship. It wasn’t about the highlight reel anymore; it was about the quiet competence that comes with age. The victory was no longer in the score, but in still being in the game, playing smart, and loving the feel of the dirt on my cleats. It’s a different kind of win, one that feels deeper and, honestly, a whole lot better.
