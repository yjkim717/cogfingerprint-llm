There’s a shoebox in my closet, tucked behind old sneakers, holding a stack of my dad’s baseball cards from the ’80s. Last week, I pulled them out, the cardboard edges soft with age. I found myself wondering, just like I do with my old Magic cards—should I get these graded?

In 2022, it’s not just about nostalgia; it’s an investment question. That mint-condition rookie card? Grading could skyrocket its value. But the one with the bent corner? Maybe it’s worth more to me as a memory. It’s a delicate balance between preserving a piece of sports history and recognizing what’s truly priceless. Sometimes, the real value isn’t in the grade, but in the story it tells.
