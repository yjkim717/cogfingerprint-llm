>## The Petty Roots of Rivalry: My K-State vs. South Carolina Story

Okay, let's be honest. College football rivalries aren't always born from epic championship games or legendary clashes. Sometimes, they simmer from the *weirdest* little things. I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, especially with K-State and South Carolina facing off. 

Mine? It stems from a single, fleeting moment in 2012. I was a wide-eyed freshman, decked out in my purple K-State gear, watching the game. South Carolina’s Dylan Thompson threw a… well, let’s just say it was an *unfortunate* interception. The look of utter frustration on his face? It just rubbed me the *wrong* way. 

It’s ridiculous, I know. A single play shouldn’t define a team or a player. But that image, that moment of frustration, somehow cemented a little seed of dislike. And ten years later, every time I see South Carolina, I remember that interception. Anyone else have a similarly petty origin story for their team loyalty? Let's hear them!
