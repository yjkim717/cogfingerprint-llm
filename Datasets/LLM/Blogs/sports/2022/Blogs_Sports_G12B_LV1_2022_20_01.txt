## The Game, the Glitch, and the Gut Punch

Ugh, 2022 has thrown me a curveball I wasn’t expecting. Remember that epic fantasy football season I was having? I was *this* close to the championship. Then, disaster struck. A simple attempt to clear some space on my laptop – a digital spring cleaning, really – resulted in accidentally deleting a massive folder of saved spreadsheets and stats I’d meticulously built up all season.

Panic doesn't even cover it. It felt like losing the game right before the final whistle. Thankfully, a frantic hour of data recovery software later, I managed to salvage most of it. Lesson learned: back everything up! It’s a painful reminder that even the best strategies can be undone by a single, careless click.
