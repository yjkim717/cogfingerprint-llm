**The Upsets We Remember: Why Saint Peter's Still Haunts Me**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single tournament can completely warp your perception of “possible”? 2022 was *that* year for college basketball. I’m talking, of course, about Saint Peter’s. 

I’ll admit, I watched the early rounds with a healthy dose of skepticism. A 15-seed upsetting a top seed? Sure, it happens. But then Saint Peter’s just… kept winning. And winning. And defying all the odds. The analytics were fascinating, weren't they?  Everyone was throwing around "probability" and "statistical anomalies," trying to explain how a small school from New Jersey could be legitimately in the conversation.

I remember scrolling through the betting odds before each game, seeing how they shifted, how the public’s confidence seemed to drain away with every Saint Peter's victory. It wasn’t just about the basketball; it was about the sheer, improbable joy of witnessing something so unexpected. 

What struck me most wasn't just *that* they won, but *how* they won. They weren't relying on flashy plays or dominant individual performances. It was grit, determination, and a surprisingly effective defensive system. 

Looking back, it’s funny how quickly the narrative shifted.  They were the lovable underdogs, then suddenly, they were a legitimate threat.  And then… they lost in the second round.  

But the memory of that improbable run, of Saint Peter’s proving that anything is possible, still lingers. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most captivating stories aren't about the inevitable outcome, but the beautiful, chaotic journey of the unexpected.
