## Witnessing History: Bowers and a Record-Breaking Season

Remember that feeling when you see something truly special unfold? This year, watching Brock Bowers at UGA was like that. The guy shattered the single-season receiving touchdown record – twelve! – and it felt monumental. Beyond the stats, it was the sheer joy and highlight-reel plays that stuck with me. A season to remember, for sure.
