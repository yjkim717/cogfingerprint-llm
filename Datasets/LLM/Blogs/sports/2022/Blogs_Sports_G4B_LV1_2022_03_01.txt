Okay, let's be honest, there’s something *special* about Monday Night Football, especially when it’s a divisional showdown. Last night’s Saints vs. Buccaneers game had that electric feeling – the pre-game buzz, the anticipation for those gameday activities, and of course, the iconic Color Rush jerseys. Seeing those purple and gold clash under the lights was a treat! It’s easy to get caught up in the score, but honestly, moments like those, the energy of the crowd, and the thrill of a close game… that’s what really sticks with you.  A solid win for the Saints, but it was a great way to kick off the week. ⚜️🏈 #Saints #Buccaneers #MNF #ColorRush 2022
