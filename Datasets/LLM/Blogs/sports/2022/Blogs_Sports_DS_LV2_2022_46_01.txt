### The Year I Fell Back in Love with the Game (From the Couch)

It was the winter of 2022, and I found myself yelling at a television screen with a passion I hadn’t felt in years. It wasn't a political debate or a season finale of a prestige drama. It was the World Cup. More specifically, it was a tense, heart-stopping penalty shootout that had me on the edge of my sofa, my knuckles white.

And in that moment, a thought hit me with the force of a perfectly struck volley: I’d missed this.

For the better part of a decade, my relationship with sports had been… complicated. In my youth, sports were everything. They were the crisp autumn air of Friday night football games, the squeak of sneakers on a gym floor, the raw, blistered hands from too many baseball practices. It was pure, unadulterated passion. But as life got busy—college, a career, the general weight of adulthood—that passion faded into a background hum. I’d check scores on my phone, maybe catch the highlights, but the *feeling* was gone. Sports became data points, another stream of information in an already overflowing river.

Then came 2022. Maybe it was the world slowly re-opening, a collective hunger for shared experiences after years of isolation. Maybe I was just ready. But I started watching again. Really watching.

It began with the Premier League, with its relentless pace and heartbreaking drama. Then the NBA playoffs, a masterclass in athleticism and nerve. And it all culminated with that World Cup in Qatar. I wasn't just watching games; I was witnessing stories.

I saw veterans like Lionel Messi, carrying the hopes of a nation on his shoulders, finally grasp the one trophy that had eluded him. It wasn't just a victory; it was the closing chapter of a fairy tale. I saw underdogs defy every expectation, and superstars crumble under the pressure. I saw pure, unfiltered joy and gut-wrenching despair, all within the span of 90 minutes.

And I realized something crucial. I wasn’t watching for the stats or the fantasy league points anymore. I was watching for the humanity. The sport itself was just the stage. The real drama was in the faces of the players, the agony of a missed shot, the ecstasy of a last-minute goal. It was a reminder that beneath the multi-billion dollar industry and the celebrity endorsements, this was still about people striving for something extraordinary.

In 2022, sports didn’t give me back my youth. That’s gone, and that’s okay. Instead, it gave me a new perspective. It taught me that fandom isn't about blind allegiance or knowing every player's transfer value. It's about allowing yourself to be swept up in a narrative, to feel a connection to a struggle that has nothing and everything to do with you.

So now, I still yell at the TV. But there’s a smile on my face. I’ve fallen back in love with the game, not for the escape it provides, but for the very real, very human connection it reaffirms. And honestly? It feels great to be back.
