## Finding My Flow: How Morning Rituals Fueled My Comeback

Honestly, 2022 felt…off for a while. I’d lost that spark, that feeling of being truly *present* in my body. I used to live and breathe early morning gym sessions, but somewhere along the way, life just…happened. Work got crazy, motivation dipped, and suddenly, those endorphins were a distant memory.

But I missed it. I missed the feeling of strength, the clarity of mind, and the quiet satisfaction of pushing myself. So, I decided to rebuild, slowly. It wasn’t about drastic changes, but about establishing a consistent morning routine.

Now, my days start with a massive smoothie – seriously, it’s a colorful concoction of spinach, berries, banana, and a scoop of beet root powder (seriously, try it for the recovery!). Then, it's straight to the gym. I'm not chasing personal bests every day. Sometimes it’s just a light jog, other times it's focused strength training. The key is *showing up*.

And the recovery? That’s become just as important. Stretching, foam rolling, and really listening to what my body needs. It feels less like a chore and more like an act of self-care. 

It's been a gradual process, but honestly, this morning ritual has been a game-changer. It’s not just about the physical benefits; it’s about setting a positive tone for the entire day and reconnecting with myself. It’s a reminder that even small acts of intentionality can have a huge impact. Anyone else finding their way back to a routine they love?
