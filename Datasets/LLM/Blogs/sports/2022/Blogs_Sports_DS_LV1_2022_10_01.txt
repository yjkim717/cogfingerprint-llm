It’s 2022, and as a lifelong Blazers fan, I’ve been thinking a lot about loyalty versus legacy. CJ McCollum has been our steady mid-range shooter, a clutch player when the game is on the line. But now, with the team in a rebuilding process, his name keeps surfacing in trade rumors.

It’s a tough reality. You want to see a player like CJ succeed here, but you also want the team to build a true contending roster. Trading CJ feels like turning a page—necessary, yet bittersweet. Wherever he lands, I hope it’s with a team that truly values what he brings. Sometimes, the right move for the franchise means saying a hard goodbye to a fan favorite.
