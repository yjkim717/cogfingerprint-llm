## The Echo of the Crowd: Why I Miss the Shared Experience

Remember the roar? Back in 2022, scrolling through endless highlight reels just wasn't the same as being *there*. My son, a budding gamer, was obsessed with sharing his Xbox gameplay – the victories, the near misses, even the hilarious fails. He wanted to upload it all to YouTube, complete with the game chat banter. 

But those five-minute clip limits! It felt like trying to capture lightning in a bottle. We briefly considered Twitch, but it wasn't quite the same as the curated experience he envisioned. It made me realize something: digital sharing is great, but it can’t replicate the electric energy of a shared experience, whether it's a stadium packed with fans or just a room full of friends cheering on a game. That raw, communal joy? That's something I hope we don't lose.
