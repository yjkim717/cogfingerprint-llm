"Still salty about my NCAA 14 Online Dynasty experience. I built a team from scratch, but my progress was ruined by a 'Level 0' coach who didn't know the game. To make matters worse, I got penalized for 'instacommits' - recruiting players too quickly. It was frustrating, but it taught me a valuable lesson. In the real world, coaches are held accountable for their recruits. Maybe EA Sports was trying to simulate that. Either way, it's a memory that still stings. Online Dynasty may be old, but its challenges remain relatable."
