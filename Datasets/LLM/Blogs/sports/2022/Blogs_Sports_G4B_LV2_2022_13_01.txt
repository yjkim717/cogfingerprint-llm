**The Unexpected Rally**

It’s funny, isn’t it? I was watching the Cubs last fall, feeling pretty deflated after a string of losses. My dad, a lifelong baseball fan, was texting me updates – quick, easy replies to the game, showing me key plays on his Android. It made me realize how different our experiences were. I was glued to the TV, while he was right in the action, instantly connected.  That simple text stream felt like a mini-rally – a reminder that sometimes, the best way to follow something you love is to be part of it, not just watching.
