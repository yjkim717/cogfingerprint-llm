## The Agony of "Suns in Four"

It's 2022, and the echo of "Suns in Four" still rings in my ears, a bittersweet torment. As a Phoenix Suns fan, I believed it. We *all* believed it. But playoff heartbreak has become a familiar foe. Bleacher Report headlines scream disappointment, and the curse feels real. It's more than just losing; it's the agonizing near-misses, the what-ifs that linger. Maybe next year? Please, just *next* year.
