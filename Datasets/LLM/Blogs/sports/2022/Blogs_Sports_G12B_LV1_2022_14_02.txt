## A Little Flair for the Fandom

Isn't it neat when a community really *gets* its fans? I stumbled across the KC Roos subreddit the other day and was pleasantly surprised! They’ve rolled out new user flairs – seriously cool retro designs and options to rep your favorite Summit League team. Even a Wichita State shout-out! It’s a small thing, but it just shows a genuine appreciation for the passion surrounding college hoops. Makes you feel a little more connected, doesn’t it?
