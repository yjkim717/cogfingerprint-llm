## The Unexpected Beauty of a Long Game

Something strange happened with my liquid cultures recently, and it got me thinking about persistence – something I’ve been wrestling with lately, both in my mushroom growing hobby and, honestly, in following my favorite basketball team. 

I noticed these incredible swirling patterns of mycelium in my LC jars, like miniature galaxies forming. It was beautiful, almost mesmerizing! But it also sparked a question: are these patterns a sign of healthy growth, or a warning of potential contamination? 

It reminded me of watching my team struggle through a tough season in 2022. There were setbacks, frustrating losses, but seeing them keep grinding, adapting, and showing up every game… that’s what really stuck with me. Sometimes, the most rewarding outcomes come from weathering the unexpected turns and sticking with the long game.
