"The Petty Side of Fandom: Why I Love to Hate Certain College Football Teams". As I scrolled through Reddit in 2022, I chuckled at the hilarious reasons people despise certain college football teams.

It's silly, but embracing these quirks makes the game more entertaining and connects me to fellow fans who share my passions and, yes, grudges.
