It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through old NBA highlights when I see Bill Simmons tweet about his all-time celebrity crush list. It takes me right back to middle school—that awkward, heart-thumping era of puberty when my own crushes were shaped by whatever game was on TV. Back then, it was all about the flashy point guard with the killer crossover; today, my preferences have evolved toward the steady veteran leader. Funny how time reshapes not just our taste in players, but in people, too. It makes me wonder: if our crushes are tied to the timing of our own growth, what does Bill’s list say about his journey? Guess we’re all just nostalgic for the versions of ourselves that first felt that spark.
