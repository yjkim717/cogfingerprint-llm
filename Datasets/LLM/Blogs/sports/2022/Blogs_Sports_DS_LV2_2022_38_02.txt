### The Stories We Tell Ourselves After Two Weeks

It’s a strange and wonderful time to be a sports fan, this early part of the season. The sample size is microscopic, the narratives are fresh out of the box, and every fanbase—save for maybe one or two perpetually cursed franchises—is clinging to a sliver of hope. We’re only two weeks into the 2022 NFL season, and already, the power rankings have started to solidify into a kind of gospel. You’ve seen them. The Buffalo Bills, after dismantling the reigning champion Rams and then doing unspeakable things to the Titans, sit confidently at the top. The Kansas City Chiefs, despite a thrilling, hair-pulling loss to the Ravens, are still lurking in that top tier. And then there are teams like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who, even with a banged-up offensive line and a 45-year-old quarterback, command respect based on reputation alone.

But here’s the thing I’ve learned, both as a writer and a lifelong fan: these rankings, these cold, hard numbers and logical analyses, they only tell half the story. The other half is written in the frantic, hopeful, and often irrational hearts of the fans. It’s the story we tell ourselves.

I was talking to my friend Mike, a die-hard Bills fan, the other day. There’s a new kind of energy in his voice this year, one I haven’t heard before. It’s not the desperate hope of the underdog; that was 2020. It’s not the scarred, cautious optimism of last season, the one that ended in thirteen seconds of heartbreak in Kansas City. No, this is different. This is the quiet, steady confidence of a team that knows it’s the best, and a fanbase that is daring, just daring, to believe it with them.

“It feels different,” he told me, and I could hear the smile through the phone. “It’s not just that we’re winning. It’s *how* we’re winning. It feels… inevitable.”

Inevitable. What a powerful, dangerous word for a sports fan. It’s the kind of word that can make you feel like you’re floating in September, only to have the ground fall out from under you in January. But after two weeks of watching Josh Allen play like a video game character with all the cheat codes activated, you can’t blame them for feeling it. Their story, right now, is a superhero origin tale reaching its climax.

Then you look at Kansas City. Their story, according to the pundits, is one of slight vulnerability. The loss of Tyreek Hill was supposed to clip their wings, to ground the most explosive offense in the league. And in that Week 2 loss to Baltimore, where they couldn't quite seal the deal, the narrative vultures began to circle. "See?" they said. "The AFC runs through Buffalo now."

But is that the real story? Or is the real story the fact that Patrick Mahomes still threw for over 300 yards and two touchdowns, that he was a two-point conversion away from forcing overtime, and that he’s still, you know, Patrick Mah
