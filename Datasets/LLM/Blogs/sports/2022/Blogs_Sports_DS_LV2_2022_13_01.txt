The final buzzer echoed through the empty arena. 2022 was supposed to be our year. We had the plays, the drive. But in that crushing silence, I didn't think about the scoreboard. I thought about the bus rides, the inside jokes, the shared exhaustion after practice. We didn't win the championship, but we built something stronger: a team. Sometimes the biggest victories aren't the ones they put on a banner. They're the ones you carry in your heart.
