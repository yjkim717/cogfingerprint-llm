**The Ghosts of Playoff Past: Why Some Teams Just Can’t Catch Lightning**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single season can feel like an eternity of heartbreak for some fans? As we wrapped up the 2022 NFL playoffs, I found myself digging into some historical data – specifically, looking at which teams consistently find themselves on the wrong side of the Super Bowl spotlight. And honestly, it’s a sobering look.

There’s this fascinating pattern emerging, a ghostly presence in the annals of football history. Certain teams, year after year, are eliminated *by* the eventual champion. It’s not about a single bad game; it’s a frustrating, almost predictable cycle of near misses and agonizing defeats. 

I started thinking about it through the lens of 2022 – the Bills, so close, yet again. The 49ers, consistently dominant but always falling short. It’s a reminder that parity in the NFL is a beautiful, brutal illusion. 

Perhaps it’s the pressure of being “almost there,” the weight of expectation. Or maybe it's just the sheer unpredictability of a single playoff game. Whatever the reason, these teams become symbols of that frustrating, heartbreaking reality – a testament to the fact that sometimes, despite your best efforts, destiny has other plans.  It’s a humbling thought, and a strangely compelling one.
