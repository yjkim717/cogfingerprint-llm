**The Day Numbers Said “Believe”**

Remember 2022? It felt like a year of improbable moments, didn’t it? And for a few glorious weeks, Saint Peter’s University became the very embodiment of that feeling. I, like so many others, was completely captivated by the sheer audacity of their run in the NCAA Tournament. 

It wasn’t just the underdog story – though that was a huge part of it. What really struck me was the Reddit thread detailing the user’s analysis. Seriously, someone had crunched the numbers, meticulously calculating Saint Peter’s odds of winning the whole thing, comparing them to every other 15-seed in the last 21 years.  Probability, statistics… it sounded so clinical, so detached. 

But those numbers whispered something different. They suggested a chance, a legitimate possibility, that felt completely out of sync with the usual bracket predictions. It was a reminder that sometimes, the most powerful narratives aren't built on gut feeling alone, but on a deep dive into the potential. 

It made me think about how we often dismiss the seemingly impossible. How we build up mental walls against the idea of something extraordinary happening to *us*.  Saint Peter’s showed us, in the most spectacular way, that a little mathematical faith – and a whole lot of heart – can sometimes rewrite the odds.
