## The Silence in Kinnick and Jack Trice: A Marching Band Reflection

It’s 2022, and the crisp autumn air carries the scent of popcorn and anticipation for college football. But something’s been missing these past few years – the vibrant energy of marching bands at the Iowa-Iowa State games. It’s a strange feeling, watching those rivalry matchups without the booming drums and soaring brass. 

The history behind it is a bit complicated, a series of unfortunate incidents that led to a self-imposed ban on both schools bringing their bands to those away games. It’s a sad consequence, really. These bands aren’t just noise; they’re a vital part of the atmosphere, a visual representation of school spirit. 

I was reading recently that Iowa State’s band will actually be making an appearance in Lawrence, Kansas this year. Shows you how much travel and performance mean to these students. It makes you wonder, will we ever see the Hawkeyes’ “Iowa Marching Band” back in Ames? Hopefully, someday, we can find a way to restore that tradition and fill the stadiums with music once again.
