## The Unexpected Joy of a Taskmaster Tiebreaker

Okay, hear me out. I know it’s not exactly the Olympics, but the finale of Taskmaster Series 14 felt genuinely thrilling. Fern Brady and John Kearns, two gloriously chaotic contestants, ended up tied! Can you believe it? 

The show, a hilarious competition of absurd tasks, rarely leaves you on such a precipice. It felt wonderfully unpredictable. Then came the tiebreaker – a frankly bizarre challenge involving rubber chickens and a paddling pool. 

Watching Dara Tréacy, the ever-observant host, oversee the madness was brilliant. Ultimately, Kearns edged out Brady, but the whole thing just highlighted the joy of appreciating the unexpected in competition. It reminded me that sometimes, the journey and the sheer absurdity are more rewarding than a clear-cut victory. Seriously, who needs traditional sports when you have this?
