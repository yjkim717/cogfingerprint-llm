There’s something uniquely nerve-wracking about a bye week when you’re the one holding the belt. Here we are, Oregon fans, sitting with this mythical College Football Belt in our grasp, and all we can do is wait. It’s a strange limbo. You watch other games—seeing Baylor grind, BYU pull off an upset—and you can’t help but feel the target on your back growing larger.

This isn’t just any trophy; it’s a story, a legacy passed from champion to champion. And now, it’s our turn to defend it. The upcoming UCLA game isn’t just another Pac-12 showdown. It’s for all the bragging rights, for the right to say we’re still the team to beat in 2022. The anticipation is a mix of pride and pure anxiety. We’ve earned this spot, but keeping it? That’s the real test. So here’s to hoping our Ducks are resting up, because come game day, we need to be ready to fight to keep our story going.
