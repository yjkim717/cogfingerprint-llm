## Those Rare Sweeps: Remembering When the Cardinals Dominated the AL East

Itâ€™s funny, isn't it, how certain baseball memories stick with you? I was digging through Cardinals history the other day, and stumbled upon a quirky little fact: we haven't swept many AL East teams. Apparently, just once against each! 

Thinking back, those sweeps *do* feel special, a little flash of complete dominance. It's not about the wins themselves, but the feeling - that momentum, that confidence radiating from the team. 

It makes you appreciate the grind of a long season. Sweeps are rare gems. Here's hoping we can add a few more to the record books soon! What's *your* favorite Cardinals sweep memory? Let me know in the comments!
