### The View From the Top is Lonely (And Other Lessons from the Eagles' Ascent)

I was scrolling through my phone this morning, a practiced ritual of coffee-sipping and digital grazing, when I saw it again. Another notification, another headline. “Composite NFL Power Rankings: Eagles Unanimous No. 1.” It was Week 15 of the 2022 season, and according to the cold, hard calculus of football analytics and the gut feelings of pundits from every major sports outlet, my Philadelphia Eagles were the best team in the league.

My first reaction wasn’t a cheer or a fist pump. It was a slow, deep breath, held for a second too long. And in that quiet space, a single, treacherous thought whispered: *I remember when this felt different.*

This isn’t a post about stats, though the numbers are dazzling. It’s not really about the “how” of this magnificent season—the surgical precision of Jalen Hurts, the relentless hunger of that defensive line, the masterful script of Coach Sirianni. You can get that anywhere. This is about the “what now?” that settles in after the confetti of weekly victories has been swept away. This is about the strange, weighty feeling of being on top.

It’s a feeling I suspect a lot of us know, in our own ways. That promotion you fought for finally lands in your lap. The project you poured your soul into is met with universal acclaim. The dream you visualized for years suddenly becomes your waking reality. And in that moment of triumph, a part of you, the part that remembers the climb, gets a little nervous. Because the view from the top is breathtaking, but it’s also incredibly lonely.

**I remember the climb.**

I remember seasons where “Power Rankings” were something we read with a sense of grim duty, not giddy anticipation. I remember the years of hoping for 9-7, of clinging to wildcard scenarios in December that required three other teams to lose and a planetary alignment over Lincoln Financial Field. I remember the frustration, the heartbreak, the “so close, yet so far” moments that define a fanbase’s character as much as the championships do.

That struggle, as painful as it was, was also… comfortable. There’s a strange camaraderie in shared suffering. There’s a unifying fire in having a common enemy, whether it’s a rival team, a questionable referee call, or the general, agonizing “almost” that seemed to haunt this city. We were the underdogs, the gritty, no-one-believes-in-us crew from Philly. It’s an identity we wear like a badge of honor. It’s in our DNA.

And now? Now, everyone believes in us. The target isn’t just on our backs; it’s a bullseye, painted in midnight green, with a spotlight on it. Every team, from the struggling also-ran to the fellow contender, is going to give us their absolute best shot. There are no more surprises. The element of being the hunter is gone; we are now the hunted.

This is the paradox of success. You spend your whole life striving for the summit, but no one tells you that the air gets thinner up there. The expectations
