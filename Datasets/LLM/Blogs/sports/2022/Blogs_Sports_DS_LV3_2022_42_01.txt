It’s 2022, and I can’t help but reflect on Jaylen Nowell’s journey this season. Watching him step up when others struggled, I kept thinking: why isn’t he getting more minutes? His impact is undeniable—every time he’s on the floor, there’s a spark. The team just flows better.

It makes you wonder about coaching decisions. When key players underperform, shouldn’t performance dictate playing time? Nowell brings energy, consistency, and that clutch factor we’ve been missing. Trusting him feels like trusting the heartbeat of the game.

Sometimes, the answer isn’t in big names, but in giving chances where they’re earned. Here’s hoping the coaching staff sees what we all do.
