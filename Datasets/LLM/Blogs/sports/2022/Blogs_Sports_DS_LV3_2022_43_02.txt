The whistle shrieked, cutting through the roar of the stadium. My hands trembled as I stared at the scoreboard: 2-1, final minutes. All season, I’d prided myself on being the lone striker, the one who never asked for help, believing that true athletes "git gud" on their own. But this opponent was different—a relentless defense that felt like a final boss, shutting down every solo attempt I made.

In that breathless huddle, my pride finally cracked. "I need a decoy on the left," I admitted, the words foreign on my tongue. My teammate nodded, a silent pact forged in desperation. It was our "Blasphemous Blade"—a play we’d mocked in practice for relying on others.

The ball came, the run was made, and the net bulged. 2-2. We didn’t win, but we didn’t lose either. In 2022, I learned that sometimes the strongest move isn’t a show of solitary strength, but the courage to summon help and trust in your team.
