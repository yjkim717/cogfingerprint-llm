## That Weird Celtics Run Felt…Different, Right?

Seriously, looking back at the Celtics’ 2022 playoff push, it felt almost *too* perfect for a stretch. Like, an unbelievable consistency. I know, ridiculous, right? But it got me thinking – are there unseen factors influencing performance? Maybe not radiation treatment of plants, but…something. Just a random thought sparked by all the conversations about controlled growing environments these days. Anyone else get that vibe?

**Explanation of how it relates to the keywords (loosely):**

*   **Radiation/Growing Practices:** The "radiation treatment of plants" idea is abstracted into a metaphor for unseen, potentially artificial influences on performance.
*   **Massachusetts:** The specific reference to the Celtics grounds the post in a regional context.
*   **Regulations:** The implication is that there might be rules or systems in place that affect outcomes, mirroring the regulatory discussions in the original summary.



I hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
