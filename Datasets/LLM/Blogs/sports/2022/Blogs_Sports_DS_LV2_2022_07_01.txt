### The Unlikely Coach on the Sidelines

It’s funny where you find life’s little lessons. For me, in the fall of 2022, it was on a patchy soccer field, watching my eight-year-old niece’s team get thoroughly outplayed.

I wasn’t the coach—just the designated snack-bringer and cheerleader. But as I stood there in the crisp air, I saw something that stuck with me more than any championship game ever has.

Our team, the “Lightning Bolts,” were down by four goals. The other team was bigger, faster, and clearly more skilled. You could see the frustration on our kids’ faces, their shoulders slumping with every near-miss. Then, something shifted. It wasn’t a dramatic, movie-style comeback. It was quieter than that.

Our smallest player, a girl named Chloe, managed to steal the ball. She dribbled it maybe ten feet before being swarmed. Instead of panicking, she looked up, saw a teammate, and passed it off. They didn’t score. In fact, they lost the ball almost immediately. But in that one moment, they had chosen to try *together*.

That’s when I saw the real victory. The coach on our sideline wasn’t yelling about formations or yelling at the ref. He was clapping. “Great effort, Chloe! Way to look for the pass, Alex!”

The final whistle blew, and the scoreboard wasn’t kind. But as the kids gathered around him, their faces weren’t etched with defeat. They were buzzing about that one pass, that one block our goalie made. They had found joy in the attempt, not the outcome.

I drove home that day realizing I’d witnessed a masterclass in what really matters. It’s not about being the biggest or the best on the field. It’s about the spirit you foster. It’s about creating a space where trying your hardest and lifting up your teammates is the real win. And honestly, I think we could all use a coach like that in our corner.
