That first time I laced up my running shoes in 2022, it felt like a chore. But as the months passed, something shifted. It wasn't about the miles anymore; it was about the quiet rhythm of my breath and the clarity that came with it. The track became my therapist's couch, a place where I could outrun my anxieties and finally hear my own thoughts. Funny how a simple sport can become a sanctuary.
