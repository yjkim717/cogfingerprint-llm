It’s 2022, and I’ll admit it: some of my sports grudges are ridiculously petty. Take the Kansas State fan I saw last week—their license plate frame was so obnoxiously purple, I caught myself rooting against them in a game I didn’t even care about. Then I remembered South Carolina’s Dylan Thompson, who, years ago, didn’t hold a door open at a restaurant. I’ve held it against the Gamecocks ever since. Sports fandom isn’t always logical; sometimes it’s just personal.
