The whistle echoed across the field in 2022, marking the end of my final high school soccer game. As I stood there, shin guards soaked and chest heaving, the familiar scent of the damp earth and fresh-cut grass filled the air. It was a smell as ingrained in my memory as the plays we’d run for four years.

That season was our “red cedar pavilion”—a beautiful, ambitious project built on sweat and early mornings. But like any costly lumber, the price was high: missed parties, aching muscles, and the pressure to perform. Was the splendor worth the cost?

Now, looking back, I realize we didn’t need a masterpiece to find value. The real beauty was in the “wood staining”—the small, budget-friendly moments. The shared laughter on the bus rides, the quiet encouragement after a missed goal, mixing the tough losses with the sweet victories. It was never just about the trophy; it was the remodel of our character, built not from one perfect material, but from the patchwork of it all. And that’s a structure that lasts long after the season ends.
