As I stepped onto the court for the 2022 tennis tournament, I was taken aback by the sea of spectators. I had expected a more relaxed atmosphere in the off-season, but it seemed like the crowds were just as intense as during the peak summer months. Families with young athletes and enthusiasts alike packed the stands, all cheering on their favorites. It was clear that this popular tournament remained a hotspot for sports enthusiasts, even in October. The energy was electric, and I was thrilled to be a part of it.
