It was 2022, and my husband and I were navigating the world of credit card rewards like a complex playbook. When I added him as an authorized user on my Amex, it felt like a strategic team move. The points bonus was a quick win, like a perfectly executed fast break. But I paused, wondering if the annual fee was worth it versus him getting his own card. It’s a partnership play—weighing shared benefits against individual goals, both on and off the field.
