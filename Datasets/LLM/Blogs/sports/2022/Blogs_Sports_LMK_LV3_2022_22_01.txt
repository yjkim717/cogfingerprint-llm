As I navigated my weight loss journey in 2022, a nagging question arose: can being sick be a 'win' for my goals? When illness struck, my appetite plummeted, and I found myself in a calorie deficit without much effort. While it wasn't a desirable way to shed pounds, it got me thinking - is CICO (calories in, calories out) still at play when we're under the weather? I realized that even on sick days, mindful nutrition is key. Perhaps it's an opportunity to reassess my sedentary behavior and make healthier choices, even when I'm not feeling my best.
