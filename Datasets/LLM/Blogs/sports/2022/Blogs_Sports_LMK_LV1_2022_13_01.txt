As I watched the 2022 World Cup, I couldn't help but think about how sports unite us. Like many, I was glued to my phone, following live updates on SMS. Android users have Google Messages, but iPhone users like my friends were stuck using traditional messaging apps. It got me thinking - when will Apple catch up? Is an iPhone equivalent to Google Messages on the horizon, or will Verizon customers continue to be caught in the cross-platform messaging divide?
