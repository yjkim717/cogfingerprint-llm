There it was again—that familiar sinking feeling as the Utah Jazz’s late-game lead evaporated against the Warriors. It’s the same old story: predictable crunch-time offense funneled through Donovan Mitchell, while defensive lapses, often tied to Rudy Gobert’s limitations on the perimeter, leave them exposed. Year after year, this playoff collapse feels inevitable. As a fan, it’s tough watching a team with so much promise fall into the same traps. You can’t help but wonder if they’ll ever break the cycle or remain that favorable matchup opponents hope to see.
