>## The Unexpected Joy of Watching My Dad Watch Football

It’s weird, isn’t it, how passions get passed down? This year, watching football has felt different. My dad, who’s always been a casual fan, has *really* gotten into it. Like, paints-his-face, meticulously researches stats, yells at the TV kind of into it. 

It started with the excitement around the new season, but it's become more than that. Seeing his genuine joy, his frustration, his quiet analysis… it's honestly been the highlight of Sundays. We used to just flip on the game in the background. Now, it's a shared experience, a connection. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best parts of a game aren't the touchdowns or the wins, but the people you share them with. And in 2022, that felt more important than ever.
