"Sidelined by Tech: A Seller's Frustration on Depop" isn't the only place where updates can cause frustration. As I geared up for the 2022 marathon season, a new tracking feature on my running app threw me off course. Suddenly, I had to log every step, every pace, and every route. While the data was insightful, the constant updates felt overwhelming. Similarly, Depop sellers are feeling the pinch with the latest update requiring tracking details to mark items as shipped. Is all this data worth the extra legwork, or is it just a hurdle to clear?
