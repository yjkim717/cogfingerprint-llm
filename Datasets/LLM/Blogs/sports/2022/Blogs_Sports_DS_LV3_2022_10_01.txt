It’s 2022, and the whispers around Portland are hard to ignore. As a Blazers fan, you watch CJ McCollum, a cornerstone for years, and feel that familiar ache of change. The team is pivoting, embracing a rebuild, and suddenly his future feels like a question mark. It’s a strange limbo—seeing a star’s name float in trade rumors while knowing true contenders seem hesitant. It’s more than a transaction; it’s closing a chapter, wondering where loyalty fits when the gameplan shifts entirely. You just hope the next jersey he wears feels like home.
