It was a rainy Tuesday in 2022, stuck at a blocked intersection after our team’s loss. The car in front had their rival’s bumper sticker, and the driver smirked in the rearview. No wave, no apology—just pure pettiness. That single moment, that unspoken hate, solidified my disdain for their entire team. Funny how a trivial encounter between two strangers can amplify a rivalry, turning every future game into something deeply personal. We weren’t just players and fans; we were rivals, forged in the fire of everyday slights.
