## Feeling a Little Anxious About the Jazz This Playoff Season

Okay, I'm just going to say it: I'm feeling a little uneasy about the Utah Jazz heading into the 2022 playoffs. I *want* to be optimistic, I really do. But seeing some of the chatter online, especially on Reddit, has me thinking. 

There’s a recurring concern – and it's valid – about our consistency. Can we really rely on Donovan Mitchell to carry us every game? And honestly, how do we effectively utilize Rudy Gobert when opposing teams are so clearly game-planning to limit his impact? 

It feels like we’ve got flashes of brilliance on both offense and defense, but those moments aren’t sustainable. I’m hoping this year will be different. I'm hoping we can surprise everyone. But I'm also bracing myself for a potentially frustrating run. Anyone else feeling this way?
