It’s funny how specific obsessions can take hold, right? Lately, I’ve been completely consumed by *Stranger Things*. Not just the show itself, but the little details – like this Reddit thread about a particular shirt. A brown/beige one with a demogorgon and tiny character sketches. It’s a beautiful, almost obsessive, piece of memorabilia. It reminds me of collecting things as a kid – that need to capture a moment, a feeling, a piece of a world you love.  Maybe it’s a little strange, but it’s comforting, somehow.
