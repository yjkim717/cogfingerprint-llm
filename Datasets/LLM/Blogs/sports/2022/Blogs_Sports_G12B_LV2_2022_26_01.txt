 subject: "Beyond the Buzzer: Shai's Words & a Little Hope"

Okay, so last night's Thunder game had me thinking about more than just the score. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s post-game interview was something else. His English – it’s noticeably smoother, more confident. It’s easy to focus on the points, the rebounds, but seeing an athlete genuinely grow beyond the court? It’s inspiring, honestly. A little reminder that dedication shows up in all areas, and that’s a good feeling to carry with you.
