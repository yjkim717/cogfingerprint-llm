**The Unexpected Shift – Remembering Why We Play**

It’s funny, isn’t it? You spend so much time chasing a goal, a win, a personal best, that you sometimes forget *why* you started in the first place.  2022 feels like a year of shifts, honestly – a lot of adjustments to navigate. And it made me think a lot about my own experiences with sports, specifically that feeling of almost losing sight of the core reason you’re out there sweating it out.

I grew up playing soccer. I was obsessed. Every spare moment was spent on a field, honing my skills, pushing my limits. By my junior year of high school, I was pretty good – consistently making the starting lineup, even earning a regional award. But somewhere along the way, the pressure to perform, the need to win, completely swallowed the joy.  It wasn’t fun anymore. 

I remember one particularly grueling practice, the coach screaming instructions, the constant feeling of being judged.  I just…stopped enjoying it.  I started pulling out, making excuses.  It was a really painful realization. 

Looking back, I realized I'd traded the pure pleasure of the game – the camaraderie of my teammates, the feeling of running and connecting, the simple satisfaction of a well-placed pass – for the pursuit of external validation.

It took a while to get back to that place.  It wasn't about becoming *better*; it was about remembering *why* I loved it in the first place.  Sports, at its heart, isn’t always about winning. It's about the effort, the challenge, the shared experience. 

Maybe that's a lesson we all need to revisit, no matter what we’re pursuing – whether it’s a career goal, a creative project, or simply trying to navigate a tricky week.  Let’s remember to focus on the journey, not just the destination.
