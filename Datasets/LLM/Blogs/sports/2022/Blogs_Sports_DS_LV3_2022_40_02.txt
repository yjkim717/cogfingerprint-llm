### The Numbers Don't Lie: What We Can Learn from the Patrick Beverley Debate

I have a confession to make: I love a good sports argument. The kind that spills out of the group chat and into a full-blown, multi-day, evidence-gathering mission. The kind where you find yourself, at 11 PM on a Tuesday, elbow-deep in YouTube compilations and advanced stats pages, trying to prove a point that, in the grand scheme of things, matters very little.

In the spring of 2022, the NBA gifted us one of these glorious, meaningless debates. It was a classic case of on-court trash talk evolving into a full-blown cultural moment. Russell Westbrook, then of the Lakers, had a simple, dismissive critique of Patrick Beverley, his longtime rival: Pat Bev just “runs around” and “does nothing.”

On the surface, it’s a perfect insult. It’s vague, it’s dismissive, and it paints a picture we can all visualize—the frantic, chaotic player whose energy is all noise and no substance. For days, the sports talk universe churned on this. Was Westbrook right? Was Pat Bev all bark and no bite?

And then, the nerds arrived. And by nerds, I mean the brilliant data analysts who track every single movement an NBA player makes. They brought with them the cold, hard facts of **distance traveled**, average speed in **miles per hour**, and a wonderfully quirky stat called **feet per stuff**—a metric that essentially measures how much ground a player covers defensively to make a positive play.

The data was clear, and it was devastating to Westbrook’s claim. Patrick Beverley, it turned out, did not just “run around.” He ran with purpose. He covered more total ground than many of his peers, but his speed was often in controlled bursts—not frantic, chaotic scrambling. He was efficient with his energy, deploying it in precise, high-impact defensive possessions. The “feet per stuff” metric was the clincher; it showed that all that running had a direct, measurable outcome. He was, by the numbers, doing a whole lot of *something*.

This whole saga got me thinking, far beyond the hardwood floors of the NBA. It made me reflect on how often we, in our own lives and careers, are guilty of the same kind of superficial judgment. We see the frantic activity of a colleague and label them “busy but ineffective.” We see someone who seems to be constantly in motion and assume they’re just “running around.” We look for the flashy, easily quantifiable results—the points scored, the sales closed—and we undervalue the immense, often invisible, effort that creates the conditions for success.

I’ve been that person. Early in my career, I was in a marketing role, and there was a woman on our team, Sarah, who was a Pat Bev type. She wasn’t the one presenting the big campaign ideas to the client. She wasn’t the “star.” From my desk, it sometimes looked like she was just… buzzing. Always in and out of meetings, constantly on the phone with vendors, her desk a chaotic landscape of post-it notes and half-finished coffee cups. I remember privately thinking
