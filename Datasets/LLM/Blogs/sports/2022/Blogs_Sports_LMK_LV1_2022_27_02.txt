"Jeremy Peña's impressive 2022 rookie season had me reminiscing about Troy Tulowitzki's debut year. Both shortstops dazzled with their defensive prowess, but Peña's power numbers stood out. While Tulowitzki hit 24 home runs, Peña matched that total with 22. Peña also shone with 3 Defensive Runs Saved. The comparison got me thinking - are we witnessing the rise of another elite shortstop? Only time will tell, but Peña's rookie season has certainly sparked excitement."
