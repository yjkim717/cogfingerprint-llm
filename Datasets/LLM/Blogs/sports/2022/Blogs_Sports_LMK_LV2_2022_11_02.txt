"Game Face: The Power of Sports Quotes" 

In 2022, I stumbled upon a Reddit thread that sparked a fascinating quote game. Participants would mention a character, and others would respond with their most iconic lines. It got me thinking - what about sports quotes? Those motivational one-liners that ignite our passion for the game. From Muhammad Ali's "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee" to Serena Williams' "I always believe I can win," sports quotes evoke emotions and inspire greatness. They remind us that, win or lose, the game is about more than just winning â€“ it's about the journey, the grit, and the triumph.
