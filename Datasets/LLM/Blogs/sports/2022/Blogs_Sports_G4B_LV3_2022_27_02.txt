It’s funny how a single season can completely reshape your perspective on a player. Watching Jeremy Peña in 2022 felt like witnessing a quiet storm – a blend of surprising power and incredible defense.  I found myself instinctively comparing him to Troy Tulowitzki’s rookie year, that initial burst of brilliance. Peña wasn't just hitting home runs; he was anchoring the infield with a confidence that felt earned.  It reminded me that sometimes, the most impactful players are the ones who quietly excel, redefining what’s possible.
