As a parent in 2022, I've seen my son's Xbox gameplay become a big part of his online presence. He's eager to share his gaming experiences on YouTube, but I'm not sure where to start. Can we easily upload his gameplay footage? What about Twitch streaming - will it capture those hilarious game chats with his friends? As I navigate this digital world, I'm learning that sharing his gaming adventures isn't just about tech know-how, it's about connecting with others who share his passions.
