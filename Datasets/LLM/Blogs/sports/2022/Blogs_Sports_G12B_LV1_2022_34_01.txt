## The Bowers Effect

Something felt different this year watching UGA football. Brock Bowers, that name just kept popping up! Seeing him break the single-season receiving touchdown record – twelve! – was genuinely breathtaking. It wasn't just the numbers, though (and they were impressive, alongside his receptions and yards). It was the way he moved, the connection with Edwards... a truly special season to witness.
