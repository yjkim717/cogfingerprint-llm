## Remember When Wrestling *Meant* Something More?

It’s 2022, and wrestling feels… different, doesn't it? Lately, I've been thinking back to the OSW era, those legendary podcasts. Remember how they dissected storylines, really *analyzed* them? It wasn't just about who won or lost. It was about the character journeys, the psychology, the *story*. 

I miss that depth. Even thinking about Hulkamania's rise or David Arquette’s surprising WCW run sparks a feeling of genuine excitement.  Becky Lynch is incredible now, but sometimes I wonder if wrestling's lost a little of that storytelling magic we craved back then. What do you think?
