**The Unexpected Rumble: Tuning into a Deeper Game**

2022 felt like a year of quiet adjustments, honestly. I was spending so much time watching my son’s little league games – he’s a shortstop, a real scrappy kid – and I realized I wasn’t *feeling* the game as much as just *seeing* it. It was like I was observing from a distance, missing the subtle shifts in strategy, the quiet determination in a player’s eyes.

It made me think about how we approach things in life, how we sometimes settle for a surface-level understanding. Like tweaking a bass guitar – adding a third pickup, experimenting with the wiring – it’s about digging deeper, pushing beyond the familiar. 

I started really paying attention to the details: the way a pitcher adjusted his grip, the way a batter squared their stance. It wasn’t about analyzing the game perfectly, but about tuning *into* it.  Just like a bassist fine-tuning their instrument to find that perfect, resonant tone, I was trying to find a more authentic connection to the moments unfolding around me.  It’s a reminder that sometimes the biggest gains come from subtle, persistent adjustments.
