## The Sunday Scaries & the Baseball Card Box

It's 2022, and the Sunday night dread is hitting hard. I found myself staring into a dusty box in the basement – a box overflowing with baseball cards I collected as a kid. Shohei Ohtani rookies, vintage Ken Griffey Jr., a surprisingly well-preserved Cal Ripken Jr. – the whole nine yards. 

Suddenly, a thought popped into my head: are these just nostalgic relics, or could they actually be *worth* something? I know people are getting into collecting again, and the market's wild. It's a far cry from trading with friends after school, but the idea of potentially turning a childhood hobby into a little something extra is intriguing. Maybe I’ll actually do some research… after I finish doom-scrolling, of course.
