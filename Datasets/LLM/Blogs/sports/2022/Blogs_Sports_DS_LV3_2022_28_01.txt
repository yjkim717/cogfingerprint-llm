There’s something deeply personal about holding a piece of cardboard that captures a moment in time—especially when it comes to a player’s rookie card. Take Scott, for example. For collectors like me, the debate over his *true* rookie card is more than just semantics; it’s about pinpointing the exact slice of his journey we want to preserve.

Was it his 1996 MLB debut, immortalized by Topps, where hope and raw talent first met the big leagues? Or was it the 1997 follow-up, the year he clinched Rookie of the Year, cementing his status as a can’t-miss prospect?

In 2022, as I sifted through my collection, I realized it’s not just about scarcity or market value. It’s about the story we connect with—the nervous debut or the triumphant arrival. Each card is a bookmark in a career still being written, and maybe that’s why we care so much. We’re not just collecting; we’re remembering how it felt to watch potential become greatness.
