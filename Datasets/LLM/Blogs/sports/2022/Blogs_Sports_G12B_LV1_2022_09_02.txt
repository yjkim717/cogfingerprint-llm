## The Buzzer-Beater and the Broken Headphones

Remember that Celtics-Bucks series in 2022? Absolutely *intense*. I was glued to the TV, headphones on, ready to feel every shot, every block. Then, halfway through Game 7, my headphones started rattling. Not a pleasant hum, but a full-on, distracting *clatter* with every thump of the ball. 

It was infuriating. I almost tossed them. But I’m a bit of a fixer – always have been. So, I paused the game (risking missing a crucial moment!) and started dismantling the things. Tiny screws, fiddly wires... it was a mess. Turns out, a little plastic piece had cracked. Thankfully, I managed a makeshift repair with some tape and a toothpick.  It wasn’t perfect, but it got me through the rest of the nail-biting game.  Definitely learned a lesson: sometimes, the smallest malfunctions can feel like the biggest setbacks!
