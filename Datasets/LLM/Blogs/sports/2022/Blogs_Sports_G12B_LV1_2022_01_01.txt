>## The Unexpected Joy of Watching My Son Stream His FIFA Dreams

It’s 2022, and my son’s obsession isn't collecting baseball cards – it's FIFA. And not just *playing* it, but streaming his gameplay on Twitch. Honestly, I was skeptical at first. Hours spent yelling at a screen? Seemed a bit much. 

But something shifted when I actually sat down and watched. He’s surprisingly engaging, cracking jokes, explaining his strategies, and genuinely interacting with the small but loyal audience he's built. It’s a window into a world I didn’t understand – the thrill of sharing passion, the community built around a shared love of the game. 

It's a reminder that connection comes in unexpected forms, even through pixels and a headset. And, surprisingly, I'm finding it pretty entertaining. Go get 'em, kid!
