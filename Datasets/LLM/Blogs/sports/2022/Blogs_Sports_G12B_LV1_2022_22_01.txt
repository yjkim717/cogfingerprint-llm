## The Flu and the Fear of Losing It All (Even Just a Little)

Ugh, 2022 has thrown me another curveball – a nasty cold. Nothing groundbreaking, I know, but it's got me thinking about something a little unexpected: my training. Sounds silly, right? When you're feeling rubbish, the last thing you worry about is bicep curls.

But I've been barely eating. My appetite’s vanished, and honestly, forcing down food feels like a chore. The usual post-workout ravenous feeling? Nowhere to be seen. It’s got me fixated on calories, and the creeping fear that even a few days of drastically reduced intake will undo all the hard work I've put in. 

I know logically, a short-term deficit isn’t going to melt away months of gains. My body isn't going to start cannibalizing muscle just because I'm congested! But the athlete in me – the one obsessed with optimization – is panicking a little. It's a strange feeling, prioritizing recovery *and* maintaining progress when all I really want to do is sleep. Hopefully, this passes quickly, and I can get back to feeling (and performing) like myself.
