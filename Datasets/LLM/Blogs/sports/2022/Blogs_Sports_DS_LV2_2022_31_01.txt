That final buzzer in 2022 still echoes. We’d practiced for months, a perfect play drawn up for the championship. I took the last shot, felt the ball leave my fingertips… and watched it rim out. For weeks, that miss defined me. But now I see it differently. It wasn’t an end; it was the moment I learned resilience. Sometimes the biggest wins are the quiet lessons in how you get back up, ready for the next game.
