## That Time I Rooted For the Underdog (and They Actually Won!)

Remember that feeling when you stumble across a team or athlete you just *have* to support? It doesn't matter if they're the clear favourite, or the complete underdog – sometimes, you just click. I had one of those moments last year during the women's Euros. 

I'd always enjoyed football, but I wasn’t intensely invested. Then, watching England, I found myself completely captivated by Alessia Russo. She wasn't the biggest name, wasn't the one plastered all over billboards, but her energy and sheer joy on the pitch were infectious. 

And when she scored *that* goal against Sweden? I genuinely lost it! It was a reminder that sometimes the most memorable moments come from where you least expect them. Anyone else have a surprise sporting hero they cheered on in 2022? Let me know!
