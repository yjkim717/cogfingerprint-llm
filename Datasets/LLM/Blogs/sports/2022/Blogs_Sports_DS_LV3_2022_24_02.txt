The roar of the stadium was a distant memory. It was 2022, and my comeback from a knee injury felt like trying to boot an old computer with a corrupted drive. I had the passion—my "USB" was plugged in, my drive to play was recognized in the team's system. Yet, every time I tried to launch back into the game, I’d fail. My old, reliable moves, my "Windows 10" playbook, just wouldn’t load, blocked by this new "Secure Boot" reality of a stricter coach and a faster, "NVMe" pace on the field.

It was frustrating. I saw teammates adapt, seamlessly installing new systems like "Ubuntu," while I was stuck at the BIOS screen, staring at a blank monitor. I had to stop forcing the old boot sequence. I had to enter my own UEFI settings, reconfigure my fundamentals, and learn a new playbook from the ground up. Sometimes, progress isn't about pushing harder; it's about changing the system you're trying to run.
