As I laced up my running shoes this morning, I couldn't help but think of the frustration some Depop sellers are experiencing with the latest app update. Just like a runner needs to track their progress, Depop now requires sellers to add tracking details to mark items as shipped. While it's a change that's causing some to feel depopped, I see it as a step towards a smoother seller experience. After all, who doesn't love a good underdog story? In 2022, it's all about adapting to the new terrain - and getting those tracking numbers!
