It’s funny how quickly things change in the NBA. Just a couple of seasons ago, CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard felt like Portland’s unshakable backcourt, the heart of a team always on the cusp of something special. Now, in 2022, with the Blazers signaling a rebuild, the buzz is all about where CJ might land next.

I can’t help but feel a little nostalgic. It’s a reminder that in sports, as in life, even the most reliable partnerships eventually face new horizons. For CJ, it’s not an ending—it’s a chance to bring his smooth scoring and veteran presence to a contender that’s one piece away. Change is hard, but it’s also where new legacies begin.
