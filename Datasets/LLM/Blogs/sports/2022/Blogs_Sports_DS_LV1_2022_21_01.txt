### The Unwritten Rules of the Fall

There’s a certain rhythm to an autumn Saturday that feels as old as the game itself. The crispness in the air, the smell of charcoal from a tailgate, and the collective, nervous energy of millions of fans tuning in. In 2022, that rhythm has a familiar beat: Alabama, Ohio State, and Georgia are, once again, sitting at the top of the college football world.

Seeing those names in the Week 6 poll—the Crimson Tide, the Buckeyes, the defending champion Bulldogs—it’s easy to feel a sense of déjà vu. It can seem like a closed loop, an exclusive club where the same uniforms get all the glory. I’ll admit, a part of me yearns for the chaos, for an underdog to crash the party.

But then I remember what that consistency represents. It’s not just about five-star recruits or massive budgets. It’s about a standard. It’s the relentless expectation at Alabama that anything less than perfection is a failure. It’s the surgical precision of Ohio State’s offense, a machine tuned to near-flawlessness. It’s the raw, physical identity Georgia has forged.

These teams aren’t just winning; they are upholding a legacy. And in a world that feels increasingly unpredictable, there’s a strange comfort in that. It’s a reminder that some foundations, no matter how much we might sometimes root for them to shake, are built to last. The challenge for everyone else isn’t just to beat them on the scoreboard, but to build something that can endure like they have. Now, let’s see who’s ready to try.
