It’s funny how a single photo can bring back a flood of memories. Last week, scrolling through our #PhotoFriday entries, I paused at a shot of me and my running buddy, drenched and grinning after a soggy parkrun in early 2022. We’d promised each other we’d just take it easy, but as always, the starting horn fired us up.

That picture, messy and real, got me thinking. It’s not the perfectly framed race photo I treasure most; it’s these candid moments. The shared, breathless laughter, the mud splatters, the unspoken pact to just show up, no matter the weather. In a year that still felt uncertain, these weekly runs became my anchor. They were less about the time on the clock and more about the person running beside me. Here’s to celebrating the stories behind every snapshot. Can’t wait to see yours this Friday
