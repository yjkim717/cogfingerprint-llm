## The Lingering Buzz and the Unexpected Side Effects

Remember that electric feeling after a really intense game? That's kind of what I've been dealing with lately, but not in a good way. It started after getting my booster last fall – a headache I desperately needed to shake. I popped a Tylenol, felt relief, but then… this persistent ringing in my ears. 

It's tinnitus, my doctor says. And honestly, I’m starting to wonder if that Tylenol played a part. It's a strange connection, like a delayed reaction from a chain of events. It’s definitely thrown a wrench in my training, and it's made me think twice about quick fixes. Anyone else experience something similar?
