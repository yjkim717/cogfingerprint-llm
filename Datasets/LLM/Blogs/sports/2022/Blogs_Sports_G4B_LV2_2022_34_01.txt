**That Feeling When a Record Falls**

Honestly, watching Brock Bowers explode through the endzone last year was electric. I was glued to the screen during UGA’s games, and seeing him chase Terrence Edwards’ receiving touchdown record felt… monumental. It wasn’t just about stats; it was about witnessing a player completely dominate. 

There’s something so captivating about watching a record break, a testament to dedication and skill. It reminded me that sports, at their core, are about these incredible individual achievements.  A truly special moment for Bulldog Nation!
