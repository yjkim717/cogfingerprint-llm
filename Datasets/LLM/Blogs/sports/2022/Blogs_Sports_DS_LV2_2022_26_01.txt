Remember those cringey post-game interviews back in 2022? I do. Watching Pokus stumble through them was tough. But last night? He was a different person. Fluent, confident, absolutely balling out on the mic just like on the court. It hit me: that wasn't just talent. That was someone putting in the hard work when no one was watching, transforming in the dark. A powerful reminder for all of us.
