It’s 2022, and I’m diving into my old PS Classic, feeling like a rookie athlete picking up a forgotten sport. Hacking it with Autobleem and Retroboot felt like training for a comeback—nerve-wracking but thrilling. Adding extra hardware for ROMs was my version of upgrading gear, transforming nostalgia into a fresh challenge. Just like in sports, the real win wasn’t just playing the games; it was mastering the process, pushing limits, and reliving those pixelated victories with a renewed passion.
