Even as my chess rating slowly climbs, I’m still dodging trolls at lower levels. It’s 2022, and you’d think a close, hard-fought game would earn respect. Instead, I get annoying taunts mid-match. It’s a frustrating part of the grind—proof that improvement isn’t just about moves, but also keeping your cool when others won’t.
