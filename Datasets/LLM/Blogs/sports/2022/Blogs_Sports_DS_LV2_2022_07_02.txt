The whistle blew, and my heart sank. Another missed penalty. For weeks, I’d been chasing that elusive state of “flow,” where every move feels effortless. The coaches said to focus on the fundamentals, to keep it simple. But I was obsessed with pushing beyond, trying to force that magical, airborne moment of perfect control.

It was 2022, and the pressure was on. I realized I was like that Destiny 2 player, stubbornly trying to max out a stat when sometimes, the real power comes from trusting your foundation. You can’t always force grace; sometimes, you just have to play the game and let it find you. The goal isn’t to defy physics, but to move with them.
