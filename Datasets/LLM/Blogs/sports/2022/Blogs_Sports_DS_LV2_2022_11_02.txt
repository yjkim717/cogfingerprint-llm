The final buzzer echoed through the empty gym, a sound I’d heard a thousand times. But in 2022, it hit differently. I wasn't just leaving another season behind; I was closing a chapter. The squeak of sneakers, the shared exhaustion, the unspoken trust—it was more than a game. It was a language. We weren't just players; we were a unit, a temporary family forged in sweat and strategy. Stepping off that court for the last time, I realized the biggest win wasn't the trophy, but the profound, quiet bond that made every single play matter.
