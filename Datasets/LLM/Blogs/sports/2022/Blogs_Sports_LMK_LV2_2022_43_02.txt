"Sweating Bullets on the Court: My 2022 Basketball Frustration"

I'll never forget the frustration I felt on a sweltering summer court in 2022. I was determined to finally master my three-point shot, but it seemed like the ball was having a different idea. Despite practicing tirelessly, I just couldn't sink a shot to save my life. The more I missed, the more flustered I became. I'd try a new technique, only to have it backfire. My playing partner would make a shot effortlessly, and I'd feel like I was stuck in a rut. As the sun began to set, I'd finally make a basket, only to follow it up with another miss. It was like reliving a Soulsborne nightmare, minus the dark fantasy setting. My 2022 basketball struggles taught me that sometimes, it's not about being good, it's about being patient. And, boy, was I frustrated.
