There’s something about college football season that feels like coming home. Every Saturday, I’d sink into my couch, remote in hand, and let the rhythms of the game wash over me. But last fall, in 2022, I started paying closer attention to the AP Poll—not just the rankings, but the people behind them.

I stumbled across a visualization of voter ballots, a mosaic of opinions that shifted each week. Some voters were steadfast, their logic a through-line in the chaos. Others zigged and zagged, reacting to every stunning upset. It made me think about my own convictions, not just in sports, but in life. How often do we change our minds to fit in with the crowd? How much do we cling to our picks, our teams, our beliefs, just for the sake of consistency?

In the end, the poll wasn’t just about who was number one. It was a mirror, reflecting how we all navigate certainty and doubt, one Saturday at a time.
