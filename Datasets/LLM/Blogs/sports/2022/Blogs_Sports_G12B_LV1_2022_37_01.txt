## The Ghosts in My Dynasty

It's late 2022, and I've fallen down a rabbit hole. A *NCAA 14* rabbit hole, specifically. I'm deep into an online dynasty, and let me tell you, it’s more complicated than any real-world recruiting battle. 

Recently, I hit a snag. My offensive coordinator? Level zero. Utterly clueless. My star quarterback was throwing ducks into double coverage, and I was starting to feel the burn. Then, I realized I’d been a little *too* aggressive with the "InstaCommits" feature – snapping up every five-star prospect in sight. 

Suddenly, my team felt…hollow. A collection of highly-rated players with no real coaching, no cohesion. It's a stark reminder that even in a simulated world, you can’t just stack talent and expect championships. You need a system, a coach, and a little bit of patience. Maybe I'll dial back the InstaCommits and focus on developing what I already have.
