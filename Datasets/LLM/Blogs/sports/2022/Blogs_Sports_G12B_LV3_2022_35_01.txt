## Finding Joy in the Snap: Why I Love Parkrun Photo Friday

Okay, confession time: I’m a sucker for a good community. And the running community? It’s truly something special. Lately, I’ve been loving this little corner of Reddit where runners share their photos – it’s called Photo Friday. 

Scrolling through last week’s submissions just warmed my heart. One showed a runner beaming after hitting a weight loss goal, and another captured a gorgeous sunset during a solo run. Simple moments, beautifully shared. 

It's a great reminder that running isn’t always about the pace or the personal best. Sometimes, it’s just about the feeling, the scenery, the joy of movement. And capturing those moments? Even better. If you’re a runner, and you're looking for a little boost of positivity this week, check it out! It’s a fun, easy way to connect with fellow enthusiasts. (And maybe even share your own snapshot!)
