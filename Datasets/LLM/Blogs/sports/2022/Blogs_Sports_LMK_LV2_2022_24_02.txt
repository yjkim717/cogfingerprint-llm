Here's a reflective blog post on sports:

"Grit and Determination: My 2022 Marathon Story

As I crossed the finish line in 2022, the rush of emotions still feels surreal. Months of training, early morning runs, and sacrifices had all led to this moment. My first marathon was a grueling test of physical and mental endurance, but it was the lessons I learned along the way that I'll carry with me forever. Like troubleshooting a stubborn usb boot issue, I had to be patient and persistent - when one approach didn't work, I tried another. The same grit that helped me power through tough runs is the same determination that helped me overcome obstacles on the road to the finish line. As I look back on my journey, I'm reminded that it's not just about the destination, but about the person you become along the way."
