**The Sound of Progress**

I was watching the Thunder game last month, and something really struck me. It wasn’t the incredible play – though that was fantastic – but a player’s interview. His English had noticeably improved since last season, and he seemed so much more comfortable talking to the media. It made me think about how hard it is to step outside your comfort zone, especially when you’re under the spotlight.  Hearing him speak with fluency felt like… well, like the sound of real progress.  It’s a powerful reminder, isn’t it?
