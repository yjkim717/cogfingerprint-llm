## The Unexpected Lesson from My Local League

Okay, so I finally joined a local softball league this year (2022). I haven’t played since high school, and honestly, I was mostly expecting to embarrass myself. Turns out, I did a little! But something else happened too. We lost a lot – *a lot*. Yet, watching my teammates, win or lose, genuinely supporting each other, that was pretty special. 

It reminded me that sometimes, the best part isn’t the victory. It’s the effort, the camaraderie, the showing up even when you’re not sure you're going to win. It’s about the shared experience, the laughter after a strikeout, the high-fives for a great catch. Who needs a championship when you've got that?
