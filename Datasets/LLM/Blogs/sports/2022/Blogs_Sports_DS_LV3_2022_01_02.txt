It was the fall of 2022, and my son’s Minecraft obsession hit a new peak with the Star Wars pack. He’d saved his Minecoins for weeks, eyes shining with that same excitement I used to have before a big game. But on our Xbox, the download just wouldn’t work. We tried every fix, that familiar parent-coach feeling kicking in—the one where you problem-solve on the sidelines. It reminded me that whether it’s a faulty play or a tech glitch, the real win is in the huddle, figuring it out together. Sometimes the biggest victories happen off the field.
