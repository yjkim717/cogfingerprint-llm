The Taskmaster polls were neck and neck this week! As a huge fan, I was on the edge of my seat as the results rolled in - a dead heat between Fern Brady and John Kearns for favourite contestant. Who will reign supreme in the end? The series has been a wild ride so far, with hilarious challenges and witty banter. I'm loving every minute of Taskmaster series 14 in 2022!
