**The Lillard Question – Still Haunting Portland**

It feels a little surreal to be writing this in late 2022, but the CJ McCollum situation with the Blazers is *still* hanging over everything. You remember the buzz, right? Everyone was throwing around names – McCollum to Philly, a potential package for Harden. Honestly, watching Damian Lillard be consistently linked to the Sixers just felt… unsettling. 

Portland was clearly in a rebuild, and the pressure on Lillard to carry the team was immense.  It’s a tough spot for any superstar, and you can’t help but wonder if a change of scenery would have benefited everyone.  Was it the right move for Dame?  For the Blazers?  It’s a debate that’s likely to rage on for years to come.
