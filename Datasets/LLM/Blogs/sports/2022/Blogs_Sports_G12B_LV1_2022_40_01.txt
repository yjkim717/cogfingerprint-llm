## That One Perfect Swing (and Why It Still Sticks With Me)

It's funny how a single moment in sports can just…linger. I've been playing golf sporadically for years, mostly just for the fresh air and a bit of friendly competition. I’m definitely no pro, more like a persistent amateur. But last August, something pretty special happened on the 8th hole at Willow Creek.

It was a par-3, maybe 140 yards out. I teed off, took a smooth swing with my trusty 5 iron, and *thwack*. The ball launched, a perfect arc against the clear blue sky, landing just a few feet from the pin. Honestly, I barely breathed until it settled. 

Then, the easy putt. Tapped it in. Birdie! Only my second ever, I think. The feeling was incredible - a rush of satisfaction and pure, unexpected joy. 

The rest of the round? Not so great. A few shanks, some missed putts, the usual. But that one shot? It’s stuck with me. A reminder that even when you’re battling inconsistency, you're capable of moments of brilliance. It’s a little slice of golfing sunshine from a pretty good summer in 2022.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
