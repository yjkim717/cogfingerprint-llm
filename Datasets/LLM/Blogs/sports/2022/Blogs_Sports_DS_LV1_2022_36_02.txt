It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through NBA news when a quirky thought hits me: what if every team’s arena was suddenly relocated 69 miles north? The idea started as a joke, but it quickly spiraled into something more. I began sketching out hypothetical new team names based on geography—like the "Milwaukee Timberwolves" or the "Miami Jaguars"—and I couldn’t stop laughing.

But then, I paused. In a year where real-world issues dominated sports headlines, this playful exercise reminded me why I love fandom: it’s an escape, a chance to find joy in the absurd. Renaming teams based on latitude felt like a love letter to the quirks that make each franchise unique, even when the world outside feels heavy.

Sometimes, the simplest ideas—like moving arenas on a map—reconnect us to the childlike wonder that drew us to sports in the first place. And honestly, we could all use a little more of that.
