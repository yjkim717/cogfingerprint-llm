As I laced up my running shoes this weekend, I couldn't help but think about the miles I've logged on my usual parkrun route. The crisp 2022 autumn air invigorated me, and I felt grateful for the opportunity to get outside and move. It's moments like these that make me love running even more. I was thrilled to see so many amazing running photos shared on our 'Photo Friday' feature - a great way to get inspiration from fellow runners! The winners of last week's photo contest stole the show with their stunning race photos. If you're looking for a boost to get you out on your running route, I encourage you to share your own running photos with us. Not only will you be showcasing your unique perspective, but you'll also be part of a vibrant community that celebrates the joy of running. So, grab your camera and get snapping!
