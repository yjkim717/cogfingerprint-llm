Even in 2022, my NCAA 14 Online Dynasty is my happy place. But I’ve hit a wall. My offensive coordinator is stuck at Level 0, refusing to gain any XP no matter what we do. And my aggressive recruiting? I’m getting hit with a major penalty for too many instacommits. It’s a bizarre, frustrating puzzle in a game I thought I’d mastered. Sometimes, the oldest games throw the newest curveballs, forcing you to adapt and learn all over again.
