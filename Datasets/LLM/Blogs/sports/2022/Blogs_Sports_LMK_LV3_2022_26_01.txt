As I watched Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's post-game interview in 2022, I was struck by his improved English fluency. It was a testament to his dedication to off-court growth. Effective communication is just as crucial as on-court skills in the NBA. Shai's progress is a great example of how hard work and perseverance can lead to success, both personally and professionally, making him a more well-rounded basketball player.
