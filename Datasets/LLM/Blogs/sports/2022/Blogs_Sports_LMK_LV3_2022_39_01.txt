"My Experiment with Preseason Training: A Reflection"

As I wrapped up my preseason training in the summer of 2022, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between cultivating mycelium and preparing for a sports season. Just as a mushroom grower nurtures liquid cultures to ensure their viability, I carefully planned my preseason regimen to optimize my performance. I stored my training data, much like a mycelium storage log, tracking my progress and noting the congregation of my efforts - long runs, strength training, and rest days. After a year and a half of experimenting with different routines, I observed significant differences in my endurance and agility. I'd love to hear from fellow athletes: what preseason strategies have worked for you? How do you store and review your training data to inform your next season's plan? Sharing our experiences can help us all grow stronger, just like a thriving mycelium network.
