**Lost in the Crowd – A Little League Lesson**

It was 2022, and my son, Leo, was finally playing in his first Little League game. The energy was electric, but honestly, it was overwhelming. So many parents, so much yelling, and a real feeling of everyone just wanting to *win*.  Leo, completely focused on his position, just quietly played his heart out.  It hit me then – sometimes, the biggest impact isn’t about dominating the crowd, but about showing up and doing your best, quietly and respectfully.  A valuable lesson, really.
