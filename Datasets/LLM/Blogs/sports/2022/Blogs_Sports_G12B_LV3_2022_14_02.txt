## A Little Flair Goes a Long Way

Isn't it amazing how something small can spark so much community? I stumbled upon the KC Roos subreddit recently and was charmed to see they've added user flairs representing rival Summit League teams, plus some seriously cool throwback designs. Even a special shout-out to Wichita State! It's a fun, lighthearted way to show team pride and build connections â€“ proving that even online, sports fandom can be surprisingly friendly.
