As I watched surfers ride the waves at Napili Bay in 2022, I couldn't help but think about the true spirit of aloha. Some tourists seemed to forget that they're guests in someone else's backyard, disrespecting local customs and ruining the experience for others. It's a valuable lesson for all of us - whether we're traveling or playing sports - to respect the culture and community that welcomes us.
