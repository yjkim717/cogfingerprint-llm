It’s funny how, in the thick of the 2022 NFL season, every loss feels like the end of the world. Your team drops a heartbreaker in Week 10, and it’s all doom and gloom in the group chat. But looking back, I’ve started thinking about a different kind of loss—the kind that stings in a strangely honorable way.

I recently read an analysis of how many times each NFL franchise has been knocked out of the playoffs by the team that went on to win the Super Bowl. It reframed everything. That gut-wrenching playoff exit? It wasn’t a failure; it was a collision with destiny. Your team didn’t lose to just anyone—they fell to the eventual champion. There’s a quiet dignity in that. It means they were one of the final obstacles on someone else’s path to glory, that they were playing at a level where only the absolute best could beat them.

It makes me appreciate the journey more. Sometimes, the story isn’t about winning it all. Sometimes, it’s about being a crucial part of someone else’s story—and knowing you were right there, in the thick of the fight, until the very end.
