There’s something about Klay Thompson that just tugs at the heartstrings. Watching him work his way back onto the court after those brutal, back-to-back injuries felt like a shared victory for all of us who love the game. It’s why, heading into the 2022 fantasy basketball season, I find myself in a real internal debate.

On one hand, the analyst in me sees the red flags. The minutes restriction, the occasional rust, the high ADP that feels more like a tribute to past glory than current production. It’s a risky pick, no doubt.

But the fan in me? The fan remembers the explosions, the effortless threes, the sheer joy he plays with. That part of me whispers, "What if?" What if this is the year he truly rounds back into form? What if his current lower value makes him the ultimate buy-low candidate, a steal that could win you your league?

It’s a gamble, for sure. But sometimes, the most rewarding fantasy picks aren't just about the stats; they're about the story. And betting on Klay feels like betting on a comeback we all want to see happen.
