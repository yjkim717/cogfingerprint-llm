The whistle blew, and just like that, my final high school soccer season was over in 2022. Standing there in the mud, catching my breath, it wasn't the championship loss that hit me hardest. It was the realization that this structured part of my life—the practices, the bus rides, the pre-game rituals with my team—was finished.

For over a decade, my identity was tied to the field. Now what? I felt a little untethered, like a boat without a mooring. But in that quiet moment after the crowd's roar faded, a new thought emerged. This isn't an ending; it's the start of playing for myself. No more drills, just the pure joy of a kick-about with friends. The competition was over, but my love for the game was just beginning a new, freer chapter.
