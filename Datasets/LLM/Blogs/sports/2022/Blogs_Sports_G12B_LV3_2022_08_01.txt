## Something Feels Different About This Michigan Team

Okay, folks, has anyone else noticed something a little… different about the Michigan Wolverines this year? Specifically, their redzone efficiency lately has been *chef’s kiss*. It got me thinking – is this just a hot streak, or is Jim Harbaugh and his staff playing a long game? A Reddit thread I stumbled upon really hit the nail on the head: are they strategically holding back their best stuff, unleashing it in the late season when it *really* matters? It feels like a calculated move, and honestly, it’s pretty exciting to watch unfold. Touchdowns when you need them? Yes, please!
