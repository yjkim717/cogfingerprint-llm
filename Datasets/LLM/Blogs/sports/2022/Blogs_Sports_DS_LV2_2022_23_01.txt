The crisp autumn air always brings back that familiar hum of anticipation—the buzz of college football Saturdays. But this year, something’s missing in the heart of El Assico. I can’t help but feel a pang of nostalgia thinking about the Hawkeye and ISU bands, whose absence on the road speaks volumes.

It’s in those shared traditions—the booming drums, the synchronized steps—that rivalries truly come alive. Without them, the stadium feels a little quieter, the energy a notch dimmer. We fans carry the spirit, but it’s the bands that weave the soundtrack to our memories. Here’s hoping future seasons restore that harmony, because football isn’t just played; it’s felt, together.
