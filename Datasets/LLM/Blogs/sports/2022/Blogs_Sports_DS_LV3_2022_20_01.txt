The final buzzer of my senior year basketball season echoed in 2022, and in my digital cleanup, I accidentally deleted the entire season's highlight reel from my phone. It was like losing the trophy all over again. Those clips weren't just videos; they were our last-second shots, our locker room celebrations, the proof of our growth. That sinking feeling is a unique kind of loss. It’s not just data; it’s a piece of your story, suddenly gone, leaving behind a hollow, silent gallery where memories used to play.
