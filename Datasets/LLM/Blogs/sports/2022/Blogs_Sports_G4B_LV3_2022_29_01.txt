**That Unexpected Rush**

I just got back from a weekend at the local soccer fields – and wow, it was *packed*.  I’d pictured a few families, a mellow vibe. Instead, it was a full-on explosion of kids, parents, and coaches.  It reminded me of Napili Bay – unexpectedly busy, even in the off-season.  Sometimes, you crave quiet, but there’s a certain energy to seeing so many people, so many faces, all chasing a shared goal. It’s a good reminder to embrace the chaos sometimes!
