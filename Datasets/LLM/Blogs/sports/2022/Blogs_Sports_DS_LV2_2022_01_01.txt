The roar of the stadium was electric, a sound I’d only ever experienced through my TV. But in 2022, there I was, lacing up my cleats for my son’s first high school championship game. It wasn't about winning; it was about the shared, nervous energy in the crisp autumn air. Watching him on that field, I didn’t just see a player—I saw all those backyard practices, the scraped knees, and the unwavering passion. It reminded me that the real victory isn't the final score, but the heart you discover on the journey. Sometimes, the most profound moments happen just off the sidelines.
