**The Longest Timeout**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Being a spectator can feel just as intense as being *in* the game. Last fall, watching my niece play high school soccer – a nail-biting semi-final – really hit me.  She was battling a terrible ankle injury, and the coach called a timeout, not just for the team, but for her. 

It made me think about those moments where you’re staring at a YouTube replay of someone’s epic Xbox gameplay, or watching a Twitch streamer’s frantic game chat.  Sometimes, the best strategy isn’t about speed or wins, but about knowing when to pause and just *be* part of the experience.
