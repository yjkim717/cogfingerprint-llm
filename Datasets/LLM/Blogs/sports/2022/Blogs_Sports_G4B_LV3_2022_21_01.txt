**The Poll Said… And I Have to Admit, I Was Surprised**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How quickly opinions can shift in the world of college football? I saw a Reddit poll pop up the other day – the /r/CFB one – and it was fascinating. Alabama and Ohio State were dominating the top two spots, which, honestly, felt a little unexpected heading into Week 6 of the 2022 season. 

Georgia and Clemson were right behind them, of course – you just *know* they’re contenders. It made me think about how much our own biases and recent results influence what we believe. I’ve been a die-hard Georgia fan for years, so naturally, I leaned that way. But seeing that poll… it was a good reminder to step back and really assess the talent and momentum of *all* the teams.  What do *you* think, who’s really got a shot this year?
