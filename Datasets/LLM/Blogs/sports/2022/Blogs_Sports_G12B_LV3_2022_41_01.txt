>## Does Anyone *Really* Know Anything About College Football? (A Look Back at the 2022 AP Poll)

Remember the chaos of the 2022 college football season? Week to week, it felt like anything could happen, and it usually did! I got completely sucked in, as I always do, obsessively checking the AP Poll every Sunday. But this year, I started wondering… do these voters *really* know what they're doing? 

I stumbled across some fascinating analysis actually visualizing the AP Poll ballots throughout the season. It turns out, there was a surprising amount of disagreement! Some voters were all over the place, while others stuck pretty closely to the consensus. It was wild to see how different everyone’s rankings were, especially in those early weeks.

What struck me most? The diversity of those early ballots was actually a *good* thing. It allowed for more teams to get a shot at the spotlight, and honestly, made the season even more unpredictable and exciting. Maybe we should embrace the chaos a little more! It’s a reminder that even in a world striving for data and analytics, a little bit of subjective opinion can make things a whole lot more interesting.
