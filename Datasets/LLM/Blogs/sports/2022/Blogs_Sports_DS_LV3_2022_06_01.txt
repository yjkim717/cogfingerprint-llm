It’s 2022, and I keep thinking about Ben Simmons. Everyone’s so focused on his lack of a jump shot—but honestly, that’s not what’s holding him back. I’ve watched those playoff games where he seemed to disappear, almost afraid of the moment. The real issue isn't on the perimeter; it’s at the free-throw line and in his hesitation to attack the rim with force. If he could just find that aggression when it matters most and knock down his free throws, he’d be a game-changer, even without a reliable shot. It’s a lesson in confronting the pressure, not just the criticism.
