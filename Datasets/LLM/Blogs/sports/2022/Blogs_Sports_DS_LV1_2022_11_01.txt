Remember that weird, transitional phase of puberty where your interests were a bizarre cocktail of history class and pop culture? I was just on Reddit, and a thread about lifelong celebrity crushes took me right back. People were listing their Mount Rushmores of celebrity infatuations, and it got me thinking about my own from the world of sports media.

My list would be incomplete without a nod to Bill Simmons. Back in 2022, as his podcast empire was in full swing, his name was everywhere. He had this unique talent for blending deep sports analysis with pure, unadulterated fan passion. Listening to him wasn't just about getting takes; it was about feeling connected to the game on a gut level. That kind of authentic, lasting voice is the real crush—not on a person, but on the way they make you love the sport even more. It’s a loyalty that goes deeper than any fleeting highlight.
