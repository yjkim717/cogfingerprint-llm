It’s 2020, and I keep thinking about Bill Simmons and SVP. Both giants in sports media, both deep into the gambling conversation, and both tight with Ryen Russilo. So why haven’t we gotten that epic podcast crossover? It feels like the sports world’s version of a Marvel team-up that never happens. Maybe it’s just scheduling, or maybe some unspoken rivalry. Either way, in a year full of uncertainties, this is one sports mystery I’d love to see solved.
