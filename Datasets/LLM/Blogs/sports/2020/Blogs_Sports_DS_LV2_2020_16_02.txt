You know, in a year where nothing has gone according to plan, maybe it’s fitting that the Fulmer Cup—college football’s infamous award for off-field mischief—is getting a split season, too. Two champions for 2020. It’s almost poetic.

It feels like the universe is reminding us that even in chaos, there’s room for a little absurdity. While conferences debated whether to play, and athletes faced uncertainty we can’t fully grasp, the Fulmer Cup quietly adapted. No fuss, no drama—just a simple acknowledgment that this year is different.

And isn’t that something? In a season stripped of tailgates and packed stadiums, a trophy for offseason antics finds a way to mirror our reality. It’s strangely comforting. It tells me that no matter how divided or disjointed things feel, our traditions—even the quirky, slightly embarrassing ones—find a way to endure. Here’s to the unexpected silver linings, and the champions, however they’re crowned.
