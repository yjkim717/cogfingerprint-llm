It’s weird, isn’t it? Looking back at 2020, a year that felt like a collective holding of breath, and suddenly remembering how obsessed we were with football rankings. Specifically, the *NFL* power rankings. 

I spent a ridiculous amount of time scrolling through ESPN, CBS, and even diving into the chaotic world of Reddit NFL threads. Seriously, the debates were *intense*. Everyone had an opinion, a carefully constructed argument based on a single bad play or a surprisingly good win. 

It felt… heightened. Maybe it was the constant uncertainty of the season – the COVID protocols, the shifting schedules – that made the rankings feel so crucial. They weren’t just about who was winning; they were a way to try and make sense of everything. 

I remember specifically getting frustrated with one particular ranking – I’m not going to name names! – that had the [Insert a team you remember being ranked surprisingly high or low] sitting comfortably in the top five. It just *felt* wrong. 

Looking back, though, I realize it wasn't really about the numbers. It was about the shared experience, the collective hope that our favorite team could somehow rise to the top. 2020 was a year of unexpected turns, and the NFL rankings were just one small, slightly obsessive, reflection of that wild ride.
