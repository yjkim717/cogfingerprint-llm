Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone, referencing the 2020 context, and incorporating the keywords subtly. It leans into the feeling of uncertainty and disruption that defined that year.  I've included some notes at the bottom about potential further refinement.

## The Ghost of March Madness and a Whole Lot of Questions

Remember March? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? 2020… a year that redefined "unprecedented." We all know *what* happened – the shutdowns, the masks, the isolation. But I think what still sticks with me, beyond all the larger anxieties, is the sudden, jarring halt to the sports we rely on. Specifically, the abrupt end to the college basketball season.

I was genuinely bummed. Not because I’m a die-hard fan of any particular team (though I do have a soft spot for a good underdog story), but because March Madness felt like… a constant. A reliable burst of joyful chaos in a world that increasingly felt anything but. It was a shared experience, wasn’t it? Huddling around TVs with friends, the office bracket pools buzzing with nervous energy, the sheer thrill of the unexpected upset.

That year, the buzz was particularly interesting. Everyone was talking about Cade Cunningham and the potential he brought to the landscape. The Big 12 felt like it was poised for a really good season. Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma… they were all looking strong.  But it all just… vanished. Poof. Like a dream.

It’s funny the things you miss when they’re gone. It wasn’t just the games themselves. It was the *feeling* of them. The collective anticipation, the shared disappointment, the water cooler conversations the next day dissecting every play. It was a ritual, a comfort. And suddenly, that ritual was ripped away.

2020 forced us to confront a lot of uncomfortable truths, about our priorities, our connections, and the fragility of… well, everything. And I think, in a small way, the absence of March Madness highlighted that fragility. It underscored how much we rely on these seemingly insignificant things to ground us, to give us a sense of normalcy and community.

Now, looking back, it’s a little surreal. We’ve adjusted, haven’t we? We’ve found new routines, new ways to connect. And sports have returned, albeit with a different flavor. But I still find myself thinking about that ghost of March Madness, that season that never truly was. It serves as a reminder of the unexpected, a lesson in appreciating the moments we have, and a quiet hope that next year, things will feel a little more… predictable. A little more *normal*. And maybe, just maybe, we'll get to fill out those brackets with a sense of genuine excitement again.

What about you? What did you miss most when sports disappeared in 2020? Let me know in the comments.
