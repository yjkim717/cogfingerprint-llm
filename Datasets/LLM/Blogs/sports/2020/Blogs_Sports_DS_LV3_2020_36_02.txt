The roar of the stadiums was gone, replaced by an eerie silence. In 2020, my passion for sports felt like a ghost. With live events canceled, I turned my restless energy to the stock market, eyeing battered airline stocks like JetBlue. If teams could make a comeback, why not the entire travel industry? I imagined a roaring recovery, pouring savings in, convinced I was buying at the bottom. It felt like a gamble, a high-stakes game without a playbook. I was betting on a world I desperately wanted backâ€”one filled with the familiar sounds of jets overhead and crowds cheering.
