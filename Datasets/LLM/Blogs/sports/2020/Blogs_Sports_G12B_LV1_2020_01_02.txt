>## The Empty Stands and the Unexpected Lesson

2020. The year that felt like it stole everything, didn't it? For me, a huge part of that was the silence at the local baseball field. My son, Leo, had just started playing Little League, and I was fully prepared to be *that* parent – the one yelling encouragement from the sidelines, meticulously tracking stats, and generally living vicariously through his baseball dreams. 

Then, everything shut down. Games were cancelled. Practices were postponed. The vibrant energy of the field vanished. 

It felt like a huge disappointment, especially for Leo. But something unexpected happened. We started just *playing* catch in the backyard. No scorekeeping, no pressure, just throwing the ball back and forth, talking about his favorite Pokémon (Gengar was always a winner!). 

It reminded me that the joy wasn't really about winning or losing, or even the thrill of the game itself. It was about connection – the bond with my son, the shared laughter, the simple act of doing something together. And sometimes, the best lessons are learned in the quietest of moments, even in the face of an empty stadium.
