"Revving up my T300RS GT was a thrill in 2020, until my servo motor gave up on me. As a sim racing enthusiast, I was determined to get back on track. I began researching a replacement motor, considering compatibility with alternatives. After some trial and error, I found a suitable substitute. Now, my wheel is back to delivering a smooth, immersive experience. The hunt for the perfect motor was a journey, but it was worth it to get back to racing."
