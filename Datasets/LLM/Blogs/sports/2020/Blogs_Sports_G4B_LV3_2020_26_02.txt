It’s still tough to think about the 2020 Thunder season. That sudden, jarring end – just when you thought they were really starting to gel. I remember feeling a real sense of frustration, like we were only seeing a glimpse of what they *could* have achieved.  A full regular season would have undoubtedly blown away their previous win total. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most exciting stories are cut short.
