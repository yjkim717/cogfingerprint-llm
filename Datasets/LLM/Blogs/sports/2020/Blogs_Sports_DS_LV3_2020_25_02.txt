I’ll never forget that 2020 season—the empty stadiums, the eerie silence before each game. It felt like facing a flock of intimidating birds, just like that Calvin and Hobbes quote about fear making things seem bigger than they are. Without the roar of the crowd, every play was a quiet battle with doubt. But in that stillness, I found a new kind of focus, a personal victory over the noise we’d all come to rely on.
