**The Spreadsheet and the Dream**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2020, with the world feeling so uncertain, I found myself utterly consumed by a spreadsheet. A fantasy football one, to be precise. Specifically, I was obsessing over player valuations for FPL – the Premier League game – and trying to predict prices. 

It felt… grounding, actually. Like a tiny, manageable challenge in a year of colossal shifts. I spent hours poring over stats, arguing with friends about whether to gamble on a young striker.  It wasn’t about winning, really. It was about that shared excitement, that hopeful anticipation of what *could* be.  A little bit of playful prediction felt like a small victory against the chaos.  Who knew a digital league could offer such a focus?
