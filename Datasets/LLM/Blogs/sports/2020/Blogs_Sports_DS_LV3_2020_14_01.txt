The air in the gyms feels different this year. It’s 2020, and if there’s one thing we’ve all learned, it’s that nothing is a given. No season, no game, no buzzer-beater. And as I look at the Big 12 conference, that feeling is everywhere—a strange cocktail of hope, anxiety, and a healthy dose of sarcasm to keep us all from taking it too seriously.

I remember the buzz around the recruits last spring. We were dissecting highlight reels of high school phenoms, talking about these kids like they were mythical figures destined to carry programs to the promised land of the NCAA tournament. Now, as we stare down the barrel of a preseason like no other, it all feels a little more… human. These aren't just prospects; they're young adults stepping into a world turned upside down, expected to perform while the rest of us watch from our couches.

Take the Kansas Jayhawks, for instance. On paper, they’re a powerhouse, a team built for a deep March run. But this year, "on paper" feels flimsy. What happens when a key player has to quarantine? What happens when the roar of Allen Fieldhouse is replaced by cardboard cutouts? It’s the same story up and down the conference. You look at Baylor’s gritty defense or Texas’s explosive backcourt, and you can’t help but feel a twinge of "what if?" What if this is the year it all comes together? Or what if it’s the year it all falls spectacularly apart?

My own relationship with this season is different, too. I’m not just a fan analyzing stats anymore. I’m a person clinging to the normalcy of a jump shot, the familiar rhythm of a fast break. In a year where so much has been stripped away, this preseason isn’t just about rankings or predictions. It’s a reminder of the sheer, stubborn joy of the game itself. The wins will feel sweeter, the losses will sting differently, and the journey to the tournament will be the most unpredictable one we’ve ever witnessed. So here’s to the Big 12 in 2020. May your three-pointers fall, your defenses hold, and may we all remember to laugh a little along the way. Because if this year has taught us anything, it’s that you have to.
