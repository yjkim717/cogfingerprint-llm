## The Unexpected Lesson from My Son's Baseball Obsession (and a Pandemic Year)

2020 was… a lot, right? For us, a huge chunk of it revolved around my six-year-old and his sudden, all-consuming love of baseball. He'd spend hours practicing his swing in the backyard, mimicking his heroes. It wasn't about winning, though. It was the *process* – the focus, the repetition, the quiet determination. 

Watching him, I realized I'd forgotten that joy. Somewhere along the way, sports became about competition and pressure, losing sight of the simple pleasure of just *doing*. My son reminded me that sometimes, the best victories aren't on a scoreboard, but in the dedication we bring to something we love. It was a powerful lesson, delivered perfectly by a little slugger during a year that demanded a lot of patience and perspective.
