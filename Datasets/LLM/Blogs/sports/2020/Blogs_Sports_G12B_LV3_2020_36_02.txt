## The Empty Stands and a Glimmer of Hope

Remember the hush? 2020 felt defined by it – the sudden, unsettling silence where roaring crowds used to be. As a lifelong sports fan, the empty stadiums were jarring. Baseball, football, basketball… it felt like a piece of the experience was fundamentally missing. 

Like a lot of people, I found myself searching for something to hold onto amidst the uncertainty. And, oddly enough, it led me to thinking about investing. Seeing how sports teams and leagues were struggling, I started wondering if there were opportunities. Could a rebound be coming? 

It’s a risky game, just like any investment, and I'm no financial expert. But the thought of supporting the teams I love while potentially seeing a return felt… right. It’s a long shot, sure, but maybe, just maybe, this pause will lead to a stronger, more resilient future for the games we all cherish. What about you? Did the strange quiet of 2020 shift your perspective on anything?
