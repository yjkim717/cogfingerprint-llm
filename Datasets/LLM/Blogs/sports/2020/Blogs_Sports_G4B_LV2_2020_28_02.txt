**The Unexpected Playbook**

2020 felt like a constant curveball, didn’t it? Like a game where the rules kept changing mid-season. I was a pretty decent amateur baseball player – mostly a catcher – and I thrive on strategy, on knowing the next pitch. But this year, there *was* no playbook. 

It mirrored what I’ve been seeing in the nonprofit world – specifically, building a new fundraising program. Like a team without a clear strategy, it felt chaotic. I realized I needed to develop new skills, get certified in best practices, and really understand planned giving. 

Just like a catcher needs to anticipate the throw, I needed to anticipate donor needs. It’s about learning the game, adapting, and finding a way to make a solid play, even when things are unpredictable.  Anyone else feel like they had to rewrite their game plan this year?
