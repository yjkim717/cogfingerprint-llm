**Title: The Lost Art of the Voicemail**

We’ve all been there: you listen to a voicemail, and the person rattles off their **phone number** at lightning speed. You fumble for a pen, rewind, and pray you caught it right the second time.

In our rush, we create more work. The simple act of slowing down when you leave your contact information—especially on a **voicemail**—is a gift of clarity. If you want to avoid that awkward callback where someone has to ask you to **repeat** yourself, just **slow down**. Enunciate each digit. Pause after the area code. If you have an **extension**, state it clearly. A few seconds of patience on your end saves everyone time and frustration. It’s a small courtesy that speaks volumes.

**The Empty Stadium**

2020 was the year the roar fell silent. I remember watching a playoff game from an empty stadium, the hollow echo of a dribble replacing the thunder of a crowd. It was surreal, like a practice scrimmage with a billion viewers.

But in that quiet, something shifted. I started hearing the game itself—the players' shouts, the squeak of sneakers, the raw emotion in a voice after a score. It stripped sports down to its essence, reminding me why I fell in love with it in the first place. Not for the spectacle, but for the pure, beautiful struggle playing out on the court.
