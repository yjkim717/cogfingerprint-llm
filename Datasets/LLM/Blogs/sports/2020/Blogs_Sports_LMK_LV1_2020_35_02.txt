"It's time for another Photo Friday! I'm still grinning thinking about last week's winners - congrats again to Sarah and Mike on their awesome running route snaps! As we settle into the new normal of 2020, I'm loving seeing all your running photos popping up on social media. Keep 'em coming! Whether you're training for a virtual race or just logging some solo miles, I want to see your photos. Share your race day highlights, your scenic route faves, or just a fun moment with your fellow runners. Tag me and you might just see yourself featured here next Friday!"
