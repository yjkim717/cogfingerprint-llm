### The Race Photo That Wasn't

You know the race photo I’m talking about. The one where you’re mid-stride, face locked in a grimace that’s equal parts pain and determination. For years, I’d cringe at mine, deleting them instantly.

Then 2020 happened. Races vanished, and my running became solitary loops around my neighborhood. My "finish lines" were my own driveway. On a whim one Friday, I shared a simple picture of my favorite quiet street at dawn, the pavement still dark from the night’s rain.

The upvotes and comments flooded in. "That's my route too!" and "Beautiful light!" It hit me then. The perfect race photo isn't about a polished finish-line smile; it’s about the story of the run itself. It’s the raw, real moments on the routes that keep us moving, even when no one is watching. My camera roll is now full of them, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
