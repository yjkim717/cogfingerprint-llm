If there’s one thing 2020 taught us, it’s that nothing is set in stone—not even college football. I remember the uncertainty hanging over every kickoff, every practice, as conferences scrambled and seasons were postponed. It felt like the game we loved was being rewritten in real time.

That’s why hearing about the Fulmer Cup’s split-season update hit home for me. Instead of clinging to tradition, they adapted—creating two separate competitions: one for teams playing in the fall, and another for those waiting in the wings. It wasn’t just a rule change; it felt like a quiet nod to resilience. In a year that asked so much of players and fans, this flexible approach meant every team still had a shot at being champions, on their own terms.

It reminded me that sometimes, the real victory isn’t in sticking to the plan, but in having the courage to redraw the map when the old one no longer fits. Here’s to the champions—wherever and whenever they earned it.
