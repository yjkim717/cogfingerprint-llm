## That Feeling of *Finally* Getting It

Remember that weird, collective energy of 2020? Everything felt… different. I found myself obsessively playing Sporcle quizzes – a harmless distraction. There was one type I loved: the "minefield" quizzes. You know, the ones where one wrong click and you’re done.  It struck me the other day: wouldn't it be more satisfying if badges only tracked your *first* successful run? That initial surge of triumph, that sheer relief... that’s the moment worth celebrating, right? It felt like so many games in 2020 – finally figuring out a new routine, a new normal.
