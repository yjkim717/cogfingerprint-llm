**The Unexpected Curveball in the Season**

2020. It felt like a year of constant curveballs, didn’t it? I was really looking forward to finally upgrading my old pickup – a reliable workhorse, but showing its age. I’d secured pre-approval from Bank of America, a huge weight off my mind. Then, I started visiting dealerships, excited to drive off with a new Subaru. 

But here’s where it got frustrating. Instead of moving forward with my pre-approval, each dealer insisted on running their *own* credit check. It felt like a deliberate roadblock, a frustrating detour from the simple path I’d planned. 

It made me think about sports – a good team captain anticipates those unexpected plays, adjusts their strategy. Buying a car shouldn’t feel like that. It’s supposed to be a straightforward process.  Maybe I should have researched local dealerships more thoroughly before settling on my initial choice.  It’s a reminder that even in the simplest transactions, a little preparation can save you a whole lot of frustration.
