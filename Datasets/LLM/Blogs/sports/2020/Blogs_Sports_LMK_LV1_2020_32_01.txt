The 2020 Canadian university football season - a tale of cancelled games, disappointed fans, and a lingering debate about the future of U Sports. As a long-time follower of the sport, I'm still grappling with the implications of the cancellation and the rules that led to it.

For those unfamiliar, U Sports is Canada's equivalent of the NCAA in the States. It's the governing body for university athletics, and its age cap and eligibility rules are designed to ensure that student-athletes are, well, students first. The rules dictate that athletes can't be older than 25 by a certain date, and that they have to be enrolled in a university program to be eligible to compete.

On the surface, these rules make sense. They aim to maintain a level playing field and prioritize the student-athlete experience. However, as the 2020 season cancellation highlighted, they can also have unintended consequences. With the COVID-19 pandemic raging, U Sports made the difficult decision to axe the football season altogether. While safety concerns were undoubtedly the primary motivator, the move also raised questions about the age cap and eligibility rules.

Many argued that the rules unfairly penalized athletes who had spent years developing their skills, only to have their university careers cut short by the pandemic. Some had already surpassed the age cap, while others were forced to choose between pursuing their athletic dreams and continuing their education. It was a tough pill to swallow, especially for those who had dedicated themselves to their sport.

As I reflect on the controversy, I'm struck by the complexity of the issue. On one hand, the rules are in place to protect the integrity of the game and ensure that student-athletes are, indeed, students. On the other hand, they can be inflexible and fail to account for exceptional circumstances. The pandemic, for instance, was a once-in-a-lifetime event that threw a wrench into the plans of many athletes.

As the dust settles, it's clear that the debate surrounding U Sports' age cap and eligibility rules is far from over. While the cancellation of the 2020 season was a difficult decision, it has sparked a necessary conversation about the future of Canadian university football. As we move forward, it's essential that we strike a balance between preserving the spirit of the game and being responsive to the needs of student-athletes. Only time will tell if U Sports will revisit its rules, but one thing is certain - the conversation has only just begun.
