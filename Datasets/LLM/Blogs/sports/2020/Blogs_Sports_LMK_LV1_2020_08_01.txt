"Throwback to the '94 Eagles: A Season of What-Ifs. It's 2020 and I'm still haunted by the 1994 Philadelphia Eagles' collapse. After dominating the NFC with a 7-2 start, they inexplicably fell apart, losing six of their last seven games. The NFL playoffs slipped away, and with it, a chance at Super Bowl glory. As a die-hard Eagles fan, it's still hard to fathom what could've been. The memories of that season's highs and lows remain vivid, a cautionary tale of how quickly success can turn to heartbreak."
