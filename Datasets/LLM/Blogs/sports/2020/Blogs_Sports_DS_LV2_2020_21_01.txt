Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

There’s a strange comfort in the familiar, isn’t there? In a year where absolutely nothing felt certain, from our daily routines to the very rhythm of the seasons, I found myself clinging to the small things. For me, one of those anchors was the weekly ritual of checking the /r/CFB poll.

Seeing Alabama, Notre Dame, and Ohio State holding firm at the top this week was like a deep, steadying breath. In the chaos of 2020, with stadiums feeling more like ghost towns and the schedule a constantly shifting puzzle, these three names were a constant. They were a reminder that some foundations, no matter how battered, don't completely crumble.

It’s funny—I’m not even a die-hard fan of any of these teams. But in their consistent excellence, I found a narrative I desperately needed. It wasn't about the X's and O's, but about resilience. It was a testament that even when the world tilts on its axis, the pursuit of a goal, the drive to be the best, can still push through.

That poll became more than just rankings; it was a weekly postcard from a world I remembered. A small, stubborn echo of normalcy in a year that was anything but. And for a few moments every week, that was enough.
