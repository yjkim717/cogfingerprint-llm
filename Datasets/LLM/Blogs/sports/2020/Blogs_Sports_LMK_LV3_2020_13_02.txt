As an online store owner selling university shirts, I never thought I'd be stressing about international sales tax - until I made a one-time sale to Canada in 2020. Suddenly, I was hit with the reality of navigating cross-border sales and ecommerce sales tax implications. It was overwhelming, to say the least. I had to consider whether I was obligated to collect and remit sales tax on that Canadian sale. It made me realize that as an ecommerce business, you're not just selling to local fans cheering on their team; you're part of a global community. This experience taught me that understanding sales tax rules for international transactions is crucial to avoiding unexpected costs and ensuring compliance. It was a valuable lesson in the complexities of global ecommerce, and one that I'll carry with me as I continue to grow my online store.
