### The Game That Wasn't

I remember the silence most of all. In March of 2020, the stadiums didn't just go quiet; they became hollow. No squeak of sneakers, no roar of a game-winning shot, just the eerie echo of a world on pause.

My ritual was gone. No more gathering with friends, dissecting plays, or feeling that collective gasp of a crowd. At first, it felt like a loss. But in that forced stillness, I found something else. I started shooting hoops alone in my driveway, the rhythmic thump of the ball a kind of meditation. I realized the heart of sports wasn't in the massive arenas or the highlight reels. It was in that simple, personal joyâ€”the feel of the ball in your hands, the satisfaction of a clean shot.

When the games finally returned in their strange, fan-less bubbles, I watched with a new appreciation. I wasn't just watching for the score; I was celebrating the sheer, stubborn resilience of play itself. We learned that year that the spirit of the game isn't in the stands; it's in us, waiting for its chance to bounce back.
