## Did My Obsession Ruin My Season? (And Maybe My Gear?)

Okay, so this might sound a little…weird. But I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, and it's all tied back to a peculiar realization. Remember 2020? The year everything felt off-kilter? For me, that feeling extended to my fantasy football league.

I was *obsessed*. Seriously. Every morning, I'd be glued to injury reports, pouring over stats, making trades at 3 AM. I felt like I was doing everything right to build the ultimate team. But…we just weren’t clicking. We’d win a game, then lose the next in a baffling way. It was frustrating.

It got me thinking about something totally unrelated: my home stereo system. For years, I'd been winding my speaker cables *around* the binding posts, thinking it looked neat, a little more secure.  Then, I read something about potential issues – basically, a minor short circuit, a gradual strain. I'd had occasional fuse blows, which I just brushed off. 

Could my relentless focus, my over-optimization in one area (fantasy), have blinded me to a bigger picture? Did that seemingly minor, aesthetic choice with my cables contribute to a larger, underlying instability? I don’t know. It’s a strange parallel, but 2020 was a year of strange parallels, wasn't it? Maybe sometimes, the things we think are harmless are actually subtly undermining us.
