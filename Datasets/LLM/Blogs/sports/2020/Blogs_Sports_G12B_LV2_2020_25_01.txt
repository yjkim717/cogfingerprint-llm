## The Quiet of Empty Stadiums

Remember 2020? The world felt… muted. For me, that meant missing the roar of the stadium. I’m a lifelong baseball fan, and suddenly, those summer nights were silent. Watching games on TV just wasn't the same without the shared energy, the collective gasps, the feeling of being *there*. It was a strange, isolating experience, and honestly, it made me appreciate the simple joy of a crowded ballpark even more. Hoping for those days back soon!
