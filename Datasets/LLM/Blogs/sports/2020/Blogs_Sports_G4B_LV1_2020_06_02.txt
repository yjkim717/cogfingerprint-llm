**Is Christian Wood Getting a Raw Deal?**

Okay, so I’ve been watching the Rockets a lot lately, and it’s got me thinking about Christian Wood. Seriously, the guy is a *beast*.  His rebounding numbers are insane, his scoring explodes when he gets going – it's like he’s playing a completely different game than everyone else. 

But then you look at his salary, and it just feels…off. You see guys with similar production getting paid way more. It’s frustrating to watch a player with that kind of potential being held back, and it makes you wonder if the Rockets are truly valuing what he brings to the table. 

It's a reminder that sometimes, in the NBA, it’s not just about the highlights; it's about the whole package.  Do you think Wood is being overlooked? Let me know in the comments!
