### The Final Countdown: My Uninvited Third Trimester Companion

Well, here we are at 38 weeks. I thought I was prepared for the classic pregnancy symptoms: the heartburn, the backache, the general feeling of being a beached whale. But no one truly prepared me for the bladder pressure and its sneaky side effect—the unexpected little leaks.

I had my first real "uh-oh" moment last week, mid-laugh at a funny video. Let's just say my sweatpants got a little more than damp. My first reaction was pure panic. Was something wrong? Then, my midwife calmly explained it’s just the baby’s head putting significant pressure on my bladder. It’s not a malfunction; it’s simple, hilarious physics.

The game-changer for my anxiety? Acceptance. Fighting it just made me more stressed. So, I’ve embraced a new best friend: a trusty pack of Depends Silhouettes. It’s not a sign of defeat; it’s a strategic move. Now, I can laugh, sneeze, or even think about water without that jolt of fear. It’s one less thing to worry about in this wild, final stretch. To all the mamas-to-be out there, if this happens to you, know you're not alone. Sometimes, surrendering to the symptom is the ultimate form of self-care.
