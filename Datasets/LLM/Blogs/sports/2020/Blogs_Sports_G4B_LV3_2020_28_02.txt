**The Unexpected Playbook Change**

2020 threw a curveball at everyone, didn’t it? Like a sudden shift in a basketball game – you’re running your usual plays, and then *bam*, everything changes. For years, I’d been laser-focused on Annual Giving for my local youth soccer league – a comfortable, predictable strategy. But seeing the incredible need for skill development programs during the pandemic, and realizing we lacked the resources for a full overhaul, it felt like a different kind of challenge. 

It made me think about planned giving – building a sustainable future by securing long-term support. It’s a complex strategy, needing expertise, just like a winning team needs a diverse skillset.  Maybe it’s time to learn a new playbook, just like I'm starting to explore how to build a stronger foundation for the kids we serve.
