## The Missed Connection and the Echo of 2020

Remember that weird, isolating feeling of 2020? Everything felt muffled, slightly delayed. Even cheering for my favorite team, the Raptors, felt…distant. I was trying to coordinate a watch party with my college buddies, all scattered across the country. We were attempting to sync up for a crucial playoff game.

It was a chaotic string of texts and calls. One friend, bless his heart, left a voicemail with his number and extension. I distinctly remember listening to it, thinking, "Wait, what was that last digit?" I had to call him back *twice* to confirm. 

It struck me then – just like that voicemail, life in 2020 demanded clarity. We needed to slow down, repeat ourselves, make sure we were truly *connecting* amidst the noise. That missed connection, that frustrating repeat, became a small metaphor for everything else. We all just needed to be a little more deliberate, a little more patient, to hear each other clearly. And maybe, just maybe, catch the game.
