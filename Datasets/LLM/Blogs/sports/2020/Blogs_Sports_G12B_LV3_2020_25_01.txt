## The Game That Taught Me About Letting Go (and Maybe Salsa?)

Remember the bubble of 2020? Everything felt…contained. I was *so* fixated on my fantasy football team, chasing that championship. Then, a devastating loss in the final week. It stung. It really did. It made me realize holding on too tight can ruin the fun. Kind of like worrying about a jar of salsa past its "best by" date – sometimes you just gotta enjoy it while it's good, right? Let it go, and savor the moment.
