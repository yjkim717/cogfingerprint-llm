"Leveling Up My Fitness Game: A ProgressBar 95 Approach"

As I laced up my running shoes in early 2020, I couldn't help but think of the old ProgressBar 95 screensaver. You know, the one where the bar would slowly fill up, simulating a loading process? I had an epiphany - what if I applied that same concept to my fitness journey? Just like Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge navigate through the internet, I wanted to navigate through my workout routine with a similar sense of progression. I created a "Game Mode" for my exercise regimen, breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable chunks, like an internet atlas mapping out new territories. Each completed workout was a step closer to my goal, and with every "level" up, I felt like I was getting closer to my destination. It was a simple yet effective approach that kept me motivated throughout the year.
