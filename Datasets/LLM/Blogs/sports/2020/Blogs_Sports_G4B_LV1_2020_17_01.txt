**The Snoo & the Sudden Shift**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? And navigating parenthood on top of everything else felt like a monumental challenge. We’d gotten so used to the Snoo – honestly, those longer naps were a lifesaver! But then, little Leo started showing signs he was ready to ditch the swaddle, and the Snoo just felt… overkill. 

It was weirdly emotional, to be honest. Like, I was worried about disrupting his routine, about him being uncomfortable.  We started slowly, transitioning to a sleep sack, and there were some nights of frantic checking and a few tearful little faces.  But slowly, he’s mastering rolling over, and while the Snoo’s gone, those precious naps are still happening – just a little less technologically assisted. It’s a reminder that sometimes, letting go is the bravest thing you can do.
