That day at the driving range in 2020, my buddy’s advice hit home: “Forget the new driver; invest in lessons.” I was torn—should I book an instructor or just film my swing? I tried the video route first, but staring at my phone screen, I felt lost. The angles, the positions—it was just noise without context.

So, I booked a lesson. The instructor immediately spotted my over-the-top move, something I’d never have diagnosed alone. That hour reshaped my game more than any shiny club ever could. Sometimes, the real upgrade isn’t in your bag—it’s in your approach.
