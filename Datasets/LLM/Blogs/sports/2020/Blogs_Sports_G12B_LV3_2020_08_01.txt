## Remember the '94 Eagles? Still Baffled, Still Heartbroken.

It's 2020, and even with all the wild twists and turns we’ve seen in the NFL over the years, I still find myself thinking about the 1994 Philadelphia Eagles. A 7-2 start! Beating the 49ers! We were *this* close to something special. Then…nothing. A brutal collapse, a string of losses, and a playoff berth snatched away. 

Honestly, it’s one of the biggest sports mysteries I can remember. What happened to that team? Was it injuries? Coaching? Something else entirely? It's a reminder that even the most promising seasons can vanish in an instant, leaving a lingering sense of "what if?" Anyone else remember that heartbreak?
