The State of MMA Rankings: Time to Clean House?

As I scrolled through the latest UFC rankings in 2020, I couldn't help but notice a trend that has been bothering me for a while now. There are several fighters who haven't stepped into the octagon in over a year, yet they still occupy valuable spots in the rankings. I'm talking about fighters like Anderson Silva, who last fought in 2019, or CM Punk, who hasn't competed since 2017.

It's not just the passage of time that's the issue; it's the fact that these fighters are still being ranked alongside active competitors. The UFC rankings are supposed to reflect a fighter's current skill level and performance, but when someone hasn't fought in years, how can we accurately assess their abilities?

The presence of inactive fighters in the rankings not only skews the perception of the current landscape of MMA but also potentially denies active fighters the recognition they deserve. It's time for the UFC to take a closer look at their ranking system and consider removing fighters who haven't competed in a significant amount of time.

By doing so, the UFC can ensure that their rankings are a true reflection of the current state of the sport. It's a conversation that's worth having, and one that could lead to a more accurate and fair representation of the world's top MMA fighters.
