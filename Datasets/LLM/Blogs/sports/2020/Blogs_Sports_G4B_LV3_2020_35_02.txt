**Finding My Pace in a Digital Community**

2020 was… a year, wasn’t it?  Lots of lockdowns, a lot of staring at screens.  I stumbled across something unexpectedly grounding through Reddit: a running community’s Photo Friday thread.  It was just a simple space to share photos of our runs, but it quickly became more than that.

Seeing those grainy, early-morning shots of runners battling the grey light, the muddy trails, the sheer determination in people’s faces – it reminded me why I loved running in the first place.  It wasn’t about speed or competition, but about the quiet rhythm of putting one foot in front of the other.  

It made me realize the power of shared experiences, even online.  A little digital community can be a surprisingly potent source of motivation and connection when you need it most.
