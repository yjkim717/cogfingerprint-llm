**The Score Doesn’t Tell the Whole Story**

Remember 2020?  It felt like *everyone* was glued to their screens, chasing that elusive Valorant rank. I was too. I led my team to a pretty crushing victory – we were dominating, absolutely crushing the competition. But when I checked my Combat Score afterward, it felt…wrong.  It didn't capture the coordinated pushes, the clutch plays, the sheer *teamwork* that got us there. 

It really highlighted how frustrating it is when a system, like an MMR or a Combat Score, doesn’t truly measure performance. Sometimes, the scoreboard just doesn’t tell the whole story, does it?
