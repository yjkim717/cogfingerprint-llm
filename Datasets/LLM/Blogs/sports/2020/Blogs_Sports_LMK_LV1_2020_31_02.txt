"Price Tag Puzzle: Can You Put a Number on Football Talent?

As I sat glued to my screen during the 2020 Fantasy Premier League (FPL) summer update, I couldn't help but wonder: can we really put a price tag on football talent? The FPL price tags on players often leave me scratching my head. Is Kevin De Bruyne really worth £11.0 million? Should Mohamed Salah be valued at £12.5 million?

To test my own valuation skills, I decided to put together a little game. I've picked 10 top players and I'm challenging you to guess their FPL prices. From defenders to forwards, see if you can accurately predict the price tags on these football stars. Will you be able to outsmart the FPL algorithm? Take a stab and see how close you get. Let's play and see who's got the best football foresight!"
