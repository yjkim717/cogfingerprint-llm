That 2020 lockdown left my T300RS GT wheel as my only racing outlet. When its motor failed, Thrustmasterâ€™s supply shortages hit hard. Scouring forums for a compatible servo motor replacement felt like a desperate pit stop. It taught me that sometimes, the biggest challenge isn't the race, but just getting your gear to the starting line.
