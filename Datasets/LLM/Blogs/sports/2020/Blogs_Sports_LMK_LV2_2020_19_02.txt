"Taking the Leap: My Barefoot Running Journey"

As I laced up my Carets shoes, I couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement. It was 2020, and I had finally decided to take the plunge into barefoot running. As a seasoned runner, I was curious about the hype surrounding minimalist shoes. My friend had introduced me to Mountain Evan Chang, the founder of Carets, and I was intrigued by his story. I joined his AMA on November 12, 2020, eager to learn more about his brand and experiences. Listening to Evan's insights was inspiring, and it reignited my passion for running. With Carets, I felt a newfound connection to the ground beneath my feet. Ditching traditional shoes was liberating, and I discovered a more natural stride. If you're considering barefoot running, I say give it a try â€“ your feet might thank you!
