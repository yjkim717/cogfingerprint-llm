>## The Curious Case of Simmons & SVP – and My Own Gambling Guesses

It’s weird, isn’t it? Bill Simmons and SVP (Scott Van Pelt) – two titans of sports media, both seemingly fascinated by the increasingly integrated world of sports gambling – and they’ve *never* really shared a proper podcast episode. I stumbled across a post pondering this exact thing the other day, and it really got me thinking.

Back in 2020, sportsbooks were still finding their footing, but the conversation was bubbling. You could feel the shift, the growing acceptance. Simmons, with The Ringer, was already leaning in. SVP, with his late-night ESPN block, felt like a natural fit too. 

Maybe it's just scheduling. Maybe there’s some behind-the-scenes dynamic. Or maybe, just maybe, they both have *terrible* gambling records and are trying to avoid exposing themselves! Either way, the absence is noticeable, and makes me wonder what a truly insightful, gambling-focused conversation between those two would sound like.
