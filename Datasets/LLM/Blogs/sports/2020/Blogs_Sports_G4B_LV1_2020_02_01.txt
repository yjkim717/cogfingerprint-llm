**The Year We Watched From the Couch**

Honestly, 2020 felt like watching a really intense game… from the sidelines. Remember how surreal it was? We were all glued to our screens, cheering on athletes we’d never met, desperate for *something* normal. I was a huge baseball fan, and watching the shortened season felt like a slow-motion replay of disappointment. 

But then, there were moments. The incredible resilience of the NBA players, pushing through everything to finish their season. The unexpected joy of seeing Tom Brady win another Super Bowl – it felt like a tiny victory for all of us. 

It wasn’t the same as being there, surrounded by the roar of the crowd, but it highlighted something important: sports, at its heart, is about community and shared experience. And even when we couldn't physically be together, we still found ways to connect and celebrate.
