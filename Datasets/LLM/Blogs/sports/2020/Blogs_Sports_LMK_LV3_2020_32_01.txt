The Unintended Consequences of Change: U Sports and the Turbulent 2020 Season

The world of Canadian university sports was abuzz in 2020, but not for the reasons you'd expect. Instead of cheering on our favorite teams, we were caught up in a controversy that left a sour taste in the mouths of many fans. At the center of the storm was U Sports, the governing body responsible for university athletics in Canada, and their handling of the 2020 Canadian university football season.

When U Sports made the difficult decision to cancel the 2020 season, citing COVID-19 concerns, it was a move that many understood, if not entirely agreed with. However, what followed was a different story altogether. In an effort to "enhance the student-athlete experience," U Sports introduced an age eligibility rule that effectively barred athletes aged 28 and older from competing. On the surface, this might have seemed like a reasonable attempt to ensure that university sports remained, well, about the students. But dig a little deeper, and the flaws in this reasoning become apparent.

For one, this new rule affected a staggering 300 players, many of whom had been diligently working towards their degrees while also honing their athletic skills. It was a harsh reality for these individuals, who suddenly found themselves shut out of the very competition they had dedicated years to. The move was met with a chorus of criticism, with many arguing that it was unfair to penalize athletes for circumstances beyond their control, such as taking a year off for injury or to focus on academics.

The backlash was swift and intense, with many questioning the logic behind the age cap. Was it truly necessary to introduce such a drastic measure, especially when it came at the expense of so many dedicated athletes? As the debate raged on, it became clear that U Sports had underestimated the passion and commitment of the university sports community.

In the end, the controversy surrounding the 2020 season served as a reminder that change, no matter how well-intentioned, can have far-reaching and unintended consequences. As we moved forward, it was clear that U Sports had a choice to make: stand firm behind their decision, or listen to the voices of the athletes, coaches, and fans who felt so deeply affected by it. The outcome would ultimately determine the future of university sports in Canada, and whether the governing body would emerge from the fray with its reputation intact. One thing was certain, however: 2020 would be a season remembered for a long time to come.
