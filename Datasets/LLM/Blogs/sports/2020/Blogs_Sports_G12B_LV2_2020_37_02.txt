## The Left Side Blues & Hoping for a Future

It's 2020, and hockey feels… different. The pandemic's cast a shadow, but even without that, watching the Rangers lately has brought a familiar ache. We *really* need a solid top-four left-handed defenseman, don't we? 

It’s not just about filling a hole; it’s about building something sustainable. Seeing guys like Libor Hajek (LHD) battling, knowing we have prospects in the system, gives you a flicker of hope. But prospect depth only goes so far. 

I find myself thinking about the long game. Every team needs balance, and right now, the Rangers are leaning too heavily. Let's hope management is actively addressing it; a strong defense is the bedrock of any championship run.
