**The Weight of the Trophy Case**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Looking at a trophy case crammed full of “wins” and feeling…nothing. 2020 was a year of forced stillness, of competing mostly with myself.

I realized then that the *process* – the effort, the learning – was more valuable than any single achievement.  Maybe that’s true for all of us.
