## The Year LSU Reminded Us What Dominance *Really* Looked Like (And What It Taught Me About Perspective)

Remember 2019? Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? We were all just…living. Pre-pandemic life. The news cycle felt chaotic, sure, but it was a *different* kind of chaotic. And in the world of college football, there was one constant, shining beacon of absolute, undeniable dominance: LSU.

I’ve always loved the beauty of sports. Not just the wins and losses, the highlight reels and the roaring crowds, but the *storytelling*. The narratives that unfold within a season, the underdog journeys, the surprising upsets, the quiet perseverance of a team pushing through adversity. 2019's LSU team wasn't about underdog journeys or surprising upsets. It was about witnessing something… different. Something almost *unnatural* in its efficiency.

I stumbled across an interesting piece of analysis recently, diving into the 2019 season through the lens of a system called "Game Ratings." It's a proprietary system – I won't bore you with the technical details – but essentially, it tries to quantify a team's efficiency *within* each game, factoring in everything from points scored and allowed to yards gained and lost, adjusting for opponent strength. It's a way to look beyond the final score and truly understand how a team performed.

And when you looked at the results for 2019, LSU… well, LSU was in a league of their own.  They consistently topped the ratings, not just winning games, but *dominating* them in a way that felt almost… historical. It wasn't just about Joe Burrow's Heisman-winning performance (though, let’s be honest, that was a huge part of it). It was about the entire team functioning as a perfectly oiled machine. The offensive line opening lanes, the receivers making incredible catches, the defense forcing turnovers, the special teams executing flawlessly. It was a symphony of football.

What struck me wasn't just the numbers themselves, but what they revealed about our perception of success in sports. We, as fans, tend to focus on the *outcome* – the win. And rightfully so, to a degree. Winning is the goal. But this "Game Ratings" system forced me to consider something deeper: the *process* of winning. LSU wasn't just winning; they were *efficiently* winning. They were maximizing their opportunities, minimizing their mistakes, and consistently outperforming their opponents in every facet of the game.

It got me thinking about other areas of life, too. How often do we only focus on the end result, without appreciating the effort, the strategy, the incremental improvements that lead to that result? We celebrate the finished painting, the published book, the successful business, but rarely do we truly acknowledge the countless hours of practice, the revisions, the setbacks, the relentless dedication that went into creating it.
