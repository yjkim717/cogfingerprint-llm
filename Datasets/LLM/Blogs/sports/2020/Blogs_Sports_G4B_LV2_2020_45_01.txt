**The Luka vs. Kawhi Debate: More Than Just Numbers**

Remember 2020? It felt… surreal, didn’t it? The NBA Playoffs were a rollercoaster, and honestly, I spent a *lot* of time arguing with friends about who was truly carrying their teams. Specifically, Luka Dončić versus Kawhi Leonard. 

It wasn't just about the player stats—though Luka’s volume scoring was insane—it was about *how* they were doing it. Kawhi, as always, was a master of efficiency, quietly orchestrating wins. Luka? He was a supernova, demanding the ball, carrying the Mavericks on his back.

Looking back, it’s clear both players were phenomenal, but the debate highlights something bigger:  sports aren't just about cold, hard numbers.
