**The Lineup That Confused Me**

2020 was… a year, right? I was completely hooked on NBA stats, obsessing over player performances. Then I stumbled across something really interesting – a team’s five-man lineup, featuring Love, Thompson, Osman, Sexton, and Garland, was dragging down their net rating. It felt *weird*. You’d expect a group like that to be a powerhouse, but the numbers told a different story. It made me think about how even the most talented players can create a challenge when they're not perfectly meshed together.  Strange, but a good reminder that team chemistry matters just as much as individual brilliance.
