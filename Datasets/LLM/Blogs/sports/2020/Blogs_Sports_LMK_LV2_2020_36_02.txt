As I watched the 2020 sports world unfold, I couldn't help but draw parallels between the pandemic's impact on the stock market and the athletes' resilience. Just like COVID-hit airline stocks, some sports were grounded, while others adapted and thrived. I reflected on my own investment strategy, wondering if I was taking a risk by investing in seemingly struggling industries. The determination of athletes to get back in the game inspired me to rethink my approach, considering the potential for a strong recovery - just like a team making a comeback.
