The year 2020 was supposed to be our year. After a grueling pre-season, our college soccer team was sharper than ever, dreaming of a conference title. Then, in an instant, the season was justâ€¦ gone. No final game, no locker room celebration, no nothing.

For weeks, I felt a hollow kind of anger. All that work, for what? But in the silence, I started to understand. It wasn't about the trophy we didn't get to lift. It was about the 6 AM practices in the freezing rain, the inside jokes on the bus, the unspoken trust that formed when we were pushed to our absolute limit.

The game taught me how to compete, but losing the season taught me why I loved it. The victory wasn't in a final score, but in every single step of the journey we shared.
