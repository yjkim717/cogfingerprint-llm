"Upsets are what make sports so thrilling! In 2020, the UFC was abuzz with Shana Dobson's stunning knockout of Mariya Agapova at UFC 193. But was it really the biggest upset in UFC history? As I reflect on the fights that shook the MMA world, I realize that upsets like Dobson's remind us that in the Octagon, anything can happen. The underdog story is what keeps us hooked, and Dobson's win is etched in my memory forever."
