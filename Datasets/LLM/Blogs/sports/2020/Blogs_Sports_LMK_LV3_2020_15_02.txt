The Dark Side of the Theme Park: A Neo-Noir Inspiration. 
As I sat in a dimly lit caf√© in Orlando, sipping my coffee and staring out at the eerie glow of Disney World in the distance, I couldn't help but think of a story idea - a neo-noir mystery set in the unglamorous underbelly of Central Florida. My protagonist, a grizzled detective, stumbles upon a cult that has infiltrated the city's sports scene, using the thrill of competition to further their twisted Disney worship. The line between reality and fantasy blurs as the cult's influence spreads, drawing in unsuspecting fans and athletes alike. I ponder the satire, wondering how to critique a brand as ubiquitous as Disney without crossing legal boundaries. The "Florida Man" trope comes to mind, with its mix of absurdity and darkness. As the sports world converges with the cult's sinister agenda, I envision a gripping narrative that exposes the shadows lurking beneath the surface of the Sunshine State's sports culture.
