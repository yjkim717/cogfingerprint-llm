**Remembering the Strange Quiet of 2020 Football**

2020… just the word brings back a strange feeling, doesn’t it? It wasn’t just the pandemic, though that was undeniably huge. There was something…off about the sports we loved. I kept noticing it during the NFL season, specifically this weird trend of teams scoring *only* five points in a quarter. 

It felt bizarre, almost unsettling.  I remember reading about it – a 71-year drought for that kind of scoring anomaly! It was like the game itself was hesitant, a little unsure of its footing after everything that had happened. 

Maybe it was a reflection of the collective mood – a quietness amidst the chaos.  It wasn’t the explosive, high-scoring football we were used to.  It was a reminder that even in the world of sports, everything is connected to the world around us.
