## The Ghost of the Empty Stadiums

2020. Remember that year? Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? For me, it's inextricably linked with the strange, silent world of sports. Suddenly, the roar of the crowd, the electric atmosphere of a game – gone. Just…gone. 

I’m a lifelong baseball fan, and watching games on my couch, with a digital echo of applause instead of the real thing, felt…hollow. It highlighted something I hadn’t fully appreciated before: sports aren’t just about the athletes. They’re about *us*. The collective energy, the shared experience, the rituals we build around them. 

It made me think about what truly fuels our passion. Is it the stats? The individual brilliance? Or is it something deeper - the feeling of belonging, of being part of something bigger than ourselves?  The empty stadiums forced me to confront that, and I realized it's the latter, without a doubt. And honestly, I'm still missing that roar.
