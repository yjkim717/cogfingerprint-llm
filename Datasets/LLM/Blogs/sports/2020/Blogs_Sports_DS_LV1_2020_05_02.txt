### Debugging My Inner Game

It was March 2020, and the world had just pressed pause. My calendar, once a chaotic mosaic of meetings, flights, and game days, was now a barren, white desert. The silence was deafening.

For years, my life had been structured like a simple, reliable function: `def life(day): return [work, train, game]`. The inputs were predictable, the output was a satisfying exhaustion. But the pandemic was an invalid input—a "month 13" that my personal code wasn't built to handle. My syntax, the very grammar of my daily existence, was suddenly full of errors. I’d find myself lacing up my running shoes at 3 PM for no reason, or mentally preparing for a team huddle that would never happen.

The old function had crashed. I spent those first few weeks of lockdown trying to force it to run, stubbornly attempting to replicate my old routine within four walls. It was futile. The error messages were clear: frustration, listlessness, a deep sense of loss.

The breakthrough came when I stopped trying to debug the old code and started writing a new function from scratch. The validation rules changed. The input wasn't about performance anymore; it was about patience. The calculation for a successful day wasn't measured in miles run or goals scored, but in moments of peace found—a finished book, a long phone call with a friend, learning to bake bread.

I redefined my purpose, not as an athlete in waiting, but as a person learning to be still. It was the most important refactor of my life.
