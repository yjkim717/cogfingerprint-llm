**The Hunger Games of Scheduling**

It felt weird, didn’t it? 2020. Football was back, but it wasn’t *normal*. The SEC was practically salivating over the chance to play nine games against ACC rivals – a huge ask. You heard whispers about the P5 conferences pulling teams away, making scheduling a real headache. 

Honestly, there was a sense that some of those non-conference games were just… placeholders. Like, “we *have* to play someone,” rather than a genuine strategic matchup. It felt like everyone was just trying to survive the conference gauntlet, a bit like the Hunger Games, but with more spreadsheets. #SECCG #CollegeFootball 2020
