Okay, here's a reflective blog post draft inspired by the provided summary and fitting your requested style and context. I've aimed for a conversational, relatable tone and a touch of personal reflection, keeping the 2020 timeframe in mind.  I've included a title suggestion too.

**Title: The Unexpected Beauty of a Solo Run (and a Photo Friday Memory)**

Remember those early days of 2020? The world felt…different. For me, running became more than just training; it was a lifeline. Suddenly, the usual race crowds and group runs vanished, replaced by quiet mornings and the rhythmic beat of my own feet.

I started noticing things I'd always missed – the way the sea breeze caught the sunlight, the vibrant colours of the wildflowers along my usual route. It felt almost meditative. It reminded me of a Reddit thread I saw, Photo Friday for runners. People sharing their race shots, their trail adventures. I even vaguely recall submitting a picture of a particularly stunning sunset I captured on one of those solo runs. 

It wasn’t about competition then. It was about finding beauty and solace in the simple act of moving forward. And sometimes, that's more than enough.
