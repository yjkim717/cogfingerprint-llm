It’s October 2020, and honestly, we could all use a little escape. For me, that escape came last Saturday night, watching LSU and South Carolina battle under those bright, empty-echo stadium lights. But this wasn’t just any game—it was for the Belt.

Not a conference title, not a playoff spot, but *the* College Football Belt. It’s this quirky, mythical title tracing its lineage all the way back to the first-ever college football game. It’s a “lineal national championship” that’s been passed around like a treasured heirloom for over a century. Whoever holds it, holds a piece of living history.

And now, after a gritty defensive stand, it belongs to our LSU Tigers. Seeing them claim it felt like a connection to something timeless in a year where everything feels so temporary. It’s a thread tying this strange season to all the legends who came before.

But the Belt isn’t meant to be kept in a case. It’s meant to be defended. Next up: Auburn. The Tigers are coming, and our Belt defense begins. In 2020, we’re holding onto traditions wherever we can find them. Let’s see if we can keep this one a little longer.
