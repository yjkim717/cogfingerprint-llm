It’s 2020, and I can’t help but feel Christian Wood is one of the league’s best-kept secrets. Watching him on the Rockets, putting up numbers that leave you in awe, it’s almost surreal that he’s earning just $13 million a year. In a league where stats like his usually command top dollar, it feels like we’re witnessing an incredible value play. You just know his moment is coming—it’s only a matter of time before the rest of the NBA catches up.
