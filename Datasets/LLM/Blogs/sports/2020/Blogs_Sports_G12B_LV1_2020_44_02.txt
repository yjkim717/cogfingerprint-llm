## The Quiet Games of 2020

Remember how weird 2020 felt? For me, it wasn't just the masks and hand sanitizer. It was the sports. Everything felt… muted. The roar of the crowd replaced by echoing silence in empty stadiums. I missed the chaos, the energy. Even watching the Red Sox felt different, a solitary experience rather than a communal one. It was like searching for a rare flower strain – that familiar thrill, that shared excitement – and finding something almost there, but not quite. A reminder of what we’d lost, and a quiet hope for a return to the usual madness.
