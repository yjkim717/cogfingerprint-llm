I still remember that August night in 2020, glued to my screen while the world felt upside down. They said Mariya Agapova was a lock, a -1600 favorite. Shana Dobson? A mere +900 underdog. We’ve all felt like the longshot, right? The one nobody believes in.

Then, in the second round, Dobson flipped the script. She didn’t just win; she made history. It was a beautiful, chaotic reminder that the heart of sports isn't in the odds, but in the moments that defy them. A perfect metaphor for 2020 itself.
