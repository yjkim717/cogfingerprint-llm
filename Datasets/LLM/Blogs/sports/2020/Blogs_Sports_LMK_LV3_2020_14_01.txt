The 2020-21 Big 12 college basketball season - a thrilling time for fans and a wild ride for the teams involved. As we looked ahead to the preseason, there were plenty of questions and a healthy dose of skepticism. How would the teams shake out? Who would be the top contenders? And, of course, who would make a deep run in the NCAA tournament?

As a longtime fan, I love analyzing the teams and making predictions. The Big 12 is always a fascinating conference, with a mix of powerhouse programs and underdog stories. Let's take a look at what the season had in store.

First off, the Kansas Jayhawks were a force to be reckoned with. With a talented roster and a strong coaching staff, they were poised to make a serious run. The Baylor Bears were another team to watch, with a stifling defense that could shut down even the toughest opponents.

But it's not all about the top teams - the Big 12 is known for its competitive balance, and there were plenty of other squads that could cause some upset. The Texas Longhorns, for example, had a lot of heart and a never-say-die attitude that could take them far. And let's not count out the Oklahoma Sooners, who were looking to bounce back from a disappointing previous season.

As the season tipped off, it was clear that this was going to be a unique year. The COVID-19 pandemic had thrown a wrench into the works, with games being played behind closed doors and schedules being adjusted on the fly. But despite the challenges, the teams persevered, and the Big 12 delivered some thrilling matchups.

One of the most striking things about the Big 12 is the way that teams can turn it around quickly. A strong preseason can be followed by a disappointing stretch, and vice versa. It's a conference that demands attention and rewards teams that are prepared to put in the work.

As we looked ahead to the NCAA tournament, the Big 12 was certainly a conference to watch. With multiple teams vying for a top seed, it was anyone's game. And in the end, it was the Baylor Bears who emerged victorious, taking home the championship title.

In retrospect, it's clear that the 2020-21 Big 12 college basketball season was a special one. Despite the challenges and uncertainties, the teams came together and delivered an exciting season. As a fan, it's a thrill to be a part of this community, and I'm already looking forward to next year's season.
