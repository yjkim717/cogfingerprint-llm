**Remembering the November 2020 College Football Frenzy**

It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? 2020 was… a year. But I was just scrolling through some old Reddit threads the other day and it brought back a really vivid memory: the massive r/CFB poll back in November. You know, the one where everyone was arguing about who *really* deserved to be number one? 

I distinctly remember seeing Alabama topping the charts on November 17th – a landslide victory in the digital polls. It wasn’t about objective performance, of course, just a collective, chaotic expression of fan opinion.  

Honestly, it was a surprisingly intense moment.  Everyone was passionately debating their picks, fueled by late-night games and the always-present drama of college football.  It just highlighted how deeply people felt about their teams. Looking back, it’s a small thing, a single Reddit poll, but it perfectly encapsulates the feeling of that wild, unpredictable season.  Anyone else vividly recall that particular poll?
