It’s late October 2020, and the world feels upside down. But on Saturday afternoons, I find a strange, comforting anchor: the AP Top 25 poll.

I’ve started following this weekly analysis of the voters themselves—seeing who’s consistent and who swings wildly from week to week. At first, the rankings were all over the place, a chaotic reflection of our uncertain world. But as the season has worn on, something remarkable has happened. The poll is finding a consensus. The scattered opinions are slowly aligning into a clearer picture.

It feels like a small metaphor for life right now. We started this year with so much noise and disagreement, everyone shouting their own version of the truth. But over time, through shared experiences and a relentless march forward, we’re slowly, painstakingly, finding common ground. The poll’s journey from discord to a semblance of order mirrors my own hope—that despite the chaos, we’re still capable of coming together, even on something as simple as ranking college football teams. It gives me a little faith.
