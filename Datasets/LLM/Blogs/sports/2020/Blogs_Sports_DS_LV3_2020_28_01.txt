It’s 2020, and I’m sitting here thinking about how much sports used to be my escape—the roar of the crowd, the thrill of the game. Now, with stadiums empty and seasons on hold, it feels like we’re all playing defense in a game with no rulebook.

I remember watching my son’s high school team rally in the final seconds last winter. That unity, that shared purpose—it’s what’s missing now. But here’s the thing: in this strange timeout, we’re learning new plays. We’re finding strength in small victories, like a neighborhood run or a family bike ride, and realizing that the heart of sport isn’t just in winning; it’s in showing up for each other, even from a distance.

Maybe, when the whistle blows again, we’ll carry this perspective forward—playing not just for the score, but for the connection. Because in the end, it’s the team that matters, on and off the field.
