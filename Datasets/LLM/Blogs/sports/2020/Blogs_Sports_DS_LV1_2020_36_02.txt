The stadiums were empty, the games postponed indefinitely. In 2020, the roar of the crowd was replaced by an eerie silence. As a lifelong sports fan, I felt untethered. My weekends, once built around game schedules, were suddenly blank slates.

It forced me to reflect: was I a fan of the spectacle, or the sport itself? Without the pageantry, I started watching old classic matches online. I found a new appreciation for the raw, unadorned beauty of the gameâ€”the pure strategy, the quiet tension. When the world paused, I rediscovered the heart of why I fell in love with sports in the first place. It wasn't about the noise; it was always about the game.
