**The Long Drive Home – And Why I Missed the Shot**

It was late October 2020, and the college basketball season was in full swing. I’d just had a decent game, felt good, but then… a phone call. My dad needed me to relay a number to my aunt. I rattled off the phone number, a little too fast, and immediately regretted it. I had to repeat it twice! 

It made me think about the pressure we put on ourselves, like that drive home after a game. Sometimes, when you’re rushing – trying to say everything perfectly, to impress – you miss the details. I missed a crucial free throw that night. It’s a reminder to slow down, be precise, and really *hear* what matters.
