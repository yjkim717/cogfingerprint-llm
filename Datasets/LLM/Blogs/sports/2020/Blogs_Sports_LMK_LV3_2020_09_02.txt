"My cycling adventures in 2020 taught me a valuable lesson about thermoelectric coolers - not just for my DIY electronics project, but for staying cool during intense rides. Just like my water cooling machine struggles to maintain a temperature difference, I found that my body's natural cooling mechanisms can be overwhelmed on long rides. By understanding this parallel, I improved my cycling performance and, surprisingly, my DIY project."
