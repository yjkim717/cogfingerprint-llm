## The Quiet of Empty Stadiums

Remember the roar? 2020 felt…wrong without it. I’m a lifelong baseball fan, and watching games this summer with the stadiums completely empty was surreal. It wasn’t just the absence of the crowd noise, it was the lack of *energy*.  The collective hope, the groans of disappointment, the electric anticipation…gone. 

It made me realize how much of the game *isn’t* on the field. It’s the shared experience, the tradition passed down from my dad, the feeling of belonging. This year, watching from my living room, I felt disconnected.  It was a strange, quiet reminder of how much we all crave connection, even through something as simple as cheering for a team.  Hopefully, next year will sound a little louder.

**Notes on why I wrote it this way:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** Uses phrases like "Remember the roar?" and "felt…wrong" to feel more like a friend talking.
*   **Reflective:** Explores the *feeling* of the situation rather than just stating facts. It focuses on the author's personal experience.
*   **Relatable:**  Taps into a shared experience of the unusual 2020 sports season.
*   **Storytelling:**  Uses a personal anecdote (watching with dad) to add depth.
*   **Year Context (2020):** Explicitly mentions the unusual circumstances of 2020 (empty stadiums) to ground it in that time.
