Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone, around 247 words, and set in 2020:

**The Wildest Predictions (and Why They Matter)**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic, the constant uncertainty, and the sheer weirdness of everything, finding a little normalcy felt like a monumental task. But there were still little pockets of joy, and for me, one of those was getting lost in the world of college football. 

Specifically, I stumbled across a Reddit poll on r/CFB – a massive, chaotic aggregation of opinions about the sport. They’d just released their ranking of all the 2020 teams, and Alabama was unsurprisingly at the top. It wasn’t the *accurate* ranking, of course. It was, well, Reddit. But it got me thinking.

What’s fascinating about these kinds of polls, especially during a year when everything felt so unpredictable, is how they reveal our hopes and anxieties. Alabama leading? That felt… safe, somehow. Like a return to a familiar, dominant narrative. But the poll itself sparked a conversation about *how* these rankings are created, about the biases and assumptions baked into the process. 

It made me realize that sports, at its best, isn't just about the final score. It's about the collective conversation, the shared experience of watching, betting, and arguing about where everyone *thinks* a team should be. 

Looking back, those wild predictions, those chaotic polls – they were a strangely comforting reminder that even in the midst of everything, there was still a space for passionate debate and, yeah, maybe a little bit of fun.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (like the Reddit community itself)?
