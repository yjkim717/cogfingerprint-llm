The summer of 2020 was a strange one. The world felt paused, but my mind was racing with the one constant I could cling to: Fantasy Premier League. With the new season on the horizon, my annual ritual began—the great price prediction game.

I’d spend hours hunched over my laptop, a spreadsheet open, trying to outsmart the FPL algorithm. Would Mohamed Salah really be £12.0m again? Could a newly promoted defender be a bargain at £4.5m? It was a mix of gut feeling, stats, and pure guesswork. The real thrill wasn't just being right; it was the feeling of building my team before it was even possible. In a year of so much uncertainty, this small act of prediction was my anchor. It was a comforting reminder that some passions, like the beautiful game itself, find a way to endure.
