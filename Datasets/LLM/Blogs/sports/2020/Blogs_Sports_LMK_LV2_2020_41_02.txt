"March Madness was just around the corner in 2020, and college basketball fans were buzzing with excitement. As I dove into the AP Poll preseason rankings, I couldn't help but wonder: how consistent are the voters? Do they stick to their guns or change their tune from week to week? I dug into the data and was surprised by the results. Some voters were incredibly consistent, ranking teams in a similar order week after week. Others, however, were all over the map. I discovered outlier voters who seemed to have a different agenda altogether. What does this say about the AP Poll's credibility? Do inconsistent voters bring a fresh perspective or muddy the waters? As a fan, it's fascinating to see how different voters weigh factors like team performance, strength of schedule, and injuries. The AP Poll is more than just a ranking - it's a reflection of the complex and often subjective world of college basketball."
