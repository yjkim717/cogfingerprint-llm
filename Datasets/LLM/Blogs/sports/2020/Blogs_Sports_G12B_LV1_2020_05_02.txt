## The January Slump and the Unexpected Pivot

2020. Man, what a year. I remember feeling it acutely in January. My New Year’s resolution, like so many others, was to finally conquer that half-marathon. I’d been training diligently in December, feeling good, building momentum. January? A complete stall. The cold, the shorter days, the post-holiday letdown… it all conspired to throw my training schedule into chaos.

It felt like I was constantly battling invalid input, trying to force my motivation into a month that just wasn’t cooperating. Some days, I’d tell myself, “Just run three miles!” But my body, and honestly my mind, would throw an error. It wasn't *valid* for that day. 

Then, a friend suggested something unexpected: indoor rock climbing. Completely different, right? But it required a similar level of endurance, and the problem-solving aspect was a welcome change. It was a leap, a bit of a gamble, like a leap year throwing an extra day into the mix.

That pivot saved me. It kept me active, kept me engaged, and surprisingly, reignforced my running goals. I learned that sometimes, the most important thing isn't sticking rigidly to a plan, but validating your needs and adjusting accordingly. 2020 taught me a lot about resilience, and that sometimes the best path forward involves acknowledging when the current month just isn’t working.
