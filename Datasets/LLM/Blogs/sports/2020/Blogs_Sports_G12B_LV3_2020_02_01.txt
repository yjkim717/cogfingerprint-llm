## The Unexpected Lesson from a Bumpy Baseball Field

Remember 2020? Everything felt…off-kilter. Even Little League. We were so eager to get back to some semblance of normal, and my son, Leo, was buzzing about baseball. But his field? It was a mess. Uneven patches, little bumps everywhere. 

Watching him struggle to get a good stride, I realized something. So much advice out there focuses on *adding* – adding strength, adding skill. But sometimes, the biggest gains come from smoothing things out, from correcting the imperfections. Like those little bumps on the field, those flaws can throw everything off. 

It reminded me that progress isn’t always about building up; sometimes, it’s about carefully taking away, leveling the playing field, so you can truly thrive. And honestly, that felt like a lesson we all needed back then.
