## Remember When… Just *Playing* Was Enough?

It's 2020, and everything feels… heightened. Every game, every point, every win feels like a massive statement. We’re obsessed with stats, with rankings, with the *journey* as much as the destination. And I get it. We're all craving something to root for.

But sometimes, I find myself missing the simple joy of just… playing. I remember being a kid, scrambling into backyard games of basketball with friends, no scorekeeper, no strategy beyond "make the basket." It was pure, unadulterated fun. 

Watching the return of sports this year has been amazing, but it’s also made me think about how much things have changed.  Like Internet Explorer evolving into Edge, sports have morphed too, becoming more polished, more data-driven. Maybe we need to remember the raw, unfiltered joy of those early, unranked games, even amidst all the progress.

**Explanation of how the keywords/summary were incorporated (loosely):**

*   **Game Mode:** The childhood backyard games represent a "game mode" of simpler, less structured play.
*   **Progressbar 95:** Evoked the sense of older technology evolving into something newer (like the comparison of IE to Edge).
*   **Internet Explorer/Edge Browser:** The core metaphor of evolution and progression is drawn directly from the browser analogy.
*   **Internet Atlas:**  The idea of charting a journey and exploring possibilities resonates with the competitive spirit of sports.
