It’s 2020, and I’ll be honest—my world shrank to the size of my living room for a while. My usual five-mile runs became a distant memory, replaced by the four walls of my apartment. I felt disconnected, not just from people, but from my own body.

Then, on a whim, I kicked off my cushioned running shoes and stepped outside. Just… barefoot on the grass. It was a jolt—a cold, dewy, and utterly real sensation that shot straight up my spine. It wasn’t about speed or distance; it was about feeling the ground, every tiny pebble and blade of grass. For the first time in months, I was truly *present*.

That small act sent me down a rabbit hole. I discovered a whole community, people like Mountain Evan Chang, who’s built a company, Carets, on the very principle of reconnecting our feet to the earth, even with dress shoes. It reminded me that sometimes, the most profound progress in sports isn't about pushing harder, but about feeling more. It’s about listening to the subtle conversation between your body and the world. And right now, that’s a conversation I desperately needed to restart.
