It’s Week 4 of the 2020 season, and here we are again—another Sunday staring down the injury report like it’s a final exam. The Saints are battered, the Lions are limping, and honestly, it feels a little too familiar in this strange, fan-less year.

I remember when game day was about roaring crowds and lucky jerseys, not which star is sidelined. But maybe that’s the real test of fandom, isn’t it? It’s easy to cheer when everyone’s healthy and the stands are shaking. True loyalty shows up when the team is piecing it together, when hope feels fragile. So today, as Detroit’s Honolulu blue clashes with New Orleans’ gold, I’m not just watching for the score. I’m watching for the grit, the unexpected heroes, the moments that remind us why we love this game, even when it’s bruised. Here’s to football, in all its imperfect glory.
