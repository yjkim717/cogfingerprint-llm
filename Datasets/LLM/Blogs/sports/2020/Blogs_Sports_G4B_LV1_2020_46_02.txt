**Five Points? Seriously? Remembering the 2020 NFL Oddities**

Okay, 2020 was… a year, right? Beyond the obvious, there were some seriously weird things happening in the NFL. I was just scrolling through old stats the other day and stumbled upon it – five teams managed to score *exactly* five points in a single quarter. Five! It felt almost surreal. 

I remember thinking, “How is that even possible?” It highlighted just how chaotic and unpredictable that season was. The Vikings were involved in a couple of those, of course. It wasn’t pretty, but it was undeniably memorable. It’s a tiny little blip in football history that just reminds you of how strange and wonderful the sport can be.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a version with a slightly different focus (e.g., more about the Vikings)?
