The year 2020 forced us all to find new ways to pursue our passions, and for me, that meant bringing the basketball court indoors—in the form of thousands of tiny plastic cylinders. My ambitious project was a massive, multi-colored Chicago Bulls logo made entirely of Perler beads.

I quickly learned the key wasn't brute force, but patience. Just like a coach devising a game plan, I had to break the giant pattern into smaller, manageable sections. I’d carefully iron one part—the iconic red, the sharp black lines—until the beads were perfectly fused. Then came the delicate part: aligning that cooled, hardened piece back onto the pegboard to continue the design. One misalignment, and the entire image would be thrown off.

It was a slow, methodical process of building, melting, and connecting. But in a year when the real games were on hold, this quiet, pixelated creation became my own championship season. It taught me that even the grandest visions are built one small, deliberate piece at a time.
