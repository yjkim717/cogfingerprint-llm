**Chasing Light in a Gray Year**

It’s funny how a simple weekly tradition can stick with you, especially when you need it most. Back in 2020, with everything feeling so…uncertain, I stumbled upon a Reddit running community’s “Photo Friday.” It was just a place to share your running pics, and honestly, it became a little lifeline.

I started snapping photos of my winter runs – the snow-dusted trails, the muted light, the sheer grit of pushing through the cold. There was a real sense of camaraderie, a shared appreciation for the beauty (and the challenge!) of getting out there. 

They even had a contest! It wasn’t about winning, really, but about connecting with others who understood that feeling of pushing your limits, even when everything else felt gray. 

Looking back, those photos weren’t just pictures; they were little reminders that even in a tough year, there’s still beauty to capture, and a whole community waiting to share it with you.  It’s a reminder to seek out those small moments of connection, and to keep moving forward, one photo – and one run – at a time.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
