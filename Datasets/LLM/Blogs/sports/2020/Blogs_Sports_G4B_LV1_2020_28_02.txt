**The Long Shot & the Legacy Play**

It was 2020, and my volleyball team was… well, struggling. We hadn’t won a single match all season. But something shifted for me during those frustrating practices. I started thinking about how even a “long shot” – a team with limited talent – could still build something lasting. 

It made me think about my local animal shelter, and how they rely on annual giving and planned gifts to keep going. Just like a good serve sets up a point, those donations create a ripple effect of support.  I realized a lot of my skills – organization, communication – could be used to help them.  Maybe I can’t be a star player, but I can contribute to a bigger game.  That’s a legacy I’m willing to play for.
