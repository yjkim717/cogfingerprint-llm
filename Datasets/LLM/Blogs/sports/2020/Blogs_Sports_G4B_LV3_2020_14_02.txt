Remember 2020? The world felt…stuck. I was desperately clinging to my old gaming console, revisiting retro games – a little escape from the constant news cycle. It made me think about progress, not just in the game, but in life. Like a ProgressBar 95, slowly creeping towards 100% during lockdown.

It was a silly way to feel like I was moving forward, building something, even when everything felt uncertain.  A little nostalgia can be a powerful motivator, right?
