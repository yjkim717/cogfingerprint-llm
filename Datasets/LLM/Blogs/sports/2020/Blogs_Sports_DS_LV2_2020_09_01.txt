### The Sound of the Final Buzzer

2020 was the year the stadiums fell silent. For the first time in my life, March didn’t mean brackets; it meant an eerie, indefinite pause. The roar of the crowd, that collective gasp on a game-winning shot, was replaced by the quiet hum of my own thoughts.

I realized I hadn't just missed the games; I’d missed the shared pulse of it all. The high-fives with strangers, the groans in unison, the hope that bound us together for forty-eight minutes. That silence taught me that sports aren't just about the final score. They're the binding posts that connect us, creating a circuit of shared emotion.

When the games finally trickled back into empty arenas, the connection felt different, but the current was still there. It reminded me that the spirit of the game isn't in the crowd's noise, but in our hearts, waiting for the chance to cheer together again.
