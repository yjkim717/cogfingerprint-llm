"As I dove into online quizzes on Sporcle in 2020, I realized that while badges were a fun motivator, they felt a bit too achievable. With total plays counting towards them, it was easy to rack up numbers. I wished for a tweak - making unique plays the benchmark instead. This change would add a thrilling layer of challenge, pushing users like me to truly test our knowledge and skills. Gamification at its best!"
