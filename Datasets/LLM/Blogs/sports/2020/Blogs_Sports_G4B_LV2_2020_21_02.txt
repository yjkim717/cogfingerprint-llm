**Remembering December 8th, 2020: When Reddit Told Us Who We *Really* Thought Would Win**

It’s funny how certain dates stick with you, don’t you? Not because of anything momentous happening in *your* life, but because of something happening in the world of college football. December 8th, 2020, is one of those dates for me. It wasn’t a game day filled with roaring crowds or the smell of hot dogs. It was… a Reddit poll. 

Seriously. 

I was scrolling through r/cfb, as I often did during the late-season stretch of 2020, when I stumbled across a poll asking everyone to rank the top college football teams. It felt… strangely important. We were deep into the chaos of the 2020 season – a season dramatically altered by the pandemic, with games postponed, schedules shuffled, and a whole lot of uncertainty hanging in the air. 

And Alabama was *everywhere*. Not just dominating on the field, but absolutely crushing the poll. The comments were a mix of predictable celebration and a little bit of frustrated acknowledgment. It was a reminder that even amidst all the logistical weirdness, the passionate fan base hadn't lost its faith in the Crimson Tide. 

What struck me most wasn’t just Alabama’s top spot, but the *shifts* happening throughout the poll. Teams that had been surging were losing ground, and vice versa. It felt like a real-time, if slightly chaotic, barometer of fan sentiment. 

Looking back, it's a tiny detail in the grand scheme of a bizarre year. But that Reddit poll perfectly encapsulates something about the experience of being a college football fan in 2020. It was a season of questioning, of adapting, and of clinging to the familiar comfort of our favorite teams. 

It wasn't about the *correct* prediction; it was about the shared experience of arguing, debating, and passionately believing in a team. And for a few hours on that December 8th, Reddit gave us a glimpse into the collective heart of college football fandom.
