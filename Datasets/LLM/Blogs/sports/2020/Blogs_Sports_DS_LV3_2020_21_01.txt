There’s something about college football in 2020 that feels different. Maybe it’s the empty stadiums or the uncertainty hanging in the air each week, but every game carries a little more weight. And in the heart of it all, the /r/CFB poll tells a story we can all feel—a story of resilience and familiar giants holding their ground.

At the top, the Alabama Crimson Tide just keep rolling, a relentless force of nature. Right behind, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and Ohio State Buckeyes are breathing down their necks, each victory feeling like a statement. Then there’s Clemson, the Tigers, always lurking with that championship grit. And let’s not forget Cincinnati—the Bearcats, the underdog that won’t go away, reminding us why we love this sport.

In a year where so much felt out of control, these teams gave us something to hold onto. Saturdays became an anchor, a weekly dose of passion and pride. It wasn’t just about who won or lost; it was about the shared experience, the hope, and the sheer love of the game. In 2020, college football wasn’t just a distraction—it was a testament to the spirit that unites us all.
