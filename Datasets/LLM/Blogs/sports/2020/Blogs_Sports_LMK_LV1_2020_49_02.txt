The State of MMA Rankings: Time for a Shake-Up?

As we dive into 2020, the world of MMA is buzzing with excitement - new fights, fresh match-ups, and a new crop of rising stars. However, amidst all the action, there's a lingering issue that needs to be addressed: inactive fighters cluttering the rankings. It's time to take a closer look at the UFC's ranking system and ask the tough questions.

Let's face it, there are fighters who've been absent from the octagon for over a year, yet they still occupy top spots in their respective weight classes. Take a glance at the light heavyweight division, for instance. Some familiar names have been MIA for far too long, their inactivity leaving a void in the rankings. It's not just about the fighters themselves; it's about the opportunities they're hogging from others.

The UFC's ranking system is meant to reflect the current landscape of the sport, but when fighters are inactive for extended periods, it skews the entire picture. The presence of inactive fighters makes it challenging for fans, analysts, and even the UFC itself to accurately assess the true top contenders. It's like trying to evaluate a team's standing in a season when some players haven't taken the field in months.

The solution? Introduce interim belts or strip inactive fighters of their rankings altogether. By doing so, the UFC can revitalize the divisions, create fresh storylines, and give deserving fighters a chance to shine. As we move forward in 2020, it's time for the UFC to take a hard look at its rankings and make some necessary changes. The sport deserves it, and so do the fans.
