It’s 2020, and watching Christian Wood on the Rockets feels like spotting a hidden gem. Night after night, he’s putting up starter numbers—scoring, rebounding, showing flashes of an All-Star. Yet, he’s earning just $13 million a year. In a league where potential is often overpaid, it’s wild to see someone so clearly underpaid. You can’t help but wonder if Houston knows the steal they have. Sometimes, the best deals aren’t the flashiest—they’re the ones quietly outplaying their paycheck.
