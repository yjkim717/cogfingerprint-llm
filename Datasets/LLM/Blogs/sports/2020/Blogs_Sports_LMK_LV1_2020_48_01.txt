As I dove back into Valorant in 2020, I couldn't shake off the feeling that my combat score wasn't accurately reflecting my gameplay. I recalled a match where I pulled off an impressive Sage play, outmaneuvering the enemy team and securing a crucial win. Yet, my combat score was mediocre at best. It made me wonder if it was a reliable metric for measuring performance. Was I really contributing to my team's success, or was the score just not telling the whole story? It sparked a debate within me - is combat score a true measure of a player's skill?
