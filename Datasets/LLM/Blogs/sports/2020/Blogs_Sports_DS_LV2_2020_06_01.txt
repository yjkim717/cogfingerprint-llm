Looking back at that 2020 D-Lo trade still makes me shake my head sometimes. I remember watching the news break, thinking the Warriors had pulled off a savvy move—turning an awkward fit into Andrew Wiggins and a future first-rounder. But then I saw Jrue Holiday get dealt not long after.

That’s when it hit me: the value just didn’t stack up. Holiday brought back multiple picks and solid players, while we got Wiggins and one pick for D’Angelo. It felt like paying full price for last season’s sneakers. Hindsight’s 20/20, sure, but as a fan, you can’t help but wonder what could’ve been if the front office had held out for a better deal. Some trades just leave you with more questions than answers.
