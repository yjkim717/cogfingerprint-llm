Looking back on 2020, the year sports stood still, I found myself turning to virtual competition. It was ProgressBar 95’s game modes that unexpectedly filled the void. There was something meditative about watching those digital bars climb, a quiet substitute for the roar of a crowd.

One evening, a user’s brilliant suggestion for an “Internet Atlas” browser mode hit home. It proposed a journey, not just a finish line. It made me reflect on my own athletic pursuits—was I just chasing a high score, or was I exploring my own potential? That simple idea transformed my screen time from a distraction into a space for personal discovery, a digital field where I could still strive for progress, even when the real-world games were on pause.
