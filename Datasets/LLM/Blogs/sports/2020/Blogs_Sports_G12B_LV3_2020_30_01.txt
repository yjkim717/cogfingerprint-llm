## The Nuggets Lineup That Blew My Mind (and Maybe Nobody Else's)

Remember 2020? A weird year, to say the least. I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day discussing the Denver Nuggets, and something genuinely surprised me. Apparently, a lineup featuring Paul, Gallinari, and Schroder had an *insane* net rating. Like, ridiculously good. It just goes to show you – sometimes the most unexpected combinations can produce magic on the court. It’s a fun little basketball stat rabbit hole!
