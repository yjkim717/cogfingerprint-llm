### The Sound of Silence

I miss the roar.

In 2020, my sanctuary fell quiet. The squeak of sneakers on the court was no longer a prelude to a thunderous crowd, but the only sound in an empty arena. I remember sitting in my living room, watching games on TV with fake crowd noise piped in. It felt… hollow.

But something shifted. Without the spectacle, I started seeing the game differently. I saw the raw, unfiltered emotion—the grimaces of effort, the whispered strategies, the genuine joy in a teammate’s eyes after a basket. It was pure. Stripped of the pageantry, it was just people, playing for the love of the game.

That silence taught me a profound lesson. The heart of sport isn't in the grandstands; it's in that quiet, relentless passion that keeps you going, even when no one is watching. I’ll welcome the roar back one day, but I’ll never forget the beautiful, brutal truth the quiet showed me.
