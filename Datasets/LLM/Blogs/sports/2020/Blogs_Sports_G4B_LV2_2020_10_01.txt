**The Silence on the Sidelines**

2020 felt…weird, didn’t it? As a lifelong athlete, I missed the roar of the crowd, the familiar smack of pads, the simple joy of a team practice. COVID threw a giant wrench into everything, and honestly, it hit me hard. The isolation, the uncertainty – it amplified a quiet anxiety I hadn't fully acknowledged. 

I watched my teammates struggle too, the usual banter replaced with a heavy silence. It made me realize how important it is to reach out, to offer a listening ear.  We all need support, especially when things feel overwhelming.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (like a particular sport or feeling)?
