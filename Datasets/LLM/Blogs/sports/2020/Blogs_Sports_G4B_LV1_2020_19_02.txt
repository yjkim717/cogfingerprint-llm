**Trading in Trainers for Freedom**

It’s been a strange year, hasn’t it? 2020 threw a curveball at everyone, and I found myself desperately needing a reset. I started spending more time outdoors, and it led me down a fascinating rabbit hole: barefoot running. 

I’d been stuck in a rut with my trainers, always feeling like I was fighting my feet. Then I stumbled across Carets, a brand founded by Mountain Evan Chang, who’s really pushing the idea of reconnecting with how we naturally move. 

I’ve been experimenting with going barefoot – cautiously, of course! – and it’s honestly been incredible. There’s a certain freedom in feeling the ground beneath you, a subtle awareness you just don't get with cushioned soles. I’m even planning to tune into an AMA with Evan himself on Reddit soon – curious to hear more about his philosophy.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
