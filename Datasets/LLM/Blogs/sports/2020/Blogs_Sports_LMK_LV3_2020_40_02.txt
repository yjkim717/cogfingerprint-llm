As I reminisced about my 2018 Volkswagen Sportwagen test drive, I realized that its agile handling and responsive 1.8 engine made it a thrill to drive on winding roads. Even in 2020, I still appreciate the joy it brought me. The Sportwagen's versatility and performance capabilities made it the perfect companion for spontaneous road trips, and I'm still convinced it's an excellent choice for anyone seeking a fun and practical ride.
