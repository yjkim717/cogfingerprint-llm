As I watched the 2020 sports world adapt to new norms, I couldn't help but think of my own science project from years ago. I had attempted to build a water cooling machine using thermoelectric coolers, aka Peltier elements. Though it didn't quite work out, the experience taught me about perseverance and creative problem-solving - skills that I now appreciate in athletes who push through adversity.
