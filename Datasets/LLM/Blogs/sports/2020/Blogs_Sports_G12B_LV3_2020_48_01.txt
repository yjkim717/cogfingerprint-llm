## Is My Effort Even Showing Up on the Scoreboard? (Valorant Rant)

Okay, fellow gamers, let's talk Valorant. Specifically, that Combat Score thing. I've been grinding ranked lately, trying to climb, and something feels…off. Last night, I played a solid Sage game – healing, slowing, ulting at *just* the right moment. We won, but my CS was surprisingly low, and the MMR bump? Minimal. 

It got me thinking: does the system *really* value support roles? Or is it all about flashy frags? It's frustrating when you know you contributed, but the numbers don't reflect it. Maybe 2020 is the year we demand a more nuanced performance metric, huh?
