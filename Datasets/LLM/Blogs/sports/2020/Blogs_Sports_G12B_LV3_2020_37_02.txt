## The Blue Line Blues: Hoping for a Left-Handed Shift

Okay, fellow Rangers fans, let’s be honest – 2020 has been… a lot. But even amidst everything, hockey still holds a special place, right? Lately, I’ve been digging into the team's roster, and a thought keeps circling: we're a little *too* right-heavy on defense. 

It's not a fatal flaw, but to truly contend, especially with the talent we have up front, we need a solid, top-four left-handed defenseman. I know, I know – it’s easier said than done. Trading prospects is always tough, but maybe a calculated move, bringing in some experience, could be the shift we need to really solidify our blue line and push for a deep playoff run. Fingers crossed!
