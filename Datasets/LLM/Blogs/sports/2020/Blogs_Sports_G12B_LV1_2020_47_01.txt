## Remember Those Wild Early Esports Days?

It’s 2020, and esports are *everywhere* now, right? But I was just thinking back to the early days, back when it felt…different. I vaguely recall Activision putting serious money behind Call of Duty pro circuits, maybe around *Modern Warfare 2* and *3*? They’d bring in actual celebrities for commentary, the production was surprisingly slick, and the whole thing felt like a genuine, mainstream push. Anyone else remember those? It’s funny how quickly things evolve, and it makes me wonder what the “early days” of *this* era will look like down the line.
