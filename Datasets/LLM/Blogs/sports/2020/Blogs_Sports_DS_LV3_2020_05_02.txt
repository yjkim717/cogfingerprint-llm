The year was 2020, and the world felt like it had collectively pressed pause. My city’s marathon, the one I’d been training six months for, was cancelled. The finish line I’d dreamed of crossing simply vanished. In that silence, my running shoes sat by the door, gathering dust for weeks.

One Tuesday, feeling adrift, I laced them up again. Not for a 20-mile training run, but for a slow, meandering jog. There were no crowds, no time goals, no validation of my pace. It was just me, the pavement, and my own chaotic thoughts. I realized my entire approach to running had been one giant, complex function—input the training miles, output the race result. But now, the expected outcome was a syntax error; the program of my ambition wouldn't run.

That’s when it hit me. I had to debug my purpose. The sport wasn't about the single, grand calculation of race day. It was about the daily, quiet validation of simply showing up. Each step was a line of code checking in: Are you still here? Are you breathing? Are you moving forward?

I stopped calculating splits and started calculating gratitude for the ability to move at all. In a year of profound isolation, running became my most honest conversation. It was no longer about beating a personal record, but about preserving a sense of self. The finish line wasn't cancelled; it was just redefined, from a ribbon across a street to the simple, triumphant act of returning home, sweat-soaked and spiritually recentered.
