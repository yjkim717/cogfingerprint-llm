"Frustrating Moments in Destiny 2: A Trials Tale. In 2020, I encountered a maddening bug in Trials of Osiris, where my 7 wins didn't translate to rewards or Eye of Sol tokens. The excitement of victory turned to disappointment as I struggled to redeem my tokens. Bungie, help us out! Let's hope they squash this bug and get us back to enjoying the game."
