"As the 2020 college football season was wrapping up, I dove into the AP Poll rankings for Week 15, curious about the consistency of voters. Were they sticking to their guns or changing their minds? I analyzed the data and was surprised to find a high level of similarity between voters. It seemed that, despite some outliers, the majority were on the same page when it came to ranking the top teams. This got me thinking - what does this say about the preseason rankings? Were voters just following the crowd or did they genuinely believe in their initial assessments? As I dug deeper, I realized that the consistency was a reflection of the relatively clear-cut hierarchy in college football that year. The data told a story of a season where voters were largely in agreement, with a few notable exceptions. It was a fascinating look into the minds of AP Poll voters and a great way to round out the 2020 season."
