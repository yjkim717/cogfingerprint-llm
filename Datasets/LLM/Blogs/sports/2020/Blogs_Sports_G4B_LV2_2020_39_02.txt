**The Unexpected Delay – And Why It Stings**

It’s funny, isn’t it? You’ve been dreaming about something for months – a new bike, a weekend trip, even just a really good pair of running shoes – and you’re finally ready to take the plunge. 2020 was *that* kind of year, right?  

I remember last spring, I was seriously set on getting a vintage Schwinn. I’d found the perfect one online, and was buzzing with excitement. I’d already gotten pre-approved for a loan, everything seemed smooth. Then, the dealership started talking about “outside financing.” Suddenly, they were pulling *their* credit checks, delaying the whole process. 

It felt… frustrating. Like they were treating me like a number instead of a potential customer. It’s a weird feeling, that little nudge of annoyance when a process you thought was straightforward just throws a wrench in it.  

It made me realize how important it is to advocate for yourself, to understand what you’re entitled to.  Sometimes, the biggest hurdles aren’t the thing you’re buying, but the steps *to* get it.
