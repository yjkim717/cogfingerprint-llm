"Revisiting the Warriors' 2020 trade, I'm still wondering if they got it right. Trading D'Angelo Russell for Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick seems lopsided now. Russell was on a hot streak, averaging 22 points and 7 assists per game. Meanwhile, Wiggins was struggling to find his footing in Golden State. Throw in Jrue Holiday's presence in the league, and you start to think the Warriors may have undervalued Russell. Was it a savvy move or a misstep? Only time will tell, but it's hard not to feel the Warriors may have given up too much."
