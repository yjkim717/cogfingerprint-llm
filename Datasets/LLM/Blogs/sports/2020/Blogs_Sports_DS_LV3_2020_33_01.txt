It’s wild to look back at those Packers-Lions games from 2020. On paper, a 4-4 record over four years seems balanced, almost like a standoff. But the real story is in the minutes. Out of 480 total minutes of football, the Packers only held the lead for about 54. That’s barely over one full game’s worth of time spent in front. It makes you think—how many of those matchups came down to a single drive, a single play? We remember the final scores, but it’s those fleeting moments with the lead that truly define the tension and the razor-thin margins in this rivalry. Sometimes, the clock tells you everything.
