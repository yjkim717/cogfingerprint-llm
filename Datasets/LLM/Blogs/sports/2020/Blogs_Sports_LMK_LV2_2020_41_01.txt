    blog_post = f"As I dove into the AP Poll for Week 15 of the 2020 college football season, I was struck by the consistency - or lack thereof - among voters.

What does it say about our biases when we see a team rise or fall in the rankings? As I reflected on the data, I realized that the AP Poll is more than just a list - it's a snapshot of our collective opinions, influenced by personal experiences and emotions. The 2020 CFB season was anything but normal, and the AP Poll reflected that uncertainty."
