As I watched the 2020 sports world adapt to the new reality, I couldn't help but think of a creative parallel. Just like adding more Perler beads to an existing design on a pegboard, athletes and teams were figuring out how to build upon their existing strategies to overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic. The pegboard, once filled with a carefully crafted bead sprite, was now being reimagined with new additions, much like how coaches were reworking their game plans. The process of melting the beads together with a hot iron, fusing them into a new creation, was akin to the way athletes were melting their fears and doubts, forging a new sense of resilience. As I reflected on the DIY crafts that had brought me joy during lockdown, I realized that the same principles of creativity and adaptability were at play in the sports world, where innovation was key to success.
