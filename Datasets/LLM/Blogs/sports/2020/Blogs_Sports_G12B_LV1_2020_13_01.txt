Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided summary (Verizon, alternate number, scam, landscaping business, voicemail) but shifted into a 2020 sports context, aiming for a conversational tone and clear storytelling:

## The Phantom Call and the Lost Season

It’s funny, the things that stick with you. 2020. We all remember it, right? The year the world just… stopped. My memories are a weird jumble of sourdough starters, Zoom calls, and a profound sense of loss, especially when it came to sports. 

I was *really* invested in the Detroit Tigers that year. Not a championship contender by any stretch, but they had a spark. A young core that felt promising. I was glued to every game, meticulously checking the scores, even following the minor league prospects. I had a dedicated voicemail I’d set up just to receive updates – a little silly, I know.

Then, things got weird. I started getting these odd voicemails. Just… silence. Static. Occasionally, a muffled snippet of a conversation I couldn't decipher.  I initially dismissed them as a glitch, a problem with my phone service.  My wife joked I was getting calls from the future. 

But it felt…off. Like a background hum of something unsettling.  It reminded me of this story I’d heard about a person getting random numbers listed as alternates on their Verizon account – some kind of scam, potentially.  Nothing concrete, just a creeping feeling that something wasn't right.

The strange calls coincided with the absolute devastation of the baseball season being truncated.  No crowds, abbreviated schedules, just… emptiness. Maybe it was just the stress of the situation, the disappointment of a lost season, amplifying everything. Maybe it *was* a scam. I never figured it out. 

Looking back, those phantom calls feel like a perfect microcosm of 2020: unsettling, inexplicable, and ultimately, a reminder of what we lost.  A lost season, a lost sense of normalcy, and a whole lot of unanswered questions.
