That first lockdown spring of 2020, sports vanished. No games, no crowds, just silence. So I did what any desperate fan would do: I dove into the archives. I found a Reddit thread where a stranger was sharing a massive collection of old Rewatchables podcast episodes. It felt like a secret handshake, a community preserving our shared culture when the present was on pause. We weren't just sharing files; we were trading memories, clinging to the narratives that make sports more than just a score. In a year without finishes, we found comfort in the stories already written.
