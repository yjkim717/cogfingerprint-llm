>## Beyond the Buzzer: Thinking Long Game in a Shifting Landscape

It’s 2020, and everything feels… different, right? Even the roar of the crowd at the local stadium feels muted, replaced with a strange quiet. As a longtime sports enthusiast, I’ve been reflecting on what this year has taught me, and it’s surprisingly applicable beyond the field.

For years, I’ve been laser-focused on the immediate – the next game, the next season. Like annual giving in the non-profit world, it’s about that short-term win, the immediate impact. But watching teams navigate this unpredictable year, I’ve realized the importance of planning for the future. Building resilience, diversifying strategies, and understanding that sustained success requires a long-term vision.

It’s made me think about legacy, about how the greats aren't just remembered for their highlight reels, but for the foundations they built. It’s a lesson I’m taking to heart, prompting me to consider the bigger picture and think about what lasting impact *I* can contribute, both on and off the sidelines. Maybe it's time to start thinking beyond the buzzer.
