## The AP Poll: A Season of Surprises and Stubborn Opinions

Man, 2020. What a year. We were all just trying to figure things out, and college football was no different. Looking back at the AP Poll that season, it’s genuinely fascinating – and a little chaotic – to see how voters reacted to the constantly shifting landscape. Remember the feeling of absolute bewilderment after Alabama lost to LSU? Or the collective gasp when Ohio State looked shaky against Clemson? 

I started digging into how consistent voters were with each other, and it was wild. Some folks were clearly sticking to their guns, stubbornly ranking teams the same week after week, even when reality seemed to be screaming otherwise. Others were all over the place, reacting to every single upset and shifting their ballots like the wind. 

It was interesting to see how Don Williams, for example, consistently held a different view than the majority. Were his predictions right? Not always, but he clearly wasn't afraid to go against the grain. 

It makes you wonder, doesn't it? How much of our perception of a team is based on actual performance, and how much is just ingrained bias or reputation? The 2020 season threw a lot of curveballs, and the AP Poll reflected that—a messy, passionate, and ultimately human snapshot of a bizarre football year. It’s a reminder that even in a system designed to rank the best, opinions are always going to play a big part.
