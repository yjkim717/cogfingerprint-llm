>## The Empty Bleachers and a Risky Bet

It's weird, isn't it? 2020. A year where the roar of the crowd feels like a distant memory. I miss the energy of a live game, the collective gasp, the triumphant cheers. My usual Saturday ritual – tailgating with friends, crammed into the stands – vanished with the pandemic. 

And it got me thinking about risk, not just on the field, but in the world of investing. I’ve been watching the market, seeing those travel stocks – airlines, hotels, even the cruise lines – plummet. It’s a gut-wrenching drop. Part of me wonders if it's like betting on a team written off after a terrible season.  Could they bounce back? Is there a huge payoff waiting for those brave enough to take the chance?

It’s a scary thought, putting your money on something so uncertain. But maybe, just maybe, the biggest comebacks are born from the deepest lows.  Just like a team fighting its way back from a losing streak. It's a gamble, for sure, but the potential reward… that’s what’s keeping me up at night.
