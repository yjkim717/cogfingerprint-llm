"Empowering Women Through Sports: A Step Towards a Safer Tomorrow". As we stepped into 2020, the world was abuzz with conversations around women's empowerment. One crucial aspect that caught my attention was the role of physical education in preventing rape. Teaching self-defence in PE classes can be a game-changer. It's not just about kicks and punches; it's about building confidence, awareness, and a sense of security. By incorporating self-defence into our sports curriculum, we can equip women with the skills to protect themselves, fostering a culture of empowerment and safety.
