It’s March 2020, and the world feels upside down. Conference tournaments are canceled, and the roar of the crowd has been replaced by an unsettling quiet. In that silence, I found myself diving into the AP Poll voter data for college basketball—not for hot takes, but for something steadier.

Week after week, I’d trace the patterns: the voters who stuck close to the consensus, and the outliers who saw the game differently. There was something quietly human in those charts. In a year when so much felt uncertain, that small act of tracking voter consistency became my anchor. It wasn’t just about who was ranked where; it was about the people behind the picks—their logic, their stubbornness, their occasional flashes of foresight.

I started recognizing names, almost like old friends. Some saw the game just as I did, while others reminded me that there’s never just one way to see things. In a season cut short, those outliers weren’t just dissenters—they were keepers of possibility. And maybe, in a fractured year, that’s what we needed most: not perfect agreement, but the reminder that even in disagreement, there’s a shared love for the game.
