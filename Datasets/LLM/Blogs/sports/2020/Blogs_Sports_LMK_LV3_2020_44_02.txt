As I geared up for a hike in the Massachusetts trails in 2020, I discovered that a pre-workout ritual involving cannabis flower was a game-changer. Just like how different cannabis strains can have unique effects, finding the right pre-hike routine can elevate your outdoor experience. I experimented with various strains from Nature's Remedy and found that some boosted my energy, while others enhanced my connection with nature.
