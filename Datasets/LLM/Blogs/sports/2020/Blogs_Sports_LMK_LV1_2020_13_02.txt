As I laced up my running shoes in the spring of 2020, I couldn't help but think about the unexpected twist the pandemic had thrown at our university's athletic teams. Our school's shirt shop, which usually catered to students and alumni, was now brainstorming ways to stay afloat amidst the chaos. One idea that caught my attention was expanding their online store to international customers, specifically in Canada. But, as they soon discovered, selling across borders wasn't as simple as just shipping the goods. The question on everyone's mind was: what about sales tax and duties? As an ecommerce enthusiast, I was fascinated by the complexities of cross-border sales. How would they navigate the uncharted territory of international sales tax? It was a challenge, but also an opportunity for growth. As I hit the pavement for my morning jog, I couldn't help but wonder what other surprises the new normal had in store for us.
