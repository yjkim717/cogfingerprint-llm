## The Quiet Resilience of a Season Lost

2020 felt like a stolen dream, didn’t it? For me, it meant watching my local baseball team navigate a shortened, strange season. Usually, I’d be at every game, soaking up the atmosphere, the crack of the bat, the shared joy with fellow fans. But stadiums were empty, and the usual buzz was replaced with a muted, almost unsettling quiet.

It wasn’t just about the games themselves. It was the routine, the community, the simple pleasure of a summer evening spent cheering for something. Seeing the players adapt, showing up with grit and determination despite the unusual circumstances, was surprisingly inspiring. It reminded me that resilience isn't about avoiding setbacks, but about finding a way to play on, even when the field looks completely different.
