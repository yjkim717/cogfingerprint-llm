## Remember That Feeling? The Pacers and the Crushing Weight of Expectation

Do you ever have a sports memory that just *stings*? For me, it’s the 2014 Indiana Pacers. They were poised, seemingly unstoppable, a lock for the Eastern Conference title. Then… nothing. A shocking collapse against the Heat. It wasn't just a loss; it was the shattering of hope. It’s a reminder that even the most talented teams can crumble under pressure, and sometimes, the journey matters more than the destination.
