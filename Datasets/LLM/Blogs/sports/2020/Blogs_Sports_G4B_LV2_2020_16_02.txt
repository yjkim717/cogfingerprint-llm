**The Unexpected Shift – Remembering the Fulmer Cup**

It’s funny how a single announcement can suddenly make you think back to a whole era of a sport. I was just reading about the changes to the Fulmer Cup, and it brought back a flood of memories from 2020. Remember how everyone was scrambling with those crazy scheduling shifts? It felt like college football was just… trying to figure things out. 

The “split season” idea, especially with separate championships, felt like a huge adjustment. It wasn't about the glory of *the* championship, but about just getting back to playing.  Honestly, it felt a little chaotic, but also strangely hopeful.  Like we were all just trying to find our footing after a wild year.  It’s a reminder that even in the world of college football, things change, and sometimes, the beauty is in the adaptation.
