"Stepping onto the court in 2020, I was determined to push through the pandemic's limitations. As an avid badminton player, the circuit breaker restrictions had taken a toll on my training routine. Yet, it became a catalyst for self-reflection. I began to appreciate the mental resilience required in sports, mirroring life's challenges. The court became a haven, where I could clear my mind and focus on the game. Through badminton, I learned to adapt, persevere, and find joy in the simple act of playing, even in uncertain times."
