The 2020 college football season was like no other. The COVID-19 pandemic had thrown a wrench into the traditional schedule, leaving fans and organizers scrambling for a solution. In response, the Fulmer Cup committee made a bold move - introducing a 'split' season. This meant that instead of one champion in each award category, there would be two. At first, it seemed like a necessary evil, but as the season progressed, it became clear that this unconventional approach had its own unique charm. The split season allowed for a more nuanced celebration of talent, acknowledging the different challenges and circumstances faced by teams in each half of the season. As we look back, it's clear that the Fulmer Cup's adaptability in the face of uncertainty was a testament to the resilience of college football.
