## The Empty Stands and the Quiet Victory

It's strange, isn’t it? This whole year. 2020. Remember the roar of the crowd? The electric anticipation before a big game? Feels like a lifetime ago. I miss it. I *really* miss it.

I’ve always been a sports fan – a die-hard, through thick and thin, kind of fan. My dad took me to my first baseball game when I was barely tall enough to see over the railing, and the smell of hot dogs and the crack of the bat are permanently etched into my memory. But this year… this year has been different.

Watching games without the energy of the fans felt… hollow. The replays kept showing those vacant stadiums, and it just amplified the weirdness of everything. We were all trying to find normalcy where we could, and for some, that was tuning in to the games.

But even in the silence, there were moments of brilliance. Seeing the Dodgers finally clinch the World Series felt… poignant, somehow. A small victory in a year that felt like one giant, collective loss. It wasn't the same celebration, no hugs from strangers, no chants echoing through the stands. But it was still a win. 

Maybe it taught me something about appreciating the little things, the quiet moments of joy that can still exist even when the world feels upside down. And, honestly, I’m holding onto that feeling, hoping for the day we can all be back in those stands, cheering together again.
