As a lifelong Warriors fan, watching the D’Angelo Russell trade unfold in 2020 left me with mixed feelings. Sure, we got Andrew Wiggins and a future first-rounder, but for a team built to win now, did we sacrifice too much? I keep asking myself: was this the best return? Wiggins, for all his athleticism, has never been the picture of efficiency, and that draft pick feels like a distant promise. In a win-now window, you need immediate impact. It’s hard not to wonder if a different deal could have kept our championship flame burning a little brighter, a little sooner.
