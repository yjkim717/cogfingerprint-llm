>## The West is Wild (and Not Tanking!)

Remember the whispers last spring? Some folks thought a few Western Conference teams might "tank" – intentionally lose games – for a better draft pick. But looking around now, heading into the 2020 offseason, it seems those predictions were way off. The West is *stacked*. Seriously, almost everyone's got playoff aspirations. 

The competition is going to be brutal. Every game matters. It's going to be a fascinating few months watching teams jostle for position and fight for a spot in the postseason. Bring on the drama!
