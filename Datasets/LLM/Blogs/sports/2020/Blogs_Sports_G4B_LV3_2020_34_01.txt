**The Ghosts of 2019: Why Those LSU Games Still Haunt Me**

2020 was… a year, wasn’t it? Football felt like a distant dream sometimes, a flickering hope amidst the uncertainty. But there’s one particular set of games from 2019 that kept circling back in my mind – the ones dominated by LSU, Ohio State, and Alabama. I was completely consumed by the Fei Ratings that year, obsessively tracking those top 100 rankings. 

It wasn't just about the wins and losses, you know? It was about *how* they won. LSU’s sheer offensive firepower against some of the toughest defenses was mesmerizing. Ohio State’s methodical, strategic approach felt like a masterclass in football. And Alabama, well, Alabama was just…Alabama. 

What struck me most wasn’t just the final scores, but the efficiency – the way these teams maximized every play, every possession. It made me think about the little things: the precise blocking, the quick reads, the relentless drive. 

Looking back, those 2019 games felt like a snapshot of peak performance. They highlighted the incredible talent and strategic brilliance within those programs. It’s funny how a single season, a collection of ratings and box scores, can linger and remind you of the beauty and complexity of the game.  Do you ever find yourself revisiting moments like that, wishing you could just step back into the feeling of watching greatness unfold?
