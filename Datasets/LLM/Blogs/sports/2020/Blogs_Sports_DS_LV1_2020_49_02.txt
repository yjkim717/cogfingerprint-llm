### The Ghosts in Our Rankings

Remember the feeling of waiting for a birthday as a kid? The agonizing stretch of a single year? In the fight game, that same stretch can feel like a lifetime.

It’s 2020, and like everyone else, I’ve spent more time than ever staring at screens. Lately, my eyes keep catching on the UFC rankings. You see a name, a former terror in their division, and you get a jolt of excitement—until you realize they haven’t thrown a punch in 18 months. They’re a ghost, haunting a spot that a hungry, active fighter has bled to earn.

It just doesn’t sit right. Rankings should be a living, breathing leaderboard, not a hall of fame. If a fighter is inactive for over a year, their name should gracefully fade from the list. It’s not a punishment; it’s a reality check. It clears the path for the athletes who are showing up, building momentum, and giving us something to talk about every fight night.

And what about an inactive champion? This is where the interim title needs to be more than just a placeholder. It should be a mandate. If the king or queen is sidelined long-term, crown an interim champ and let them defend that belt. It keeps the division moving, creates real stakes, and honors the fighters who are actually competing.

In a year where so much feels frozen in place, our sports rankings shouldn’t be. Let’s reward activity, not tenure. The future of these divisions depends on it.
