Looking back at that 2020 D'Angelo Russell trade, I can't help but feel the Warriors left something on the table. Swapping him for Andrew Wiggins and a pick felt underwhelming, especially seeing what a star like Jrue Holiday commanded elsewhere. It was a classic case of selling at a perceived low. Hindsight is 20/20, of course, but that first-round pick stings when you consider the potential missed opportunity. Sometimes, the best trades are the ones you don't make, or at least the ones where you hold out for more.
