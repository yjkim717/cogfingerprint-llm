I still remember the 2020 marathon I trained for, only to have my progress halted by a nagging injury. As I crossed the start line, feeling defeated, I couldn't help but think of all the times I'd pushed through pain and discomfort to reach my goals. But this time was different - this time, I had to listen to my body. It was a tough pill to swallow, but I realized that taking a step back and prioritizing recovery was the bravest thing I could do. As I watched the world slow down around me due to the pandemic, I began to see that sometimes, the hardest battles are the ones we fight within. I learned to be kinder to myself, to acknowledge that setbacks are a part of the journey, and that sometimes, the greatest victory is simply showing up.
