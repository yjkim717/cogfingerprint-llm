**Blog Post: Project Atlas – A Retro Gaming Experiment**

Okay, so I’ve been tinkering with this idea for a while, and I’m finally ready to share it: “Internet Atlas.” It’s a completely new game mode designed around the feeling of navigating a vast, interconnected world – like those old Internet Explorer atlases we used to pore over. Seriously, remember those? The clunky interfaces, the endless scrolling, the slightly terrifying feeling of discovering something new?

I’m aiming for a deliberately slow, methodical pace, a progress bar perpetually hovering around 95% (because, let’s be honest, that was always a tease!). The core concept is exploration and discovery, fueled by a sense of retro tech. It’s a bit of a crazy project, pulling inspiration from different IE versions, but I think there’s something really compelling about revisiting that almost-lost digital landscape. More details to come!

**The Quiet of the Season**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020. The year everything felt… paused. I’d been training for the marathon all spring, feeling that familiar adrenaline rush of pushing my limits. Then, suddenly, everything shut down. The races were canceled, the gyms closed. 

I kept running, just for me, early in the mornings before the world fully woke up. It wasn't about the finish line anymore; it was about the quiet rhythm of my feet on the pavement, the feeling of pushing through.  It was a strange kind of victory, a personal accomplishment in a year that felt defined by loss.  There’s a melancholy beauty to that, I think.  A reminder that sometimes, the most important races are the ones we run alone.
