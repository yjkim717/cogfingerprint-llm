**The Ghosts of Sanctions and the Promise of the Big 12**

It’s hard to shake the feeling that 2020 was a year of… adjustments, wasn’t it? And as I was diving into the preseason previews for college basketball, specifically the Big 12, that feeling lingered. You can’t really talk about this season without acknowledging the shadow cast by Oklahoma State’s NCAA sanctions. It’s a complicated situation, and honestly, a little heartbreaking for fans.

But even with that cloud hanging over them, there’s a real buzz around the conference. I’ve been spending hours poring over rosters, scouting key players, and trying to predict which teams will rise to the top. The Big 12 always delivers drama, and 2020 feels ripe for it. 

There’s a palpable sense of potential, a feeling that Baylor is still the team to beat, but with Kansas and Texas Tech looking incredibly strong, and some exciting young talent emerging from teams like TCU and West Virginia, it’s going to be a dogfight for every single game. 

It makes you think about the unpredictable nature of sports, doesn’t it? How a single event can completely shift the landscape.  This season, it’s not just about the wins and losses; it’s about navigating the complexities and finding the good amidst the challenges.  I'm genuinely excited to see how all these teams adapt and, ultimately, how the storylines unfold. Let's go Big 12!
