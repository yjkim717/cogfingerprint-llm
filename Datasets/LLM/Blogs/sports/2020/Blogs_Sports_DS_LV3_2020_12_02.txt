The year 2020 forced us all to find new rhythms, and for me, that meant lacing up my running shoes instead of heading to the gym. At first, my solitary jogs felt aimless, just putting one foot in front of the other. But then I started focusing on my breath, finding a steady cadence like a punchy kick drum cutting through a melodic house track. That consistent beat became my anchor. It wasn't about speed or distance anymore; it was about the clean, repetitive motion, processing the stress of the world with every step. In the quiet streets, I found a new kind of team sportâ€”the one between my mind, my body, and the road ahead.
