"As I navigated Sporcle's minefield quizzes in June 2020, I realized that earning badges had become too easy. With repeated attempts, I could rack up points, but it didn't feel truly earned. I think the platform should count unique plays, not total attempts, to make badges more meaningful. This change would add a new level of challenge, making achievements feel more satisfying. It's a simple tweak that could elevate the entire experience."
