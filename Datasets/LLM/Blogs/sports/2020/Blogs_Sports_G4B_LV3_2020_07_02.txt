Input: A player is struggling to receive rewards from Trials of Osiris.
Output: There’s something incredibly frustrating about chasing a goal, only to have it slip through your fingers. It’s like that feeling when you’re inches from the finish line in a race – a missed opportunity, a tiny glitch. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a similar frustration in Destiny 2, battling a persistent bug preventing me from claiming my Trials rewards. It's a reminder that even in the digital world, persistence and a little luck are key.
