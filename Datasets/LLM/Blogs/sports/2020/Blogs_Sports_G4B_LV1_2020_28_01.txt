**The Unexpected Shot**

It’s weird, right? 2020. Everything felt… off-kilter. My college basketball team, the Wildcats, were battling for a tournament bid, and I was feeling completely lost. I’d been stuck on the bench for most of the season, a frustrating spectator.  

Coach kept telling us to “find our role,” but I honestly felt like I wasn’t *doing* anything. Then, with about a week left, we were down by five with seconds on the clock. The star point guard went down with an injury, and suddenly, *I* was in. 

It wasn't graceful. I missed the first shot. But then, I caught the rebound and, almost without thinking, took a deep breath and launched a three. Swish.  We rallied, won the game, and made the tournament. 

It felt like a sudden shift, like the rules of the game had changed. Just like that clarification about the CARES Act – a new way of applying. Sometimes, you just have to step up when you’re called upon, even if it feels completely unexpected.
