As I laced up my running shoes in the spring of 2020, I couldn't help but feel a sense of community with fellow runners. We shared a common goal - to stay fit and healthy amidst the pandemic. I started sharing my running photos on our community forum, and it sparked a wave of camaraderie. Soon, I was inspired by others' stories and routes. The forum became a space where we motivated and celebrated each other, proving that even in isolation, running can connect us.
