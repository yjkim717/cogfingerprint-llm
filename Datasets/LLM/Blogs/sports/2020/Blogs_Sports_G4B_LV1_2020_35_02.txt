**Chasing Light: A 2020 Running Memory**

It’s funny how a little online challenge can pull you back to a specific moment. I stumbled across a Reddit Photo Friday thread from 2020 – a running photo contest – and it instantly triggered a memory. I’d been relentlessly pounding the pavement during that winter, battling a brutal windchill on my usual route, determined to just *move*. 

The photos were incredible, full of grit and determination, and it made me realize how much I was focusing on the distance, not the beauty of the run itself. The winner, a shot of a runner silhouetted against a snowy landscape, really hit home. It wasn't about winning; it was about capturing that feeling of pushing through.  It reminded me to slow down, appreciate the light, and find joy in the simple act of putting one foot in front of the other.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
