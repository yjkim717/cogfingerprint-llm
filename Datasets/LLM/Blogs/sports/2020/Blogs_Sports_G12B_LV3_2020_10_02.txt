## The Unexpected Lesson from a Cancelled Season (2020)

Remember 2020? The year everything felt… paused? For me, it was the year my university soccer season vanished. Just like that. One minute we were training, the next, the news dropped. Disappointment was an understatement. Honestly, I felt lost. Soccer wasn't just a hobby; it was a huge part of my identity, a community, a stress reliever. 

But something unexpected happened. Without the constant pressure of games and practices, I rediscovered other passions. I started painting, something I'd abandoned years ago. I reconnected with friends I’d lost touch with. It wasn't the season I wanted, but it forced me to look inward, to explore beyond the field. And you know what? I realized I’m more than just a soccer player. Sometimes, the cancellations are where the real growth happens.
