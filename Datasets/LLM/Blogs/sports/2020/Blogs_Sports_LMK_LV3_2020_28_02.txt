As I reflect on my 20-year fundraising journey, I realize that enhancing my skills in planned giving is like training for a marathon - it requires dedication and a well-planned strategy. Just as athletes rely on a strong support team, nonprofit professionals can benefit from guidance and certification to elevate their annual giving programs. In 2020, amidst the challenges of a pandemic, I turned to professional development opportunities to stay ahead of the game. By doing so, I'm not only growing professionally but also helping my institution score big in the long run.
