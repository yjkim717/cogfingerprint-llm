The year 2020 forced us all to find new rhythms, and for me, that meant trading the roar of a stadium for the quiet hum of a solitary morning run. I used to thrive on team sports, the electric energy of a crowd. But pounding the pavement day after day, I discovered a different kind of strength. It wasn't about competition; it was a conversation with myself, a meditation in motion. I learned that the most important opponent you ever face is the one in your own head, and sometimes, the greatest victory is simply lacing up your shoes and getting out the door.
