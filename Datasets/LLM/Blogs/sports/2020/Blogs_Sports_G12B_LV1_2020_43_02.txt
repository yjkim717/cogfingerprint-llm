## Finding My Ground: More Than Just a Game

Remember back in March 2020, when everything just… stopped? My local women’s basketball league was one of the first things to be sidelined. It felt jarring, honestly. Basketball wasn't just a hobby; it was a space where I felt strong, capable, and connected. 

Being sidelined got me thinking a lot about strength, not just physical. We spend so much time talking about legislation and safety, and it’s important, absolutely. But lately, I’ve been reflecting on the tangible confidence I gain from pushing my physical limits, from learning to move with purpose. 

That feeling of groundedness, of knowing you can respond, translates to so much more than just the court. It’s a quiet resilience. Maybe true prevention isn’t just about laws, but about building that resilience within ourselves. It’s a thought I’m still grappling with, but one that feels important.
