As I scrolled through my sports podcast feed in 2020, I couldn't help but wonder: are Bill Simmons and SVP still BFFs? The NFL commentary duo had us hooked with their sharp insights, and I think they'd kill it together on a podcast. Imagine the hilarious banter and sports gambling hot takes! Simmons' humor paired with Russillo's play-by-play expertise would be a match made in heaven. Has anyone brought them together yet?
