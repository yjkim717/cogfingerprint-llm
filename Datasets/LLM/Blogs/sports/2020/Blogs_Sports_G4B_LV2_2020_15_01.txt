**That Feeling When a Song Changes Everything**

2020 felt… strange, right? Like everyone was searching for a little bit of magic. I remember discovering “Skin Tight” by The Dø after hearing it in *The Old Guard* soundtrack. Suddenly, everything felt a little brighter. It was like stumbling upon a hidden gem. 

It made me think about how music can completely shift your perspective.  Like finding a forgotten sports memory – a perfectly executed play, a winning shot – that ‘dusts off’ a whole season of feelings.  It’s wild, isn't it?
