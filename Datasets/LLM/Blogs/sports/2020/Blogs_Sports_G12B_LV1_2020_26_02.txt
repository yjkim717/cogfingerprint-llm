## What If? The Thunder's 2019-20 Season

Remember the 2019-20 Oklahoma City Thunder? It felt…turbulent. Injuries, roster changes, a constant sense of uncertainty. They finished with a respectable 44 wins, but watching them play, you just *knew* there was more there. What if Chris Paul hadn't battled those nagging injuries? What if the young guys, like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, had stayed healthy all year? It’s a frustrating hypothetical, but I truly believe a fully healthy Thunder squad could have pushed for a significantly higher win total. A real "what if?" season.
