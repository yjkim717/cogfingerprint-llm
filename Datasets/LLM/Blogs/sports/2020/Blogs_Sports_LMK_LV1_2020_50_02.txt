As I hung up my cleats in 2020, I couldn't help but think about my music streaming struggles. I'd just migrated from Google Play Music to YouTube Music, but sorting artists alphabetically on the web interface was a nightmare. Just like a fumbled pass, it was frustrating. I longed for the simplicity of my old playlist. Has anyone else experienced this? Now, my sports days are behind me, but the music battle rages on.
