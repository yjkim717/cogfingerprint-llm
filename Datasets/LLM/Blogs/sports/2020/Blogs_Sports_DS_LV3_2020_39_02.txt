The year 2020 was supposed to be my year. After months of disciplined saving, I’d finally secured the financing for my dream road bike—a sleek, carbon-fiber machine I’d researched for what felt like forever. I had my pre-approval letter from the credit union in my back pocket, a tangible symbol of my commitment. I felt prepared, responsible, and ready.

But walking into the local bike dealership, that confidence evaporated. Despite my pre-approval, the salesperson insisted they had to run their own credit check. "It's just our process," he said with a shrug. It felt like a betrayal. Here I was, a loyal customer ready to make a purchase, and the process was questioning the financial responsibility I’d already proven. That moment of friction, that lack of trust, soured the entire experience. It made me question my loyalty to the brand I’d been so excited about.

It’s a small thing, but in a year where control felt so elusive, that moment at the dealership was a stark reminder that sometimes, the biggest hurdles aren't the mountains you plan to climb, but the unnecessary barriers put in your path before you even begin.
