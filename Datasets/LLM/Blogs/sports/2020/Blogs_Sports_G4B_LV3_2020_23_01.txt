**The Score vs. The Sweat**

Remember watching the NBA playoffs in 2020? The commentators painted this incredibly dramatic picture – every possession, every timeout – but it felt… distant. As a huge fan, I realized the highlight reels rarely capture the sheer *exhaustion* and raw emotion of being a player. It’s a totally different perspective, isn’t it?  The edited score versus the sweat, the pressure, and the quiet moments of doubt. Makes you appreciate the game – and the people playing it – a whole lot more.
