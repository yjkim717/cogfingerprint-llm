## Remember the 2014 Pacers? A Collapse That Still Stings

Do you ever get caught down a rabbit hole of sports history? Lately, I've been thinking about the 2014 Indiana Pacers. They were *so* good in the regular season, dominating the Eastern Conference. Then, after the All-Star break? It felt like a different team. A complete unraveling in the playoffs. It's a stark reminder that regular season success doesn't guarantee anything, and sometimes, a team can justâ€¦ fall apart. Anyone else remember that frustrating collapse?
