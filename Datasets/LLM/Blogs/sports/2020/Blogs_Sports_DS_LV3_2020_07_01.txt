The 2020 sports hiatus left me craving competition, but not as a playerâ€”I wanted to be coached. Hard. I imagined legendary socialist coaches like Bill Shankly or Phil Jackson pushing me, using team dynamics as metaphors for discipline. "Your defense is a broken supply chain," they'd bark during drills, turning every missed play into a lesson in collective responsibility. It wasn't about winning; it was the humbling pursuit of excellence, being broken down to be rebuilt stronger, together. A true team player, forged through shared struggle.
