Input: Autocompletion, search engine, annoyance, error page, removal
Output: Remember 2020? The internet felt…sticky. I was wrestling with Google’s autocomplete – a single, stubbornly wrong suggestion haunting my searches. It was maddening! Like an error page refusing to load, I’d delete it, only for it to return the next day. It’s a tiny frustration, but it perfectly captured that year’s feeling of being constantly corrected, constantly battling the digital world.
