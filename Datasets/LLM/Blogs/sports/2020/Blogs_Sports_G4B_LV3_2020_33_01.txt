**The Ghosts of Detroit: A Weird NFL Obsession**

Let’s be honest, as football fans, we love a good narrative. A dominant team, a Cinderella story – it’s what keeps us glued to the screen. But sometimes, you stumble onto a story that just… lingers.  For me, it’s the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions. 

I watched it unfold in 2020, a frustrating, almost surreal repeat of the past four years. The Packers would *win* the series against Detroit, yet somehow, consistently let the lead slip away. It wasn’t a dominant victory; it felt like a near miss, a ghost of a win. 

There’s something unsettling about it, isn’t there? It’s more than just bad luck. It’s a reminder that in sports – and maybe in life – sometimes the most familiar patterns are the most stubbornly resistant to change.  It makes you wonder about the unseen factors, the tiny moments that shift the balance.  A strange, persistent puzzle to ponder, even years later.
