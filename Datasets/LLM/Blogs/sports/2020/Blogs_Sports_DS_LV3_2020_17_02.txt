The driving range felt lonelier than ever in 2020. My new driver wasn't the magic fix I'd hoped for, and my coach's advice echoed in my head: "Lessons, not equipment." But with social distancing, traditional coaching was out. So, I tried something new: video-recorded sessions.

I’d film my swing, send it off, and receive detailed feedback. At first, it felt impersonal. But watching my own form, over and over, I started seeing the flaws myself—the subtle hip twist, the rushed backswing. It became a partnership with my distant coach. I wasn't just being told what to do; I was learning to see. Sometimes, the best progress comes from looking at yourself from a new angle.
