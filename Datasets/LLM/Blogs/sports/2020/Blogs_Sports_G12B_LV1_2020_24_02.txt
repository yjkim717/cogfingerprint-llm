Remember the strange, truncated baseball season of 2020? Played amidst the pandemic, it feltâ€¦different. No roaring crowds, just the crack of the bat echoing in near silence. Yet, watching the Dodgers finally clinch the World Series felt unexpectedly poignant. It wasn't just a win; it was a symbol of perseverance, a small victory in a year that desperately needed one. A reminder that even in the face of so much, a little bit of normalcy, and a little bit of hope, could still shine through.
