## The Simple Joy of a Head-to-Head

Remember the thrill of challenging someone face-to-face? It's a feeling that's become a little rarer these days, hasn't it? I recently dusted off *Jump Force*, hoping for a classic local 1v1 with my brother. Turns out, getting keyboard versus controller to work smoothly was a bit of a puzzle! It highlighted how much I miss that pure, competitive energy – just two players, a screen, and a whole lot of playful trash talk. It’s a simple joy, and one worth seeking out.
