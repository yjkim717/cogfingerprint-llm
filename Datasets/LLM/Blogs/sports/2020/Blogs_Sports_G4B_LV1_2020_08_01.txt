**The Ghosts of ‘94: Why the Eagles’ Rise and Fall Still Haunts Me**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single season can stick with you? I was just thinking about the Philadelphia Eagles this week, and I couldn’t shake the memory of the 1994 team. They were *incredible* – 7-2, looking like they were going to run the league. Then… nothing. A complete collapse, and they missed the playoffs. 

It’s a brutal reminder that momentum is a fickle thing in football. You can have everything going your way, and one bad stretch can derail it all. Honestly, it’s a story that still gets me – a cautionary tale about believing too early, and the heartbreaking speed at which a season can unravel.  It makes you appreciate every win, doesn’t it? #NFL #Eagles #Football #1994
