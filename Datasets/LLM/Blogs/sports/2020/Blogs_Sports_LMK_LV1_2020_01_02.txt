As I watched my kid unpack his birthday Pokémon cards in July 2020, I was reminded of my own childhood obsession with sports. Like many kids, I spent hours trading cards, reading stats, and playing in the backyard with friends. As a parent now, I'm seeing a similar enthusiasm in my child, and it's amazing to think about the life skills he's developing through his love of Pokémon. Whether it's strategy, critical thinking, or social skills, the Pokémon Trading Card Game is providing a fun and engaging way for him to learn and grow. Just as I cherished my own sports memories, I'm excited to see where his Pokémon journey takes him - and maybe even share some of his favorite cards with him along the way.
