The email came through on a humid August afternoon, the kind where the air feels thick with possibility. I was sitting on my worn-out sofa, cleats kicked off beside me, mentally running through plays for what should have been our first preseason game. Then I saw the subject line: “U Sports 2020 Season Update.”

My heart sank before I even clicked.

We all knew the pandemic was rewriting the rules of everything. We’d been doing Zoom workouts for months, passing footballs in empty parks just to feel the familiar sting of the laces. We were prepared for cancellations, for delays, for a hollowed-out season. But what we weren’t prepared for was the asterisk.

The decision to cancel the season was one thing. The decision to exclude any player turning 25? That was a gut punch dressed up as policy.

I remember looking around our group chat that day. The silence was louder than any locker room roar. There was Mike, our center, who’d worked night shifts to pay for an extra year of classes just to play his final season. He turned 25 in October. His dream of one last snap, one final chance to be scouted, evaporated with a single clause.

This wasn’t just about lost games; it was about lost futures. It felt like the league we’d bled for was telling us that our dedication had an expiration date. That the extra years we’d poured in—overcoming injuries, academic hurdles, personal setbacks—somehow made us less deserving of the chance to finish what we started.

The backlash was swift, and it was raw. Coaches we respected, mentors who’d taught us about resilience, resigned in protest. They stood with us, their actions shouting what we all felt: this was about more than football. It was about fairness. It was about recognizing that an athlete’s journey isn’t a straight line.

In 2020, we were already losing so much—graduations, goodbyes, the simple comfort of a shared struggle on the field. This age cap felt like an institutional dismissal of our individual stories. It reduced complex lives to a number on a calendar.

Now, with talk of legal challenges hanging in the air, I can’t help but reflect on what we’re really fighting for. It’s not just a season. It’s the principle that you don’t penalize perseverance. That the clock on a dream shouldn’t be arbitrarily set by a committee.

That email may have taken away our season, but it ignited something else: a fierce, collective understanding that some things are worth standing up for, long after the final whistle blows.
