**Remembering the 2018 Sox – A Little Bit of Frustration**

It’s funny how certain baseball moments stick with you, right? I was just thinking about the 2018 Red Sox – a team that felt *so* close to the promised land.  I remember obsessing over those runners on second, watching Mookie Betts and others with a slashing average that just wasn’t quite translating into big hits in the playoffs. 

It’s a reminder that even in a dominant season, baseball is a brutal game of inches.  Those close calls, those missed opportunities... they linger.  Makes you appreciate the wins even more, doesn't it? #RedSox #MLB #BaseballMemories
