Subject: Verizon Voicemail Alert – Be Careful!

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share a weird and potentially concerning experience. I got a voicemail today claiming my phone number was listed as an “alternate” on someone’s Verizon account. The voice sounded vaguely automated, and it was really unsettling. It felt like a classic scam tactic – trying to create a sense of urgency and make you worry about your account. 

Verizon has warned about similar calls, so I’ve immediately contacted them to verify. Don’t blindly trust voicemails, especially if they’re asking for personal information or trying to scare you. Always double-check directly with the company, and if something feels off, it probably is!  Let's stay vigilant.

**The Quiet of the Empty Stadium – 2020**

It’s strange to think about how different 2020 felt, isn't it?  I used to spend almost every weekend at the baseball stadium, glued to my seat, cheering on the [Insert Team Name Here]. The roar of the crowd, the smell of hot dogs, the electric energy - it was my escape.  But in March, everything shut down.

Suddenly, the stadium was… silent.  It was eerie.  I started going alone, just to walk around the grounds, to remind myself of the joy it used to bring. It felt like a ghost of a memory.  

Watching the games on TV just wasn’t the same.  It highlighted how much we take the shared experience for granted.  It was a reminder that sometimes, the loudest moments are the ones we miss most.  I’m looking forward to the day we can all be back together, shoulder-to-shoulder, yelling at the refs again.
