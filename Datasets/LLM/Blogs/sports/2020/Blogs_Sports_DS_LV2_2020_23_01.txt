As a lifelong football fan, watching the 2020 NBA Bubble from my couch felt surreal. I saw the polished broadcasts, the dramatic finishes. But then I’d see a player’s Instagram story—just a quiet, empty arena. It hit me: we were consuming a narrative, while they were living a sterile, isolated reality. My "thrilling game" was their months of sacrifice. It forever changed how I see the sweat behind the screen.
