**Title: Untangling the CARES Act's Charitable Deduction: Is it Per Person or Per Return?**

A new report from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has thrown a welcome, yet slightly confusing, wrinkle into the CARES Act's popular "above-the-line" charitable deduction. Many taxpayers have happily taken advantage of the provision allowing for a $300 deduction for cash contributions, even if they don't itemize. But a critical question has emerged from the fine print: is that $300 per individual, or is it $300 per tax filing unit?

For a married couple filing jointly, the distinction is significant. If the deduction is per person, they could potentially deduct a total of $600 for their combined charitable giving in 2020. If it's per tax return, they are capped at a single $300 deduction. The language in the initial legislation was ambiguous, leading many tax professionals and donors to assume the more conservative, per-return interpretation.

However, the new JCT report appears to clarify that the deduction was indeed intended to be $300 per individual. This is a crucial clarification for households with dual incomes and a shared commitment to philanthropy. While this interpretation still needs to be formally adopted by the IRS, it suggests that many generous taxpayers may have more room to support their favorite causes and receive a corresponding tax benefit than they initially thought. For fundraisers and donors alike, this is a promising development worth watching closely.

**The Empty Stadium**

I remember the roar. It was a physical thing, a wave of sound that hit you in the chest when the game-winning shot swished through the net. In 2020, the silence is what’s deafening.

I clicked on a basketball game the other night, and it felt… strange. The squeak of sneakers on the polished court was crystal clear. I could hear every word the coaches shouted from the bench. The players’ heavy breaths after a fast break were picked up by the sensitive microphones. It was pure, uncut sport, but it was missing its soul—the fans.

We weren’t just spectators; we were part of the game. Our collective groans, our eruptive cheers, our anxious energy—it was the soundtrack to the drama unfolding on the court. Now, watching these incredible athletes compete in a bubble, surrounded by cardboard cutouts and piped-in crowd noise, I realized something. The game isn't just about the players. It’s a shared experience, a communal heartbeat. I can’t wait for the day we can all come together again and provide that living, breathing, roaring soundtrack. The game needs it, and frankly, so do we.
