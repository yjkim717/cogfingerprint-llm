It’s funny how numbers can tell one story, but the feeling tells another. As a Packers fan in 2020, I look at that 4-4 split with the Lions and think, "Okay, we’re even." But then you see it: we’ve only led for about 54 minutes total across those eight games. Fifty-four minutes. That’s barely a single game’s worth of breathing room.

It makes every win feel fragile, like we’re clinging to a narrow ledge. Even when we come out on top, it’s often by the skin of our teeth. There’s no room for arrogance in this rivalry—just white-knuckle hope and the humbling truth that a game can turn in a heartbeat. It keeps you grateful, and honestly, it keeps you coming back.
