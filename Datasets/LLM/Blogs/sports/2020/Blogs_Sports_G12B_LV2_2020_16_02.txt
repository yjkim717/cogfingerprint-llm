>Okay, here's a reflective blog post draft based on the provided information and instructions. I've aimed for a conversational tone and a touch of personal reflection, fitting the 2020 context.  I've included a title suggestion too.

**Title: Two Champions? College Football's Wild 2020 and the Fulmer Cup**

Remember back in 2020? Everything felt…off. The world was shifting under our feet, and college football, well, it was trying its best to play on amidst all the chaos. Game cancellations, postponements, and the constant worry about safety – it was a season unlike any other.

And it led to something pretty unique: two Fulmer Cup champions. For those unfamiliar, the Fulmer Cup is this awesome tradition in the Ohio Valley Conference, a trophy awarded to the best team in the conference based on a complex formula that considers margin of victory.

This year, because of the disrupted schedules, they decided to recognize *both* teams who had strong showings – those who played their season in the fall and those whose seasons were pushed to the spring. It felt…right, somehow. Acknowledging the bizarre circumstances, celebrating effort despite the challenges.

It wasn't the ideal way to crown a champion, but it was a testament to the resilience of these athletes and the ingenuity of the conference. It reminded me that sometimes, the most meaningful victories aren’t about the final score, but about persevering through the unexpected. And 2020 certainly delivered the unexpected, didn't it? Austin Peay was one of those champions, and it was a story worth celebrating.
