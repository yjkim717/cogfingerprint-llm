## The Quiet of the Court: Finding Focus in a Strange Year

Remember 2020? Everything felt…off. The world shrunk to our homes, and suddenly, my usual escape – basketball – was complicated. The local courts were closed, leagues suspended. It felt like another piece of normalcy had vanished.

I missed the thwack of the ball, the camaraderie, the sheer physical release. So, I started shooting hoops in my driveway. It wasn't the same, but it *was* something.  Just me, the hoop, and the echo of a year that demanded a quiet focus.  It became a weirdly meditative space.  No cheering crowds, no pressure. Just the rhythm of the bounce, the arc of the shot, and a small, personal victory with each swish. It wasn't about winning, it was about finding a center amidst the chaos.
