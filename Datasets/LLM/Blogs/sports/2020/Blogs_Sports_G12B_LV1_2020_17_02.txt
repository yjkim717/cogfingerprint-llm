## The Range, the Screen, and the Quest for a Better Drive

It’s 2020, and like a lot of folks, I’ve been spending more time staring at screens than I probably should. So, naturally, I started wondering if that could translate to my golf game. I’ve been battling a frustrating slice off the tee for ages, and the idea of analyzing my driver swing with video recording seemed… appealing. No awkwardness, just pure data.

But then I spent an afternoon at the driving range, watching a guy absolutely *crush* balls under the guidance of a golf instructor. The immediate feedback, the subtle adjustments… it was a different level. 

I'm stuck in a bit of a debate now. Is the instant feedback of an in-person lesson, the feel of a coach’s hand on your posture, truly irreplaceable? Or can a meticulously analyzed video recording, combined with some online resources, deliver similar results? Maybe it’s a bit of both. I guess I'll be experimenting this fall!
