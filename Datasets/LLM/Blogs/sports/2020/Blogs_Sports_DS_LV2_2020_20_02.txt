Remember those endless lockdown days in 2020? My only “sport” was a frantic clickathon on Sporcle, trying to name all the countries. I must have played that minefield quiz a dozen times, chasing the "June Kaboom" badge. But it felt hollow. A fellow user’s idea hit home: badges should honor unique plays, not just repetition. It’s not about mindless grinding; it’s the genuine challenge, the first-time victory. A better game, and maybe a better lesson, too.
