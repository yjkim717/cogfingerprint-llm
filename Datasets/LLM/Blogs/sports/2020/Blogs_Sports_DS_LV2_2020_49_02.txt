### The Ghosts in the UFC Rankings

I was scrolling through the official UFC rankings the other day—a habit born from equal parts hope and frustration in 2020—and I had a weirdly profound thought. It felt less like a current roster and more like a digital graveyard.

Staring back at me were the names of champions and contenders who haven’t thrown a punch in over a year. In a world where a single weekend can change the entire landscape of a division, these frozen names feel like relics. It’s like having a map that still shows a city that’s already been washed away by the tide.

And 2020, man. What a year to make you think about inactivity. We all got a taste of what it’s like to be put on hold, our own lives and plans suspended indefinitely. That shared experience is why this issue with the rankings suddenly feels so personal. It’s not just about sport; it’s about fairness and momentum.

When a champion is sidelined, the entire division grinds to a halt. The number one contender is stuck running on a treadmill, and the hungry fighters bubbling up from underneath hit a glass ceiling. An interim title isn’t a participation trophy; it’s a necessity. It keeps the story moving. It gives us something to invest in *now*, not in some hypothetical future.

Letting an inactive fighter cling to a ranking spot does a disservice to everyone throwing down in the octagon every Saturday. It disrespects their risk, their sacrifice, and their momentum. The sport of MMA is a river, not a lake. It has to keep flowing.

Clearing out the ghosts from the rankings isn’t cruel; it’s a reset. It’s an acknowledgment that what you did 15 months ago matters, but what you’re doing *today* matters more. And if there’s one thing 2020 has taught us, it’s that standing still is no longer an option for any of us.
