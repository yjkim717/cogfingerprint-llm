Of course, here is a reflective blog post written from the perspective of a sports fan in 2020.

### The Year We Learned to Love the Waiting Game

I found it the other day, tucked behind a stack of cookbooks we never used: my 2020 Big 12 basketball preview. The one I’d scribbled on with the confidence of a TV analyst. “Kansas for the regular season,” it declared. “Texas Tech right there with them. And watch out for West Virginia in the conference tournament—they’re my dark horse.”

I remember writing that. It was February. The world was one thing, and then, in the blink of an eye, it became something entirely different. My “dark horse” never even got to the starting gate.

We talk a lot about the cancelled NCAA tournament, the empty arenas, and the “what-ifs” of March Madness. And rightfully so. It was a collective heartbreak for anyone who loves the drama of a bracket. But for me, the real pang of nostalgia hits when I think about the smaller stuff. The stuff my preseason predictions completely took for granted.

I miss the mid-week grind of a Kansas vs. Baylor game that felt like a Final Four matchup. I miss the sound of a full arena groaning in unison at a missed free throw. I miss the pointless, hilarious debates with friends at the bar about whether a player traveled—debates that felt so incredibly important in the moment. My predictions weren’t just about who would win; they were a placeholder for all the shared experiences we were about to have.

2020 taught me that my love for sports was never really about being right. It wasn’t about the final score at the top of the screen. It was about the texture of the season—the unexpected upsets that ruined my bracket, the breakout player I could claim I “saw coming,” and the sheer, unscripted joy of a game-winning buzzer-beater.

That crumpled preseason sheet isn’t a monument to my failed prognostications. It’s a receipt for a season of memories we never got to make. And now, as we tentatively welcome sports back, I find I don’t care who wins the conference. I just want to hear the roar of the crowd again. I want to feel that collective gasp. Because now I know, you don’t just miss the game. You miss the world that hums around it.
