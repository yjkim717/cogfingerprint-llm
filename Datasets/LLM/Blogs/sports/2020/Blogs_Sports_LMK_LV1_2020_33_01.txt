"As I looked back on the Packers-Lions matchups from 2016 to 2020, one trend stood out - the Lions' surprising ability to stay ahead. Despite being a long-term underdog, Detroit rarely trailed in these games, with Green Bay struggling to take the lead. In fact, the Packers often found themselves playing catch-up. It wasn't until the final whistle blew that the outcome was decided, with regulation time often ending in a nail-biter. The 2020 season series was no exception, with the teams trading blows and neither able to gain a clear advantage. A true testament to the competitiveness of the NFC North."
