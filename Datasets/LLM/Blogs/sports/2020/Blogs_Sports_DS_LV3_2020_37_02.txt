It’s 2020, and as a Rangers fan, I’ve been staring at our roster like a puzzle with too many of the same pieces. We’re stacked with promising right-handed defensemen—talented kids and steady veterans—but reliable lefties? They’re the missing piece.

It reminds me of trying to fit square pegs into round holes. You can force it, but it never feels quite right. Our prospect pool is deep, full of future stars, yet I can’t help but wonder: is it time to trade some of that potential for a proven, top-four LHD?

It’s a tough call, balancing tomorrow’s dreams with today’s needs. But in a season where every shift matters, finding that left-side stability could be what turns a hopeful roster into a contender.
