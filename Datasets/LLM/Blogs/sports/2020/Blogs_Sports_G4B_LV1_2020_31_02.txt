**The Spreadsheet Obsession: Why I Lost My Mind Over FPL in 2020**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2020 was weird. And for me, it was also the year I fully embraced (and subsequently lost) my sanity to Fantasy Premier League. I’d always dabbled, but this season, it became a full-blown obsession. 

I spent hours glued to spreadsheets, agonizing over price competition and trying to predict every single player’s value. Ten players, meticulously tracked – it felt vital! I’d shift my team based on the *slightest* rumour, convinced I held the key to FPL glory. 

Looking back, it’s a little embarrassing. I was so focused on the numbers, on the potential, that I completely missed the joy of watching the actual football.  It taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, the thrill is in the game itself, not the tactical maneuvering.  Anyone else feel this way?
