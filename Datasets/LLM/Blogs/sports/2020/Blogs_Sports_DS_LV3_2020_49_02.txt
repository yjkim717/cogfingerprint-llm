It’s 2020, and like many of you, I’ve spent more time than ever scrolling through sports news, clinging to any sense of normalcy. Lately, I’ve found myself staring at the UFC **mma rankings**, and something just doesn’t sit right. It’s like looking at a class photo where a few kids graduated years ago but are still hanging around.

Take a champion like Khabib or a top contender like Conor from a few years back. When a fighter has a year of **fighter inactivity**, what are those spots in the rankings even representing? Potential? Past glory? In a sport as brutal and fast-evolving as MMA, a year is a lifetime. New hungry fighters are climbing, putting it all on the line, while some big names are frozen in place on the list, their legacies secure but their current relevance fading.

I get it; it’s complicated. An **interim belt** is created for a reason—to keep a **weight class** moving when the champion is sidelined. But what about everyone else? If a fight gets booked and falls through, like with Tony and Khabib so many times, that’s one thing. But pure, unbooked inactivity? We need clearer **removal criteria**.

It’s about fairness and accuracy. That ranking spot is a beacon of opportunity. It should signal who is truly in the mix *right now*, not who was great in 2019. Keeping it real and current honors the athletes who are active and gives us fans a legitimate picture of the landscape. Because in 2020, more than any other year, we’ve learned that nothing is guaranteed, and standing still is the same as moving backward.
