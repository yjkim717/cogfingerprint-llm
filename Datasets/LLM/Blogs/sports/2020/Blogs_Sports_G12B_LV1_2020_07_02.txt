## The Agony of the Near Miss

Remember that Celtics-Heat playoff series in 2020? Man, it was brutal. We were *so* close to the Finals. Game 5 felt like it was right there for the taking, a couple of bounces going our way, and we were heading to the bubble. Instead, a string of frustrating turnovers and missed shots crushed our hopes. Itâ€™s a reminder that even when you put in the work, sometimes the game just doesn't reward you. Still stings a bit, honestly.
