"It's #PhotoFriday - a chance to share my favorite running snaps! As I scroll through my 2020 running route photos, I'm reminded of the miles logged during a challenging year. The solo runs, the early morning dark, and the race photos that captured my determination. I'm excited to see what runners share this week. Who's been on an inspiring run? Share your photos and you could be next week's winner! Let's celebrate the beauty of running together."
