**The Year We Missed the Game**

It feels weird even writing about 2020, doesn’t it? For me, it was the year I missed my son’s first little league season. We’d signed him up for the Cubs, picturing him rounding the bases, beaming with pride. Then… well, you know. 

I watched from our living room, a blurry screen my only connection to the action. I felt this sharp pang of disappointment – not just for him, but for myself. I’d imagined being there, cheering him on, sharing that first win. 

It made me realize how much we take for granted, how easily we get caught up in the *doing* and forget to just *be* present. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the greatest victories are the quiet ones, the moments of simply sharing an experience with the people you love.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or adjusting the length?
