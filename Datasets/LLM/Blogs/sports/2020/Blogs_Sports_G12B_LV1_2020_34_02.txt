>## The Scheduling Puzzle of '20

Remember 2020? Everything felt like a puzzle, right? College football was no different. With the pandemic forcing a shortened season, everyone was scrambling to find games. I was particularly fascinated watching the SEC try to squeeze in nine games. They were eyeing ACC rivals for those extra contests â€“ a fascinating cross-conference clash! But it was a logistical nightmare. Existing conference schedules, travel restrictions...it all tangled up. You'd read reports about potential matchups fall through, and it just highlighted how much behind-the-scenes work went into making the season happen at all. It was a chaotic, but ultimately memorable, year for college football.
