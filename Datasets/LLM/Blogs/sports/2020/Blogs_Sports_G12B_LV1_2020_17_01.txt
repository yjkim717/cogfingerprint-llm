>## The Empty Bleachers and a Quiet Kind of Hope

It’s weird, isn't it? How something as simple as a basketball game can become such a defining part of your routine. For years, Friday nights were all about the high school team – my son, Liam, was a starter. The roar of the crowd, the smell of popcorn, the nervous energy in the stands… it was a whole vibe. 

Then 2020 hit. Everything shifted. Suddenly, those Friday nights were empty. Bleachers silent, the court echoing. Liam, like everyone else, was grappling with so much. No games, no practices, just a lot of uncertainty.

At first, I missed the chaos. I missed the feeling of community, the shared excitement. But as the months wore on, I started to appreciate the quiet. It gave me a chance to really *see* Liam, not just the athlete, but the young man navigating a strange new world. 

And there’s a quiet kind of hope blooming now. A hope that things will return, that the roar will come back, but also a realization that some things, maybe the most important things, were already present all along.
