That night in 2020, the world saw a foregone conclusion. Mariya Agapova, the -1400 favorite, was destined to win. I remember watching, feeling that familiar ache for the underdog, Shana Dobson, a staggering +950 longshot. We’ve all felt that kind of stacked deck, right? When the odds are so heavy they feel personal. Then, the impossible happened. Shana didn’t just win; she made history. It was a raw, beautiful reminder that the heart of sport—and life—isn't found in the prediction, but in the glorious, unpredictable fight.
