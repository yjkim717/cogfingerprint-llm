## The Curious Case of the Packers and the Lead

Anyone else notice something strange about the Packers-Lions games lately? Seriously, over the last few years, it feels like Green Bay rarely *actually* leads. We get the early hype, the hopeful start, but then… it flips. It’s a bizarre dance of lead changes, a frustrating back-and-forth that leaves you questioning everything. 

It’s more than just a rivalry; it's become an odd statistical quirk. Even in 2020, with all the craziness happening in the world, this trend persisted. Makes you wonder what fuels this unpredictable dynamic, doesn't it? Perhaps it's just the Lions being… the Lions.
