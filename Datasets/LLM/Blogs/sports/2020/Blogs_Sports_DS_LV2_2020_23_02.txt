There’s something special about watching a seasoned quarterback step back into the pocket in 2020—a year that’s thrown us all a curveball. It reminds me of Tom Brady, no longer in Patriots red, blue, and silver, but leading the Buccaneers with that same old-school grit.

It feels like a nod to the purists among us. In an era of flashy highlights and social media buzz, there’s a raw honesty in seeing fundamentals win games. That methodical drive down the field, the trust in veteran instincts over pure athleticism—it’s a different kind of thrill.

It connects us to the heart of the sport, a game we fell in love with long before the noise. It’s proof that some legends aren’t just remembered; they’re still writing their story, and we’re lucky enough to have a front-row seat.
