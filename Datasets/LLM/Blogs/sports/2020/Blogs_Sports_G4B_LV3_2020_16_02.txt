**A Strange Kind of Victory**

Remember 2020? It felt…off, didn’t it? College football, like so much else, was a bizarre experiment. The Fulmer Cup – that’s what they called it – was a completely new way to decide a champion, splitting teams into separate divisions and crowning winners based on their own little seasons. 

Honestly, it felt a bit strange watching. There was no grand, unifying narrative, no shared journey towards a single goal. Instead, it was two separate races, and it made you think about what truly *defines* a victory. Was it just winning, or was it about the effort, the resilience, the unique story of a team navigating an incredibly unusual landscape? It was a reminder that sometimes, the most interesting moments come when the rules change.
