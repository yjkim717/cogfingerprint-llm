"Improving My Golf Game in 2020: Lessons or Tech? As I stepped onto the driving range this summer, I was torn between two paths to improve my golf game. Should I invest in private lessons with a seasoned instructor, or rely on the latest camera technology to analyze my swing? I've always been drawn to the instant feedback of cameras, but I've heard that a good instructor can offer personalized insights that tech can't match. As I weighed my options, I realized that the best approach might be a combination of both - after all, a little human guidance can go a long way in the golf shop and beyond."
