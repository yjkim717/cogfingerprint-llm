The COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill in 2020, and the sports world was no exception. As a huge sports fan, I was left feeling lost without the thrill of live games and the camaraderie of cheering alongside fellow fans. But as I reflected on the impact of the pandemic on sports, I began to appreciate the resilience and adaptability of athletes, teams, and organizers.

The CARES Act, passed in response to the pandemic, had a significant impact on various aspects of American life, including charitable giving. As someone who has always been passionate about giving back, I was intrigued by the Act's provisions related to tax deductions for charitable donations. However, I was also confused by conflicting interpretations of the Act's language, particularly those issued by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

As I navigated this uncertainty, I couldn't help but draw parallels between the sports world and the world of philanthropy. Just as athletes and teams had to adapt to new rules and circumstances, non-profits and donors had to navigate the changing landscape of charitable giving. And just as the sports world came together to support frontline workers and those affected by the pandemic, the philanthropic community rallied to provide vital support to those in need.

As I watched sports slowly return to the screen, I was heartened by the sense of community and resilience that defined the sports world in 2020. And I was reminded that, even in the most challenging times, there is always the potential for growth, adaptation, and positive impact â€“ both on and off the field.
