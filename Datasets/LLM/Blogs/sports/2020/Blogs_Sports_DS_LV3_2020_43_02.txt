Looking back on 2020, when the world felt unpredictable, I found an unexpected anchor in my weekly self-defense class. It wasn’t just about learning blocks or strikes—it was about reclaiming a sense of control. Each session reminded me that strength isn’t just physical; it’s the quiet confidence that comes from knowing you can protect yourself.

In a year when so much felt out of our hands, sports like these became more than exercise. They were a form of empowerment, a personal shield built through discipline and practice. For women especially, that feeling of readiness—of standing a little taller—is something no law can truly give. It’s something we build ourselves, one class at a time.
