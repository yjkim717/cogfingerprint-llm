**Title: The Year Everything Felt Shaky, Even College Football Rankings**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 was… something, wasn’t it? I’m not going to rehash *everything* – we all lived it. A global pandemic, a deeply divisive political climate, and just a general sense of uncertainty hanging over everything. It felt like the rug was constantly being pulled out from under us.  And somehow, even the reliably comforting world of college football felt… different.

I remember scrolling through the /r/CFB poll back in 2020, and it was almost surreal. There it was, in black and white: Alabama at number one. Solid, dependable Alabama. Then Notre Dame at two, and Ohio State rounding out the top three. On paper, a perfectly reasonable ranking. But the *feeling* surrounding it? Not so much.

It wasn't just the poll numbers themselves, though. It was the context. Games were being postponed, seasons were being shortened, and the entire landscape of the sport was shifting week to week. You’d see teams jump ten spots after a single, unexpectedly dominant win, and then tumble just as quickly after a close call. It felt like the rankings were less about merit and more about who managed to navigate the chaos.

I always loved the /r/CFB poll because it felt like a genuine reflection of the fan base, a collective pulse of opinion. But in 2020, it felt… frayed. Everyone was anxious. Everyone had an opinion, and those opinions changed faster than a quarterback’s reads.  I remember arguing with friends (safely, of course – Zoom debates were *the* thing) about whether a team deserved a certain ranking based on their strength of schedule, or whether a flashy win against a lesser opponent should carry more weight.

Looking back, it's almost charmingly naive to think we were so invested in these rankings when the world was quite literally falling apart. It highlights how much we lean on these traditions, these rituals, for a sense of normalcy. College football, for many of us, is a constant. It's Saturdays spent with friends, the roar of the crowd (or the muted cheers from our living rooms that year), and a shared sense of belonging.

And in 2020, when so much *wasn’t* constant, clinging to the weekly drama of the /r/CFB poll felt like a tiny act of defiance against the overwhelming uncertainty. A small, comforting bubble where we could still debate, still root, still feel *something* familiar.

Alabama, Notre Dame, Ohio State – they were at the top of the list that year. But honestly, I think we all just needed *a* list. We needed something to focus on, something to argue about, something to remind us that even in the midst of chaos, some things, at least, remained
