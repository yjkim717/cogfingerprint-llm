## The Swing, the Screen, and the Search for Improvement

So, 2020 has been…a year, right? For me, it’s also been a year of rediscovering my love for golf. I finally bit the bullet and got a professional club fitting – turns out my old clubs were *really* holding me back! My fitter suggested lessons, naturally. But then the question hit: range lessons versus something with video analysis?

Honestly, it felt overwhelming. Range time is familiar, comfortable. But the idea of seeing my swing dissected on a screen? A little intimidating! I’m leaning towards trying video analysis. It feels like a smarter investment, a chance to really *see* what I'm doing wrong. Hoping it'll be worth it – and maybe help me finally break 90! Anyone else diving deep into their game this year?
