Of course. Here is a reflective blog post about sports in 2020.

### The Game That Wasn't On

I’ll be honest, 2020 was the year I fell back in love with sports, and it had nothing to do with a championship win or a record-breaking play. It happened in the eerie silence of my own living room.

I remember the first major league game that came back after the world had pressed pause. I was so excited. I clicked on the TV, ready for the roar of the crowd, the crack of the bat, the energy that usually vibrates through the screen. Instead, what I got was… quiet. The hollow *thwump* of a ball hitting a glove. The distant, tinny chatter of players from the dugout. And cardboard cutouts staring blankly from the stands.

It was weird. For a few minutes, it felt wrong, like watching a play with no audience. But then something shifted. I started actually *seeing* the game. I noticed the subtle, unspoken communication between a pitcher and his catcher. I saw the raw, unfiltered emotion on a player’s face after a strikeout—no crowd to boo or cheer, just pure, personal frustration. Without the deafening spectacle, the sport was stripped down to its bare essentials: incredible athletes performing at the highest level, for the sheer love of the game and for us, the people watching from our isolated bubbles.

That’s when it hit me. We weren't just missing the noise; we were missing each other. The shared gasp, the collective groan, the high-five with a stranger in a sports bar—that was the true magic. The game on the field was just the catalyst.

In 2020, sports stopped being a distraction and became a connection. A fragile, digital thread tying millions of us together in a shared, hopeful experience. It reminded me that the heart of sports isn't the trophy; it's the community that forms around it. And I’ve never been more grateful for that community than in a year we had to be so far apart.
