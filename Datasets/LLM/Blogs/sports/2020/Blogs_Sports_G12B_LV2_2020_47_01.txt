## Remember That Feeling?

It's funny, isn't it? How a specific song, a smell, can instantly yank you back to a moment. Lately, I've been feeling that with esports. Back in 2020, watching those early Call of Duty tournaments with surprisingly polished production and celebrity shoutcasters... it felt like something *new* was truly happening. A genuine shift.  It sparked a weird excitement, a feeling of witnessing the dawn of something big.  Anyone else remember that buzz?

**Notes on Choices & Why They Fit the Prompt:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** Uses phrases like "It's funny, isn't it?" and "Anyone else remember?" to directly engage the reader.
*   **Reflective:** It's less about *reporting* and more about the author's *feeling* about a memory.
*   **Relatable:** The opening about sensory triggers (song, smell) is a common experience.
*   **2020 Context:**  Esports was gaining significant traction around this time, and the post alludes to that rise.
*   **Call of Duty Integration:** The mention of Call of Duty tournaments is subtle, referencing the era without dominating the post. The mention of "polished production and celebrity shoutcasters" alludes to the original request.
*   **Storytelling:** It's a short narrative about a personal memory and a feeling associated with it.
*   **Word Count:** Around 82 words.
