The year 2020 was supposed to be my comeback season. After a nagging knee injury sidelined me for most of 2019, I was finally cleared. My personal "credit score" in the sport felt rebuilt; my "utilization" of my body was efficient again, the strength and mobility I'd lost now restored. I had a solid "bank" of training miles saved up, ready to be spent on the race course.

Then, the world stopped. Races were canceled, tracks closed, and team training became a solo endeavor. My comeback card was pulled right from my hand. It was a brutal test.

But that's when the real rebuilding began. Without the pressure of competition, I fell back in love with the simple act of moving. I focused on form, on the quiet rhythm of my breath, on the pure joy of a body that could run. It wasn't the season I'd envisioned, but it was the one I needed. It taught me that the foundation you build when no one is watching is the one that makes you unbreakable when the starting gun finally fires again.
