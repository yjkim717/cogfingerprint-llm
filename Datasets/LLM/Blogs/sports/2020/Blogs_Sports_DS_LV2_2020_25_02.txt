The empty stadiums of 2020 were haunting. As an athlete, my performance had always been a conversation with the crowdâ€”their energy, my response. Playing in that profound silence felt like shouting into a void. But it forced a change. I started listening to the game itself: the squeak of sneakers, the rhythm of my own breath. I wasn't performing for anyone but the sport. In that quiet, I finally heard the pure reason I started playing in the first place.
