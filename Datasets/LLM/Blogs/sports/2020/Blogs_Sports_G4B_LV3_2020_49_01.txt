It’s funny how a single fight can stick with you, isn’t it? I was completely floored watching Shana Dobson dismantle Mariya Agapova back in 2020. It wasn’t just the win – it was the *upset*. Dobson absolutely dominated, shattering records and proving that sometimes, the underdog truly rises to the top.  

That fight really reminded me that sports aren’t always about predictable outcomes. It’s about grit, determination, and those incredible moments where everything shifts.  A genuine underdog story, and honestly, a beautiful thing to witness.
