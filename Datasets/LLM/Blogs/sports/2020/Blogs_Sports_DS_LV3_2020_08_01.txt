It’s 2020, and I’m thinking back to the 1994 Eagles—that 7–2 start, the NFC’s top seed, everything clicking. Then, the collapse. Game after game, the hope just drained away. Losing to the 2–13 Bengals felt like a gut punch. How does a team with so much promise just unravel? It’s a reminder that in sports—and life—nothing’s guaranteed. Momentum can vanish in an instant. Even the strongest foundations can crumble, leaving you wondering what might have been.
