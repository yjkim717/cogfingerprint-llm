That first run back in 2020 felt strange. The empty streets were my stadium. No high-fives, no finish-line cheers, just the rhythm of my own breath. It wasn't about pace or distance anymore; it was a quiet, personal promise to keep moving when the world had stopped. I learned then that the heart of sport isn't the crowdâ€”it's the simple, stubborn will to take one more step.
