**The Ghosts of Week 17: 2020 and the Weight of a Playoff Prediction**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Looking back at 2020 feels like peering into a slightly distorted mirror. So much happened – the pandemic, the constant uncertainty – and, of course, the NFL season. I spent a ridiculous amount of time agonizing over those final weeks, desperately trying to predict who would make the playoffs. 

I’m talking all-nighters fueled by lukewarm coffee and a borderline unhealthy obsession with team standings. I even built a spreadsheet – don’t judge! – charting every possible scenario.  My record this season was… well, let’s just say it wasn’t pretty. But come Wild Card weekend, I was determined to channel my inner Gus Bradley and deliver some accurate playoff predictions.

There’s something deeply compelling about trying to forecast the unpredictable, especially when it’s tied to something you love as much as football. It’s not just about picking winners and losers; it’s about feeling connected to the game, to the teams, to the hopes and anxieties of the fans. 

Looking back now, I realize it was less about predicting the future and more about processing the season. Those last few weeks were a chance to reflect on what went right, what went wrong, and what I’d learned. 

So, as we look ahead to future playoff weekends, I’d love to hear from you. What are *your* predictions for this year?  Don’t be shy – let’s talk football and share the excitement (and maybe a little bit of nervous anticipation!).
