**The Echoes in the Stadium Silence**

Remember 2020? It felt like the world held its breath. Even the roar of the crowd – the electricity of a packed stadium – was gone. I found myself obsessing over baseball, specifically the ghosts of past seasons, the way the sunlight hit the green of the outfield. It felt… unsettling, almost like a half-remembered dream. 

I started thinking about the strange allure of nostalgia, how we cling to moments, to teams, as if they represent something solid in a world that felt increasingly fluid. It’s a feeling not unlike the seed of a dark, satirical mystery, right? Like a forgotten cult, holding onto a faded ideal. 

There’s a weird echo in those empty stadiums, isn’t there? A yearning for a time when things felt… simpler, even if they weren’t. Maybe that’s why I was drawn to this idea of a neo-noir mystery set in Florida, centered around a group obsessed with a place that, in its own way, felt like a manufactured dream. It’s a reminder that even the brightest lights can cast long, unsettling shadows.
