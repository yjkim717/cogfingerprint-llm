>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your input, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and incorporating the keywords. I've aimed for around 369 words, keeping the 2020 context in mind.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Year the Big 12 Felt…Off. (And My Wildly Inaccurate Predictions)**

Remember 2020? The year the world collectively held its breath? It wasn't just the pandemic, folks. It was *everything*. And somehow, even college basketball – a reliable source of predictable chaos – felt…different. I’m talking about the 2020-21 Big 12 season. Looking back, it's a dizzying mix of weirdness, unexpected upsets, and a whole lot of uncertainty.

I, like many, was trying to find some normalcy amidst the madness. So, naturally, I put together a ridiculously optimistic (and now hilariously wrong) prediction piece for each Big 12 team. Baylor, the Bears, were supposed to be a lock for a deep tournament run. Kansas? Well, Kansas is always Kansas, right? You just *assume* they’ll be competitive. And Texas Tech? I had them pegged as a gritty defensive powerhouse, ready to make another Final Four push.

Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)

The truth is, the season was a rollercoaster. Baylor started strong, then… well, then everything changed with the scandal. It was a gut punch, not just for the program, but for everyone who loves the game and expects a certain level of integrity. Seeing a team so full of potential crumble like that was a stark reminder of how fragile things can be.

And then there was Oklahoma State. The postseason ban… that one still stings, even now. It added another layer of complexity, another unsettling ripple to a year already overflowing with them. It wasn't just about basketball; it was about fairness, about the impact on the players who had done nothing wrong.

Texas Tech did alright, but not quite the dominant force I envisioned. Kansas, predictably, was… Kansas. Sometimes brilliant, sometimes baffling. And Baylor, despite the initial promise, ended up facing an entirely different, incredibly difficult reality.

Looking back, my predictions were laughable. But that’s okay. Because what the 2020-21 Big 12 season *really* taught me wasn't about bracketology or tournament seeding. It was about resilience, about dealing with the unexpected, and about how even the most familiar things can be thrown into disarray in an instant. It was a season that mirrored the year itself: unpredictable, heartbreaking, and ultimately, a reminder that sometimes, the best you can do is just keep moving forward.

What are your memories of that season? Let me know in the comments!
