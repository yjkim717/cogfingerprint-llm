"Leveling Up Fitness: A New Game Mode for 2020". As we navigated the challenges of 2020, I realized that our fitness journeys could use a boost of gamification. Inspired by the nostalgic ProgressBar 95 and modern browsers like Microsoft Edge, I propose a new game mode: "ProgressBar Fit". Different versions could be "Edge Runner" for sprint intervals or "IE Explorer" for endurance challenges. By injecting a dose of friendly competition and fun, we can stay motivated to reach our goals. Let's level up our fitness routines and make 2020 a year of progress, not just progress bars.
