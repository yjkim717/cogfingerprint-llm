## The Quiet Resilience of Watching From the Stands (2020)

Remember 2020? The year everything felt…muted? For me, a huge part of that was the absence of live sports. I’m not a die-hard fanatic, but the energy of a crowd, the shared anticipation, it was always a reliable source of joy. Suddenly, it was gone. 

Instead, I found myself watching games on my own, a strange, solitary experience. It made me realize how much I relied on that collective feeling – the roar after a goal, the collective groan of disappointment. It wasn't just about the game itself, it was about *being* there, connected to something larger. 

This year taught me a lot about appreciating the small things, and honestly, I’m looking forward to the day I can feel that stadium buzz again, even if it’s just from the stands.
