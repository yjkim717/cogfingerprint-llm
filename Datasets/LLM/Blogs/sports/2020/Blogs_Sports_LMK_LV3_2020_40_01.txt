As I sat on the couch in 2020, scrolling through my browser history on Google Chrome, I couldn't help but chuckle at the autocorrect suggestions. Just like a wrong move on the soccer field, a single incorrect autocomplete entry can be frustrating. I recalled the 2020 Olympics being postponed and how it affected my fitness routine. Removing that wrong search suggestion was therapeutic, much like clearing my mind after a tough game.
