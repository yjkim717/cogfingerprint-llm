## Letting Go of the Underdog (and a Little Bit of 2020)

It’s weird, isn’t it? How you can become attached to things, even when they’re not your *thing*. This year, watching the Detroit Lions has felt a lot like that. They weren't exactly contenders, let’s be honest. Plenty of losses, frustrating moments... a true reflection of 2020, really. 

But there was something about their scrappiness, that underdog spirit, that kept me tuning in. I wasn't a die-hard fan, never bought the merch, but I found myself genuinely hoping they'd pull off an upset. Then, they announced they were rebuilding, a whole new direction. Suddenly, rooting felt… different. Like holding onto something that was destined to change.

It's tough to let go, even of a team you don't *love*.  It’s a lesson in acceptance, I guess, a small echo of the bigger shifts happening around us all this year. Maybe next season will bring a new favorite. Maybe not. But for now, I’m wishing them well on their journey, and appreciating the little bit of hope they provided amidst the chaos.
