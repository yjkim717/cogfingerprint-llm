It’s 2020, and the world feels like it’s on pause, but on my island in *Animal Crossing*, life goes on. I’ll never forget Gloria, the snooty duck villager who surprised me. Sure, she had that haughty charm, always commenting on my outfits, but underneath was a fiercely kind spirit who lifted our little community.

Now, she’s decided to move on. It’s bittersweet, like a star athlete retiring—you celebrate their impact but feel the void they leave. In a year of isolation, these pixelated friendships meant everything. So, if you have room in your village, she’s available for free. Take good care of her; she’s one of a kind.
