**The Ghosts of Empty Stadiums**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020. We were all supposed to be roaring in stadiums, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, fueled by overpriced beer and the primal urge to yell at the TV. Instead, we had ghosts. The ghosts of empty seats, echoing with the silence of a pandemic. 

I remember watching the Lakers, trying to find the same electricity as before. LeBron was still incredible, but it just…felt wrong.  The energy was muted.  Even the wins felt a little hollow.  

Baseball was a slow, hesitant crawl. Football, a distant, unsettling promise.  It wasn't just about the games; it was about *being* with the fans.  There’s a strange melancholy to those memories, a reminder of what we lost, and a quiet hope for what might return.  It’s a year I won’t forget – a year where sports felt like a fragile, beautiful ghost.

But this wasn’t just a prank. This was… darker.
