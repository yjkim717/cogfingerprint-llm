## The Trophy Room Feels a Little…Empty

It's been a weird year, hasn’t it? So much time spent indoors, a lot of it surprisingly dedicated to Sporcle. I know, I know, not exactly peak athleticism. But those “minefield” quizzes? Seriously addictive. I chased those badges like they were championship rings. But lately, I've been thinking… does racking up completions *really* feel like an accomplishment? 

It’s like, shouldn't that first perfect run feel *extra* special? Maybe Sporcle (and honestly, any game really) would be more rewarding if badges were only awarded for that initial victory. It'd add a layer of challenge, a real sense of conquering something unique. Just a thought, as I stare at my digital trophy room, feeling… slightly underwhelmed.
