The year 2020 took away our stadiums, our cheers, and the simple comfort of a shared high-five. For months, my running shoes sat by the door, gathering dust alongside my motivation. The world had pressed pause, and my personal fitness goals felt trivial, forgotten.

Then, one overcast Tuesday, I laced them up again. Not for a race or a personal best, but just to move. That first mile was brutalâ€”a symphony of heavy breaths and protesting muscles. But with each step, something shifted. It wasn't about the finish line anymore; it was about the rhythm, the steady beat of my feet on the pavement providing a much-needed anchor in a chaotic time. I remembered that sometimes, the most significant victories are the quiet ones, the simple act of starting again.
