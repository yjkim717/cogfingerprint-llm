The year 2020 was supposed to be my season. All those pre-dawn training sessions, the empty stadiums where I pushed my limitsâ€”it was all building toward something. Then, the world stopped.

Suddenly, my track was my living room. The roar of a crowd became the quiet hum of uncertainty. At first, it felt like a loss, like all that sweat had evaporated into thin air.

But in that stillness, I found a different kind of strength. I wasn't running for a time or a medal anymore; I was running for the simple, profound joy of movement. The finish line disappeared, and in its place, I found my love for the sport all over again. Sometimes, the biggest wins happen when the race is called off.
