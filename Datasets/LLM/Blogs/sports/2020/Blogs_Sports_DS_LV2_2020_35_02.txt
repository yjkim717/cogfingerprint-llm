There’s a photo from a frigid February 2020 run that still makes me smile. My face is a mask of frost, eyelashes frozen, but my eyes are alight. That sub-zero windchill bit right through my layers, but I was chasing a feeling, not just a time. In a year the world seemed to stop, running was my moving meditation. That route, captured in that single race photo, was my sanctuary. It reminds me that sometimes the hardest conditions forge the most vivid memories. It wasn't about the pace, but the perseverance—a small, personal victory in a year that demanded so much of it from all of us.
