## The Week College Football Felt… Surreal (and a Quick Look at That r/CFB Poll)

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn't it? It’s a year that redefined “unprecedented” for just about everyone, and college football was certainly no exception. We were navigating a pandemic, seeing conferences scramble to adjust schedules, and witnessing teams rise and fall with a dizzying speed. It felt, at times, like anything could happen.

I remember checking the r/CFB poll on December 8th, 2020, and feeling that familiar mix of anticipation and mild anxiety. It was a snapshot of a season that felt both incredibly long and strangely compressed. Alabama was sitting pretty at number one, a familiar sight, but Notre Dame was breathing down their necks. That rivalry, that constant tension – it felt like a perfect representation of the entire season. 

What struck me most wasn't necessarily *who* was ranked where, but the sheer volatility. Teams that looked dominant one week would stumble the next, and the rankings would shift accordingly. Ohio State, for instance, had a particularly interesting journey. It highlighted how quickly things could change in a sport already full of unpredictable moments.

Looking back, the 2020 college football season wasn't just about wins and losses. It was about resilience, adaptation, and a collective desire to experience something normal amidst a world of chaos. That r/CFB poll, and the discussions around it, were a small part of that shared experience. It was a place to debate, to commiserate, and to simply connect with others who understood the passion and the heartbreak of college football. And honestly, in a year like 2020, those connections felt more valuable than ever.



Do you remember where *your* team landed that week?
