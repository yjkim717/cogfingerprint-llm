The year 2020 took our ball away. Stadiums fell silent, the squeak of sneakers on court just a memory. My weekly pickup game, that sacred space of sweat and laughter, vanished.

At first, it was a void. I missed the rhythm, the unspoken communication, the pure, physical joy of a perfect pass. But in that quiet, I found a different kind of sport. My son and I started kicking a soccer ball in the backyard. No score, no rules, just the thud of the ball and our shared laughter.

I realized then, sports was never about the arena. It was always about the connection. 2020 didn't take the game; it just brought it back home.
