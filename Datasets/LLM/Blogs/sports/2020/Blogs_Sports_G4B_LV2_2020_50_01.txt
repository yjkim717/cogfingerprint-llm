**The Echo in the Gym**

Remember 2020? That feeling of *everything* being paused, yet still buzzing with activity? I was obsessed with online workouts, desperately trying to maintain some semblance of routine. I’d share my training schedule with everyone – my family, friends, even random contacts – hoping for encouragement. 

It quickly devolved into a loop. “Hey, are you still working out?” “Yeah, just repeating the same routine!” It felt… exhausting. Like a voicemail stuck on repeat.  I realized I needed to slow down, to just *be* with my workouts, not constantly broadcasting them. Sometimes, a little quiet focus is way more effective than a million requests.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps create a post based on a different summary?
