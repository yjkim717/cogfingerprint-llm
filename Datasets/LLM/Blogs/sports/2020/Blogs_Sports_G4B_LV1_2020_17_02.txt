**Hitting a Wall (and Maybe a Lesson?)**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020 was all about trying to *do* something – new routines, new hobbies, new gear. I’d been obsessing over a shiny new driver, convinced it was the key to finally cracking my golf game. I was spending my savings, researching reviews, practically drooling over the potential for a sweet drive. 

Then, last week, a chat with a guy at the golf shop completely shifted my perspective. He gently suggested I might be focusing on the wrong thing. “Seriously,” he said, “instruction first. The right swing is worth more than any club.” 

It’s humbling, to admit you’ve been chasing the wrong target. Now I'm seriously considering some golf lessons – maybe it’s time to build a solid foundation instead of just hoping for a miracle club.

Do you want me to tweak this draft in any way (e.g., change the tone, add a specific detail, or adjust the length)?
