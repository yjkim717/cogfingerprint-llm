"The Frustrating Fumble: When Pre-Approval Meets Persistence"

As I geared up to drive off into the sunset in my new Subaru, I thought I had done my due diligence. Pre-approved for a car loan through Bank of America in 2020, I was confident that the financing part of the process would be a slam dunk. But, to my surprise, local dealerships had other plans. Despite my pre-approval letter, they insisted on running their own credit checks, leaving me feeling like a quarterback facing a blitz. It was frustrating to say the least. I had done my research, and my credit score was in check. Why the redundancy? It was a minor setback, but it made me realize that sometimes, even with preparation, things don't always go as planned. The key is to stay calm, persistent, and keep moving forward â€“ just like in sports, where adaptability is key to success.
