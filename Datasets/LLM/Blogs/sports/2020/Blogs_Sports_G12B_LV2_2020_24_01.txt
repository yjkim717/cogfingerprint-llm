## The Unexpected Victory Lap

Remember that feeling of finally nailing a tough skill? Like sinking that free throw after countless misses? I had a moment like that last week, watching my niece learn to ride her bike. She’d been frustrated, wobbly, ready to quit. Then, *bam*, she was pedaling, beaming! 

It reminded me of chasing goals, any goal. Sometimes, the real victory isn't just reaching the finish line, but the perseverance along the way. 2020’s been a year of unexpected detours, hasn't it? But maybe those wobbles are just preparing us for our own unexpected victory laps.
