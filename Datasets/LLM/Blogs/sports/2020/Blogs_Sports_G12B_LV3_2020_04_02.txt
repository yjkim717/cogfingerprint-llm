## The Curious Case of Simmons & SVP

It’s been a weird few years, hasn't it? Staring down 2020, I've been thinking a lot about unexpected silences. Like, why haven't Bill Simmons and SVP ever really crossed paths on podcasts? They both clearly dig sports gambling, share a connection through Russillo… you’d think a conversation would be gold. A Reddit thread got me pondering – what happened? It's a small thing, but these little sports media mysteries always stick with you.
