Looking back from 2020, the 1994 Eagles still sting. That 7-2 start had us dreaming of a Super Bowl. They were the NFC's top seed, a powerhouse. Then, the inexplicable happened. Not a rash of injuries, just a slow, painful unraveling. They lost every single game down the stretch. It’s a haunting reminder that in sports, momentum is everything. A team can look unbeatable one month and utterly lost the next. It’s the kind of collapse that makes you appreciate just how fragile a winning season truly is.
