**The Quiet Strength of Backup Players**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020. Everything felt…off. My local cricket team was a mess, injuries piling up and morale dragging. I was stuck on the bench most of the season, a backup player, really. Honestly, I wasn’t thrilled. I wanted to *play*. 

But then I started watching Leo, our number 11. He wasn’t flashy, just quietly reliable. He’d always be ready, offering a steady hand and a calm presence. He’d built a real sense of community within the team, even when he wasn't in the eleven. 

It made me realize that sometimes, the most valuable contribution isn’t about being the star. It’s about being the solid foundation, the villager who quietly supports the team, just like Gloria on my island – a vital part, even if you don’t always notice it.
