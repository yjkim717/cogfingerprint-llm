## Remember When You Thought You Had It All Figured Out? (A Letter to My 2018 Self About Running)

It's 2020, and the world feels… complicated, to say the least. But amidst all the chaos, I’ve been thinking a lot about simpler times. Specifically, about my running. Back in 2018, I was *convinced* I was crushing it. I was hitting all my mileage goals, posting those perfectly filtered Instagram photos of sunrise runs, and genuinely believing I was on the path to a personal best. 

I remember feeling smug, almost. Like I had unlocked some secret to consistent fitness. 

Then, 2019 happened. A nagging knee injury, a sudden shift in work demands, and just…life. My perfectly planned training schedule crumbled. I missed runs. I felt guilty. I questioned everything. The smugness evaporated, replaced by frustration and a surprising dose of self-doubt.

Looking back now, I wish I could send a message to my 2018 self. Not to brag about future races (because, let’s be honest, things didn’t go *exactly* to plan), but to offer a bit of reassurance. It’s okay to miss runs. It’s okay when your body rebels. It’s okay when your goals shift. 

The joy of running isn’t in the rigid adherence to a plan, it’s in the simple act of putting one foot in front of the other, even when it's hard. And sometimes, it *is* hard. Really hard. But that’s part of the journey. Give yourself grace. Remember why you started. And don't beat yourself up when things don't go as expected. Trust me, 2020 has taught me that much.
