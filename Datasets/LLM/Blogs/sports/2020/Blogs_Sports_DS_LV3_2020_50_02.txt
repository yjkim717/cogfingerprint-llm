It’s 2020, and my team’s season just vanished overnight. No final buzzer, no last huddle—just silence. I find myself scrolling through old YouTube Music playlists, trying to sort my library alphabetically by artist, clinging to the familiar rhythm of pre-game tracks. Each name—from A to Z—brings back a specific memory: that victory anthem, the tough loss tune. In a year without sports, my music library has become my new roster, each artist a teammate I can still count on to bring back the feeling of the game.
