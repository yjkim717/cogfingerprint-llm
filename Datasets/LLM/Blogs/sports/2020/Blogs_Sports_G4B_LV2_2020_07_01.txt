**The Weight of the Loss**

Remember 2020? It felt like a year of constant disappointment, didn’t it? I was glued to the baseball playoffs, rooting for the Yankees, and it just… fell apart.  Watching them lose to the Tampa Bay Rays, it wasn’t just about a game. It was this heavy feeling – a weird mix of frustration and sadness. 

It reminded me of how sport, at its best, can hold up a mirror to our own vulnerabilities.  That crushing defeat felt like a personal setback, a reminder that even when you’re striving for something, sometimes things don't go your way. It made me think about resilience, about picking yourself up and trying again, even when the scoreboard says otherwise.  Anyone else feel that pang of loss this year?

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
