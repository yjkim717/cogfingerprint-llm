As I sat on the couch in the spring of 2020, flipping through sports highlights, I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment. The COVID-19 pandemic had brought the world of sports to a grinding halt, with leagues and tournaments being cancelled left and right. I remembered the thrill of watching my favorite teams battle it out on the field, the roar of the crowd, and the rush of adrenaline as the players gave it their all. But now, the stadiums were empty, and the silence was deafening. As I watched old game footage, I was transported back to a time when sports were a normal part of life. It was a bittersweet nostalgia, reminding me of the joy that sports bring, and the void that their absence had left. I couldn't help but wonder when we'd be back to cheering on our teams together.
