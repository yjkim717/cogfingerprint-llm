"Slam Dunk or Fumble? Charitable Giving in the CARES Act"

As I watched the March Madness tournament get cancelled in 2020, I couldn't help but think about the bigger picture. The COVID-19 pandemic had brought the world to a standstill, and the sports industry was not immune. But amidst the chaos, the CARES Act brought a glimmer of hope for non-profits and charitable organizations. 

The CARES Act introduced a significant change to charitable giving incentives - allowing individuals to deduct up to $300 in charitable donations without itemizing their tax returns. Sounds like a slam dunk for non-profits, right? However, the Joint Committee on Taxation's interpretation of the provision has raised some eyebrows. It appears that the $300 deduction is per tax-filing unit, not per individual. This means that a married couple filing jointly can only claim a single $300 deduction, whereas two single individuals filing separately can each claim the deduction, totaling $600. 

This interpretation has significant implications for higher education fundraising, where alumni often give jointly with their spouses. Does this mean that a university can only count a joint donation as a single $300 deduction? It's a question that has left many in the non-profit sector scratching their heads. As the sports world knows, a fumble can be a game-changer. In this case, the interpretation of the CARES Act may be a fumble for charitable giving. I hope that further clarification will be provided soon, so non-profits can continue to score big in the world of philanthropy.
