**The Moment My Confidence Short-Circuited**

It’s funny how a single, seemingly small mistake can really shake you up, right? Back in 2020, I was really diving into my local running club – determined to finally shave some serious time off my 5k. I’d been following all the training plans, meticulously tracking my pace, and generally feeling pretty good about my progress. 

Then came the race. I was feeling strong, hitting my stride, when I made a rookie error. In my eagerness to keep things tidy in my race belt, I started wrapping my headphones cable around the post on my shoe – a habit I’d picked up from messing around with my stereo system at home. 

Suddenly, the connection was patchy, the music cut out, and I felt this weird, unsettling disconnect. It felt like a short circuit. I slowed down, frustrated and worried, and then – *pop* – the fuse blew in my running watch. It was a tiny, embarrassing moment, but it felt huge. 

It reminded me that sometimes, overthinking and trying to control *everything* can actually throw you off course. It’s okay to let go a little, and trust the process.
