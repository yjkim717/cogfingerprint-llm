"As I watched the 2020 NFL season unfold, I was struck by the resilience of athletes recovering from injury. Like the dog owner seeking help for their post-op pup, many players face daunting recoveries. One wrong step can set them back. But with support and patience, they can regain their strength. It's a powerful reminder that healing takes time, and sometimes, all it takes is a helping hand to get back in the game."
