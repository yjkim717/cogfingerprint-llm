"Dusting off my old skateboard in 2020 was a game-changer. After years of being stored away, I rediscovered my passion for skateboarding. It's like The DÃ¸'s indie vibes - it's all about revisiting what's been left behind. I'm now seeking new tricks, just like I'm on the hunt for new tunes to get sick to."
