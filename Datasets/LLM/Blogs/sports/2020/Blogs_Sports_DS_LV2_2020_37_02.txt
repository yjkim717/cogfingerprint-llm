It’s 2020, and here I am again, staring at the Rangers’ roster like a puzzle with too many of the same pieces. We’ve got right-handed defensemen stacked up like firewood, but that crucial left-handed top-four spot? It’s still a gap that keeps me up at night.

I remember watching games and feeling that defensive imbalance—it’s like having a glove that doesn’t quite fit. But there’s hope in our prospect pool, brimming with talent just waiting for a shot. Maybe it’s time to make a move, trade from our depth to shore up what’s missing. After all, building a contender isn’t just about collecting players; it’s about finding the right ones to complete the picture. Let’s make it happen, Blueshirts.
