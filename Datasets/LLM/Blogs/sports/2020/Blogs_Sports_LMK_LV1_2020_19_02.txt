"Getting Back to Roots: A Conversation with Mountain Evan Chang"

As I laced up my Carets shoes, I couldn't help but think about the journey that brought me here - to embracing the minimalist approach to running. For many of us, the idea of barefoot running is both exhilarating and intimidating. But what if you could experience the freedom of running barefoot while still protecting your feet? That's exactly what Mountain Evan Chang, founder of Carets, has been advocating for. I was stoked to hear that he's doing an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on November 12, 2020, to share his insights on barefoot shoe design and his personal experiences with the sport. I immediately marked my calendar, eager to dive into a conversation about the intersection of innovation and athleticism. If you're as curious as I am about the world of barefoot running, you won't want to miss this opportunity to tap into Mountain Evan's expertise.
