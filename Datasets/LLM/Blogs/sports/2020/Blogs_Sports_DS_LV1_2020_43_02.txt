Looking back at 2020, when the world seemed to pause, I found myself reflecting on my high school PE classes. We learned to climb ropes and play dodgeball, but never how to set a boundary with our bodies. I remember watching women’s sports finally get more airtime and thinking about the strength on display—not just athletic, but a deep, resilient power.

What if we channeled that? Instead of just games, what if PE taught empowerment? Simple self-defense moves could be as fundamental as a layup. It’s not about living in fear, but about building an unshakable confidence from the ground up. That’s a lesson worth carrying long after the final whistle.
