**The Unexpected Grit of a Zoom Season**

2020… wow. It felt like the world collectively took a deep breath and held it for a really long time. As a local soccer coach, I was staring at a screen more than a field, guiding my U12 team through Zoom practices. It was…weird. 

Honestly, the first few weeks were rough. We missed the camaraderie, the shared sweat, the instinctive adjustments on the pitch. But something shifted. We started celebrating small wins – a perfect pass, a clever dribble – as loudly as if we were shouting from the sidelines. 

We learned to build connection in a new way. It forced us to be more intentional with encouragement, to really *see* each player’s effort.  It wasn't the season we’d planned, but it taught me a surprising lesson about grit, resilience, and the power of finding joy in the unexpected.
