Looking back on that strange summer of 2020, when real sports went quiet, my competitive spirit found a home in Sporcle quizzes. I’d retry the same minefield over and over, chasing that "June Kaboom" badge. But it felt hollow. True achievement, in sports or trivia, shouldn't be about grinding repeats. It's about that one unique, perfect play when everything clicks. That’s the win that really counts.
