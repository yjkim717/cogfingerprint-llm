"The year 2020 will be remembered for many shocking moments in the UFC, but none as jarring as Shana Dobson's knockout victory over Mariya Agapova. As the underdog, Dobson was expected to fall to the more experienced Agapova. Instead, she pulled off the unthinkable, securing a win that will go down in history as one of the biggest upsets in MMA. Dobson's triumph serves as a reminder that in the Octagon, anything can happen, and that even the most unlikely fighters can rise to the top and make their mark."
