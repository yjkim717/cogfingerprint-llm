That first lockdown run in March 2020 was my personal stock market crash. My lungs burned, my legs felt like lead. Every headline screamed canceled seasons and empty stadiums. But I kept lacing up, day after day. It wasn't about winning a race; it was about finishing the mile. In a world where everything felt like it was on pause, the simple, grueling act of moving forward became my most valuable investment. The finish line wasn't a place, it was a state of mind.
