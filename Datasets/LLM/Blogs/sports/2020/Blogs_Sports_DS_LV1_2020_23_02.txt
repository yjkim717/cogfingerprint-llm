It’s 2020, and I’ve been thinking a lot about what makes a true champion. Watching Survivor’s “Winners at War” season, I’m struck by the mix of old school legends and new school strategists—all genuine fans of the game, not just people chasing clout. It reminds me of my high school basketball days.

We had veterans who played with heart and instinct, and rookies who brought fresh tactics and analytics. But the ones who truly shined weren’t there for the highlight reels—they lived and breathed the sport. That’s what Survivor gets right: casting real fans creates magic, whether on the island or the court. In a year full of uncertainty, there’s something comforting about seeing passion triumph over pretense. It’s a lesson that sticks, long after the final buzzer.
