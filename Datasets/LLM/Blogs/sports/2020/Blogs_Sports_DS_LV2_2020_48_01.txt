The final buzzer echoed in the empty 2020 arena. My stat line? Two assists, zero goals. On paper, it looked quiet. But my teammate’s winning shot? That started with my pass in the chaos. We’re so fixated on the scoreboard, the big numbers. But what about the play that doesn't get a stat? The screen I set, the space I created. True performance isn't always in the points. It's in the quiet work that makes the win possible.
