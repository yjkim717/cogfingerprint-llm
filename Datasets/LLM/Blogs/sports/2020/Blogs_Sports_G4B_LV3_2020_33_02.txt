**The Unsung Hero of My Lockdown Team**

2020… honestly, it felt like a year of unexpected shifts. I was part of a local online volleyball team, and we were all struggling to find our rhythm with everything going on. There was this one player, Maya, who hadn’t been super vocal – almost seemed a little distant at first. We’d nicknamed her “Gloria” after the Animal Crossing villager – a bit quiet, but incredibly reliable. 

Honestly, I’d written her off a little, expecting minimal contribution. But as the season progressed, she started consistently making the plays we needed. Her defense was solid, her serves were surprisingly powerful, and she always seemed to know where to be. 

It made me realize that sometimes, the people who don’t immediately jump into the spotlight are the ones who quietly build a team up. It’s a reminder that true value isn’t always about boasting – sometimes, it’s about just *being* a strong, dependable part of the island community.
