The 2020-21 college basketball season is shaping up to be an exciting one, especially with the Big 12 conference. As we dive into the preseason, fans are buzzing with anticipation, trying to gauge which teams will come out on top. As a longtime fan, I love analyzing the rosters, coaching staff, and overall team dynamics to make some educated predictions.

Let's start with the defending champs, the Kansas Jayhawks. They return a ton of talent, including their star duo, Ochai Agbaji and Christian Braun. With a relatively healthy roster, I expect them to be a force to be reckoned with once again. However, they're not the only ones to watch. The Baylor Bears, led by coach Scott Drew, have been quietly building a formidable team. With a strong defense and a balanced offense, they're poised to make a deep run in the conference tournament.

The West Virginia Mountaineers are another team that's caught my eye. With a revamped roster and the addition of some key transfers, they're looking to turn their season around after a disappointing 2019-20 campaign. Their high-intensity defense and athleticism will make them a tough matchup for any team in the Big 12.

Of course, there are always dark horses to consider. The Texas Tech Red Raiders, with their suffocating defense, could be the team to watch if they can stay healthy. And let's not count out the Iowa State Cyclones, who have a strong nucleus returning and a new addition in Osun Osunniyi, a talented big man.

As we look ahead to the regular season, I'm predicting a tight race at the top of the Big 12 standings. Kansas, Baylor, and West Virginia will be battling it out, with Texas and Texas Tech not far behind. And when the conference tournament rolls around, I expect a thrilling showdown in the championship game. My money is on Kansas to take it, but Baylor will be right there, pushing them to the limit.

One thing's for sure: the 2020-21 Big 12 college basketball season is going to be an exciting ride. With so many talented teams and players on the court, it's shaping up to be a thrilling year for fans. So grab your popcorn, get cozy, and let's enjoy the ride! As the season tips off, I'm eager to see how these teams will perform and which Cinderella stories will emerge. One thing's certain â€“ it'll be a wild ride.
