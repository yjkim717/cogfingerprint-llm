**The Rhythm of a Recovery**

2020 felt like a constant, slightly off-beat track.  Like a kick drum that just wouldn’t quite hit right – a little muddy, lacking that sharp, driving pulse.  I was a runner, and after a pretty brutal injury, getting back into it felt exactly like that.  Each step was a struggle to find the right frequency, the right balance. 

I started obsessing over the sound of my own feet hitting the pavement, trying to pinpoint where the “punch” was missing. It reminded me of that music producer’s quest for the perfect kick drum – a clean, powerful core.  Slowly, through patience and careful adjustments to my form, I rebuilt that rhythm.  It wasn't instant, but finding that solid beat again, that clear pulse, was a huge relief.
