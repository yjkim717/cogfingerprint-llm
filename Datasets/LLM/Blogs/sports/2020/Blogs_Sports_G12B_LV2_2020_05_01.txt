>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for that engaging, reflective, and relatable tone, and incorporating the 2020 context.  I've woven in a subtle nod to the initial prompt's theme of data/averages without making it overtly technical.

## Finding My Pace in a Pandemic Year

2020.  Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn’t it?  Everything felt… suspended. But amidst the uncertainty, I found solace in something simple: walking.  Suddenly, my daily commute disappeared, but the need to move *didn't*. I started tracking my steps, just as a way to mark the days, to see some kind of progress.  It wasn't about hitting a crazy goal, more about finding a rhythm, a steady pace in a world that felt completely out of sync.  Some months were better than others, naturally. But looking back, it’s comforting to see those consistent efforts, a quiet testament to keeping going. It’s a small thing, but it mattered.

**Why I think this works for your request:**

*   **Relatable Context:** Grounded in the shared experience of 2020 and the pandemic.
*   **Conversational Tone:** Uses phrases like "doesn't it?", "just as a way," "more about."
*   **Reflective:** Explores the *why* behind the activity – finding solace and rhythm.
*   **Storytelling:**  Presents a personal narrative rather than just stating facts.
*   **Subtle Connection to Prompt:** The idea of tracking and finding averages (months being "better or worse") is present without being overtly about code.
