As a Sage main in 2020’s Valorant, I often felt like my combat score was lying. Sure, my kill count wasn’t flashy, but what about the clutch heals that turned rounds? The risky revives that brought our duelist back to life? The precious seconds I stalled with my wall, letting our team rotate? The scoreboard never captured those quiet, game-changing moments. It makes you wonder if the system truly values the subtle art of support, or just the loud glory of the frag.
