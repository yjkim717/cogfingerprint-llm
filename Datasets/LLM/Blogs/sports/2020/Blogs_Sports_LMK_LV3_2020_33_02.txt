I'm trading in my golf clubs for a new kind of game - literally. Just like I'm letting go of Gloria, the snooty yet kind-hearted villager on my Animal Crossing island, I'm passing on my competitive golf spirit to the gaming community. As we navigated the challenges of 2020, I found solace in the relaxing world of Island Life. But, as I reflect on my golfing days, I realize that the camaraderie and sportsmanship I experienced on the course are similar to the connections I've made with fellow gamers online. Both have taught me the value of community, patience, and good sportsmanship. Who knew that trading in my golf clubs for a controller would lead to a new kind of friendly competition?
