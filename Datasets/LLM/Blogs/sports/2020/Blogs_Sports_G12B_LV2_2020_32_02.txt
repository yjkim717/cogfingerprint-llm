Okay, here's a reflective blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational, relatable, and slightly nostalgic tone fitting for a 2020 context. I've focused on the feeling of change and the potential loss of tradition in college football.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Echo of Saturday Afternoon: What Happens When Tradition Shifts?**

Remember that feeling? The crisp autumn air, the smell of grilling burgers, the roar of the crowd – Saturday afternoon college football. It was a ritual, a constant in a world that felt increasingly chaotic, especially in 2020. We were all craving a little normalcy, a little bit of familiar comfort.

And a big part of that comfort was the unexpected. The little upsets, the surprising non-conference matchups that popped up and gave us something to talk about.  I'm thinking of [insert a specific, memorable non-conference game you recall, e.g., "that Appalachian State game against Michigan back in '07"]. Those games, often against teams from outside the usual power conferences, felt like a breath of fresh air.

But lately, I’ve been thinking about how much is changing. The ACC's new scheduling rules, limiting non-conference games to in-state opponents, feels like another shift. It’s designed to help with scheduling and maybe boost some G5 programs, which is understandable. But there's a pang of sadness, too. 

Will we lose that magic of the unknown? That feeling of a small school program getting a shot on the big stage? Will the Saturdays feel just a little less… special? I don't know. Maybe this is just the evolution of the game. But for now, I’ll hold onto those memories of unexpected Saturdays, and hope we don't lose sight of the traditions that made college football so beloved.

**Notes & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Replace the bracketed example:** Insert a specific non-conference game that resonates with your (or your target audience's) memories. This will make the post much more personal and engaging.
*   **Consider adding a personal anecdote:** A brief story about a specific experience you had attending or watching a non-conference game could enhance the reflective feel.
*   **Tone:** I've aimed for a slightly melancholic but hopeful tone. You can adjust this based on your desired style.
*   **2020 Context:** The mention of "especially in 2020" is meant to subtly ground the post in that time frame, acknowledging the broader anxieties and shifts happening in the world.
