### More Than Just Miles: What My Running Shoes Taught Me About Community in 2020

I remember buying this pair of running shoes in late 2019. They were bright, optimistic things, the color of a sunrise. I had grand plans for them: a spring marathon, maybe a trail race. Then, 2020 happened, and the world shrank to the size of my neighborhood block. Those sunrise-colored shoes became my escape pod.

Around April, feeling the walls close in, I stumbled into the running subreddit. It was a digital campfire for people like me, all trying to outrun the same anxieties. I’d lurk in the weekly threads. “Weekly Training Check-in” was my favorite. It was just a simple post, but seeing hundreds of people share their humble three-milers, their failed speed workouts, or their joy at just getting out the door… it was a mirror. It told me I wasn’t running alone, even when the streets were empty.

The community hit a huge milestone this year—one million members. A million! In a year of isolation, a million people found connection here. The mods marked the occasion by asking us to help refresh the place. Some of the weekly threads were getting a little quiet, they said. What new threads did we want? What would keep this community feeling like, well, a community?

The response was incredible. Suggestions flooded in: a weekly “Noob Question” safe space, a “Race Report” thread for our solo virtual races, a “Running Shoe Spotlight” for gearheads like me. It hit me then—this wasn’t just about organizing a forum. It was an act of collective care. We were all taking ownership, building the very support system we needed.

My sunrise-colored shoes are scuffed and muddy now, the tread worn down from a year’s worth of solace. They carried me through the miles, but it was that digital community that carried me through the year. It taught me that a personal sport like running is never truly personal. Our strides are solitary, but the encouragement, the shared struggles, and the simple act of showing up for each other in a weekly thread—that’s what creates the rhythm we all run to. Here’s to the next mile, together.
