The year 2020 forced us all to slow down, and for me, that meant coaching my son’s little league team from our backyard instead of a real diamond. We used a worn-out tennis ball and a makeshift home plate drawn in chalk. At first, I worried he was missing out on the real game—the crack of the bat, the roar of the crowd. But in that quiet space, something shifted. We weren't just practicing swings; we were talking about focus, resilience, and the simple joy of play. Sometimes, the most profound victories aren't found on a scoreboard, but in the unexpected moments of connection.
