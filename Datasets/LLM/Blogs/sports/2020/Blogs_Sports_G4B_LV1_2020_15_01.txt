**Lost in the Echoes: Finding My Next Favorite Band**

Okay, so I’ve been completely obsessed with The Dø lately – specifically, that hazy, atmospheric track “Circles.” It’s stuck in my head, and I’m desperately searching for music with a similar vibe.  Anyone else find themselves chasing that feeling after discovering a new band?  I’m looking for something with a cinematic quality, maybe leaning into indie rock or even a movie soundtrack feel. Hit me with your suggestions!

**The Quiet of Empty Stadiums**

It's weird, isn't it? 2020. I remember the roar of the crowd at the baseball games, the electric energy of the college football season. This year, though, it was just… quiet.  I’d sit on my porch, watching the sun set, imagining the players out there, the cheers, the competition.  It felt like a piece of my soul was missing.  There was a strange beauty in the stillness, a reminder of what we truly value.
