The year 2020 forced us all to slow down, even in sports. I remember trying to coach my nephew’s little league team over video calls—a far cry from the dusty field. One evening, leaving a voicemail for a parent, I rattled off my number too fast. I had to repeat the whole thing, feeling that familiar rush of frustration. It was a small moment, but it hit me: we’re so conditioned to hurry, even our words trip over themselves. Slowing down, whether in sharing a phone number or in life, isn’t a delay. It’s a chance to be clear, to connect more deeply, even from a distance. Sometimes, the most valuable play is the pause.
