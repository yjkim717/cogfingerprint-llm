The year 2020 took away so muchâ€”the roar of the stadium, the high-fives from teammates, the simple joy of a shared locker room. My sport was put on indefinite hold, and I felt a part of my identity fading. The initial weeks were a fog of frustration, my cleats gathering dust by the door.

But then, I started running. Just me and the empty pavement at dawn. It was in that solitary rhythm that I found a different kind of strength. It wasn't about competition anymore; it was about resilience. I learned that the heart of an athlete isn't defined by the game, but by the courage to adapt when the game is taken away. I was still an athlete, just on a new, quieter field.
