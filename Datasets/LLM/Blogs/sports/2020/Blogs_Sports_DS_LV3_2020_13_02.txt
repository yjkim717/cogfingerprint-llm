It was early 2020, and the email notification felt like a buzzer-beater. A fan in Canada wanted a vintage jersey of our university’s legendary ’90s basketball duo. My heart soared—until I saw the logistics.

Ecommerce sounded so simple until international shipping, sales tax, and Canadian customs duties entered the game. I wasn’t a corporation; I was just a former team manager turned shop owner, trying to keep the spirit of those players alive. The rules felt like a full-court press.

But then I remembered those players—how they navigated double-teams and tight defenses with patience and precision. This was my fourth quarter. I took a deep breath, researched the forms, and decided to handle the fees myself. It wasn’t about the sale; it was about connecting a fan with a piece of history, even from afar. Sometimes, the assist means more than the shot.
