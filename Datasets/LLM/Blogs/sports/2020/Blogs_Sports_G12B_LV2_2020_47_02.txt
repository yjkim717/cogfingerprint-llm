## The Echo of Empty Stadiums

Remember the spring? Suddenly, the roar was gone. No packed stadiums, no Friday night lights. Just… silence. It felt surreal, watching baseball games with piped-in crowd noise – a bizarre imitation of the real thing. It made me realize how much of the experience *isn't* just the game itself, but the collective energy, the shared passion. 2020 took that away, and it was a lesson in appreciating the simple joys we often overlook.




Hope this fits what you were looking for!
