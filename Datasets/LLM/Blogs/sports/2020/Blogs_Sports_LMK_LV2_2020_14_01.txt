The 2020-21 Big 12 college basketball season - a wild ride we were all excited to embark on, until the world had other plans. As we navigated the uncharted waters of a pandemic-ravaged sports landscape, March Madness took on a whole new meaning. But before the chaos ensued, we had our preseason polls and predictions to get us hyped.

Let's be real, who doesn't love a good underdog story? And the Big 12 has its fair share of Cinderellas waiting to happen. As I looked over the preseason poll, I couldn't help but chuckle at the optimism (or pessimism, depending on your team) surrounding each squad.

The Kansas Jayhawks, perennial powerhouses, were expected to dominate once again. But, as we've seen time and time again, the Big 12 is a league that thrives on upsets. The Jayhawks would have to navigate a talented Baylor Bears team, not to mention the feisty Texas Tech Red Raiders, who always seem to bring their A-game.

Meanwhile, teams like the Iowa State Cyclones and Oklahoma Sooners were flying under the radar, waiting to make their mark. And let's not forget the West Virginia Mountaineers, who always seem to punch above their weight.

As I reflect on the season that could have been, I'm reminded of the resilience and determination that defines college basketball. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic throwing a wrench into the works, the players, coaches, and fans persevered. We adapted to a new normal, with empty arenas and socially distanced cheers.

In the end, it was a season that tested our resolve, but also reminded us of the power of sports to bring people together. As we look ahead to the next season, I'm excited to see what the Big 12 has in store. Will Kansas continue their reign? Can Baylor keep the momentum going? And which underdog will steal our hearts?

One thing's for sure - the 2021-22 Big 12 college basketball season is shaping up to be a thrilling ride. So, grab your favorite team's gear, get ready to cheer on your squad, and let's make some noise. It's time to tip off another unforgettable season of March Madness.
