>## The Unexpected Lesson from a Limping Boxer

It's been a strange year, hasn't it? 2020 threw curveballs at everyone, and my perspective on sports shifted in a way I never anticipated. I’ve always been a die-hard basketball fan, living and breathing every game. But lockdowns and empty arenas… it felt hollow. 

Then, my goofy, giant Boxer, Gus, started struggling with his back. The vet suspects a possible surgery down the line, and navigating the stairs for potty breaks became a delicate dance. Suddenly, I was obsessively focused on *his* movements, his balance, his pain. 

It was a bizarre parallel. I used to analyze players' agility, their recoveries, their ability to overcome obstacles. Now, I was doing the same for my dog. And I realized, the resilience, the determination to keep going even when things are tough… that’s the real beauty of it all. Whether it's on a court or helping a clumsy pup down the stairs, it’s about pushing through. Maybe that’s the lesson 2020 was trying to teach me.
