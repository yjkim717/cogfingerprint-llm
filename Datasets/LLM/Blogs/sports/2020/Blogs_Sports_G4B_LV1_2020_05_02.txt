**Remembering That Lost Game (and a Whole Lot of Uncertainty)**

It’s weird to think about 2020 now, isn’t it? So much shifted, so much felt…uncertain. I was really invested in my local rugby team’s season, and we were on a roll heading into the playoffs.  We lost the semi-final – a tough, close game – and honestly, it stung. 

But more than the loss itself, it was the *feeling* surrounding it. The stadium was half-empty, masks were mandatory, and there was this palpable sense that everything was just…different.  It made celebrating feel a little strange, and the post-game commiseration even more subdued.  It was a reminder that even in the midst of a sport we love, life throws curveballs, and sometimes you just have to accept the outcome.  It’s a memory I still hold, a little slice of a uniquely challenging year.
