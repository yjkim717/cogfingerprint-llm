## The Unexpected Loyalty I Found for the Padres in 2020

Remember 2020? A year of… well, everything feeling a little off. I wasn't a die-hard baseball fan, hadn’t really followed the Padres closely. But something about the bubble season, the strange quiet of the stadium, and the underdog spirit of that team just *clicked*. 

I found myself genuinely invested, cheering for guys I barely knew. There was a certain camaraderie, a shared hope amidst the chaos. It wasn’t about winning a championship (though that would have been nice!), it was about supporting a team fighting through unprecedented circumstances. It was a reminder that sometimes, unexpected loyalties bloom in the most unusual of seasons. And honestly, I’m still rooting for them.
