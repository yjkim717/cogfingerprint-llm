The year 2020 was supposed to be my season. I’d trained all winter, muscles coiled like springs, ready for the starting gun. Then, the world just… stopped. Tracks were empty, stadiums silent. My biggest competitor wasn't another runner, but the four walls of my living room.

I learned then that the heart of sport isn't the roar of a crowd, but the quiet discipline of a solo jog at dawn. It was a year we all ran a different kind of race—one of patience and resilience. And in that, perhaps, we all won something far more valuable.
