**A Split Victory? Thinking About the Fulmer Cup**

Okay, 2020 was… a year, right? And college football was no exception. I was completely thrown for a loop when I heard about the Fulmer Cup. You know, the annual rivalry game? Well, thanks to some crazy scheduling shifts, they’re doing a “split season” this year – meaning two teams will actually be crowned champions! 

It just feels a little strange, doesn't it?  Usually, there’s one clear winner, one definitive moment of glory. But this feels like acknowledging a different kind of victory, a recognition of two teams deserving the title. 

I’m really curious to see how the ratings will play out with this format. Will fans embrace the dual champions, or will they still crave that single, decisive outcome?  Either way, it’s a fascinating shift, and honestly, a reminder that even in sports, things can change in unexpected ways.
