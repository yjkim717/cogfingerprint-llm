>## A Most Unusual Year, A Most Unusual Trophy

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn't it? It’s been a year of adjustments, of pivots, of redefining “normal” in almost every aspect of our lives. And college football, a beloved tradition for so many, was no exception. We watched games get postponed, stadiums stand empty, and the entire season feel… precarious.

It's easy to feel a little lost when things you rely on are disrupted. For me, college football has always been a comforting constant – Saturdays spent cheering with friends, the thrill of a last-minute touchdown, the camaraderie of rivalries. This year, that felt different.

But amidst the uncertainty, something pretty remarkable happened. The folks at the College Football Performance Awards, recognizing the unique landscape of 2020, decided to do something truly fitting: they're awarding *two* Fulmer Cups this year. One to the team that dominated the fall season, and another to those whose seasons were pushed back. 

It’s a symbolic gesture, really. Acknowledging that everyone faced different challenges, different timelines, and different circumstances. It's a reminder that sometimes, a little flexibility and understanding can create something meaningful, even in the most unusual of years. Maybe we can all take a page from the Fulmer Cup's playbook and embrace a bit of that adaptability ourselves.
