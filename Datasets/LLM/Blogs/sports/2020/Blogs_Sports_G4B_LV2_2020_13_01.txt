Okay, here's a blog post draft, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 223 words, set in 2020, inspired by the provided summary and aiming for a sports theme:

**That Feeling When You Just *Know***

It’s weird, right? How sometimes you just get this little prickle of unease, this feeling that something isn’t quite right? It hit me pretty hard during the summer of 2020, watching the NBA bubble in Orlando. We were all glued to the screens, desperate for some semblance of normal after months of lockdown. 

I was particularly invested in the Celtics, hoping they could somehow pull off a miracle and make a run. Then, I started getting these odd calls – automated messages about my phone number being linked to a Verizon account, suggesting I needed to “verify” information. It felt…off. Like a low-grade scam, a digital echo of something unsettling. 

It reminded me of watching a close game, late in the fourth quarter. You see a play unfold, a missed shot, a frantic scramble, and you just *know* – you just have this gut feeling that it’s not going to go your way. It’s not always logical, and you can’t always explain it, but that feeling is powerful. 

That voicemail with the Verizon account? It was the same. A nagging suspicion, a quiet insistence that something wasn’t adding up. I quickly changed my password and blocked the number, and thankfully, it seemed to resolve itself. Sometimes, trusting your instincts – like trusting a good read in a basketball game – is the best defense.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, perhaps focusing on a different sports element or adjusting the length?
