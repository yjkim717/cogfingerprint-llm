The year 2020 taught us to never take the small things for granted. As Week 4 of the NFL season approached, the simple act of looking up the gameday info for the Saints vs. Lions felt like a luxury. Would the game even happen? The injury reports from both teams felt secondary to the larger, looming question of whether the season could continue in its strange, fan-less bubble.

Thinking about Ford Field, usually a roaring cauldron of sound, sitting in near silence was surreal. It was a stark reminder that the heart of sports isn't just the final score, but the shared experience. That season, every completed pass, every broadcast we could tune into, felt like a small victory against the chaos. It was football, but it was also a lesson in resilience, reminding us why we love the game in the first place.
