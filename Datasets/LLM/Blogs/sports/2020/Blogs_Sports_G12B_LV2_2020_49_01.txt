## Remember That Feeling? The Upset That Still Stings (and Thrills)

2020 has been… a lot, hasn’t it? It’s made us appreciate the unexpected, the moments where the script gets completely thrown out the window. And thinking about that, it reminded me of a UFC fight I witnessed a few years back – Shana Dobson versus Mariya Agapova.

Honestly, I don’t think many people saw *that* coming. Agapova was the favorite, the one with the hype. But Dobson? She just… *did*. It was a stunning upset, and apparently, statistically, the biggest in UFC history, even bigger than Rousey vs. Holm!

There's something electric about watching an underdog defy all expectations. It’s a reminder that anything can happen, that hard work and heart can truly triumph. It’s a feeling I think we could all use a little more of right now. What's a sports upset that completely surprised you?
