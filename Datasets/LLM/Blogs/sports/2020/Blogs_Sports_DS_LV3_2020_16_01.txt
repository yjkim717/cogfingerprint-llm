There’s something almost poetic about LSU hoisting the College Football Belt in 2020. In a year defined by uncertainty and empty stadiums, this quirky, fan-driven tradition felt like a grounding force—a thread connecting us to the sport's raw, unscripted origins.

I remember watching that decisive win over South Carolina, a game where the Tigers didn't just play; they laid claim to a legacy. It wasn't just about rankings or bowl projections. It was about lineage—the idea that with one great performance, you carry forward a story that began long before any of us were here.

Now, Auburn waits. The belt is on the line again, and I can’t help but feel that thrill of anticipation. It’s a reminder that even in a fractured season, some rivalries and rituals remain untouchable. This belt isn’t a trophy you’ll find in a case, but it lives in the heart of the game—and in moments like these, you remember why college football still feels like magic.
