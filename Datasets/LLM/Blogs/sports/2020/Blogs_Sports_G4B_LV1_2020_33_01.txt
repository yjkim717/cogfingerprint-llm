**The Ghosts of Detroit: Why the Packers Can’t Seem to Finish**

Seriously, does anyone else find it *weird* how often the Packers just… let the lead slip away against the Lions? It's become a running joke, hasn’t it?  We’ve been watching it for four straight seasons now, and it’s like a stubborn, repeating nightmare. 

Last year, we were up by double digits in the third quarter – a *huge* lead – and then… boom.  The Lions clawed their way back. It’s frustrating beyond belief.  You’d think, after all this time, we’d have figured out how to close it out. 

Maybe it's the energy of Ford Field, maybe it's a psychological thing. Whatever it is, the Packers need to break this cycle.  It’s a frustrating pattern to watch, and one that’s starting to feel a little too familiar.  Anyone else feeling this tension heading into the season series?
