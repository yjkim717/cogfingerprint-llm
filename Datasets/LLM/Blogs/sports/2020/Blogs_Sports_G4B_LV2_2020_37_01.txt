**Remembering the Year the Heisman Felt…Off**

2020 was a strange year for college football, wasn’t it? I spent way too much time scrolling through Reddit threads, dissecting the Heisman Trophy race.

It really got me thinking about how much we value flash over substance sometimes.  Anyone else feel that frustration? #CFB #HeismanTrophy #SportsDebate
