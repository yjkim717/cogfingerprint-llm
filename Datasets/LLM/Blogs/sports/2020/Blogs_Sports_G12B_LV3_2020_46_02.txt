## Five Points and a Feeling

Remember 2020? A year that felt… unusual, to say the least. Even the NFL threw us a curveball. It's wild to think that five different teams – the Vikings, Buccaneers, Colts, and Seahawks among them – all managed to score *exactly* five points in a single quarter. A statistic so rare, it hadn’t happened since 1949! It just felt like another quirky reminder that even in the familiar world of football, 2020 was rewriting the rules.
