### The Day My Digital Gym Kicked Me Out

It was March 2020, and the world had just pulled the plug on my local gym. Like so many others, I turned to the digital world for my fitness fix. My sanctuary became a certain subreddit—a bustling, sweaty, and often brutally honest online community. It was my source for new routines, form checks, and that much-needed motivational push.

I’d been a loyal member for years, but everything changed over a single post. I shared a personal story about finally breaking a weight-loss plateau, focusing on the mental hurdle of maintaining a calorie deficit when stuck inside 24/7. It was raw and, I thought, relatable.

Within an hour, it was gone. Deleted by a moderator for violating a rule I’d apparently misread. Frustrated, I sent a polite message asking for clarification. The response was a cold, automated-sounding paragraph, followed by something that felt like a punch to the gut: a permanent ban.

Just like that, the digital doors slammed shut. I was exiled.

The irony wasn’t lost on me. In a year defined by isolation, I’d managed to get myself kicked out of one of my few remaining social spaces. The initial anger was fierce. How could they be so rigid? Weren't we all just trying to stay sane?

But as the days passed, the anger cooled into a strange lesson. That community, for all its knowledge, was just a structure. My fitness, my progress, my discipline—that was all mine. The ban forced me to stop looking outward for validation and to trust the process I was building for myself. I started a simple workout journal, disconnected from the noise of upvotes and critiques.

Sometimes, the hardest reps aren’t the physical ones, but the ones that teach you to be your own best coach. Losing that community felt like a setback, but it taught me that the most important fitness space isn't a gym or a forum; it's the six inches between your ears.
