## Does Anyone Remember the Glory Days of Activision CoD Events?

Okay, fellow Call of Duty fans, I need to tap into the collective memory! Back in the Modern Warfare 2 or 3 era – probably around 2010-2012? – Activision ran this *amazing* series of events. I’m talking serious production value, like, broadcast-quality stuff. Pro teams battling it out, and what really made it special was a celebrity commentator calling the shots. 

It felt like a real turning point for competitive Call of Duty, a glimpse of what esports could become. I've been trying to dig up details, but it's surprisingly elusive. Anyone else remember this? Let's reminisce! It's making me nostalgic for a simpler, yet incredibly exciting, time in the CoD scene.
