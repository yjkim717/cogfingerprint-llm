The year 2020 was supposed to be my season. After a decade of competitive running, I’d finally qualified for the marathon I’d dreamed of since I was a teenager. My training was dialed in, my body felt strong, and then, the world stopped. Races were canceled, tracks were closed, and my singular goal vanished overnight.

At first, the anxiety was overwhelming. My identity was so wrapped up in that finish line that without it, I felt utterly lost. I’d go for a run just to feel some normalcy, but my heart wasn’t in it. The pressure to stay in peak condition without a race to target felt pointless.

The turning point came on a slow, meandering jog I took just to get out of the house. I wasn’t tracking my pace or mileage. I was just moving. I noticed the cherry blossoms were in full bloom—a spectacle I usually missed because I was too focused on my split times. In that moment, I accepted a new reality: my purpose in sport had to shift. It wasn't about a time on a clock or a medal; it was about the simple, grounding act of putting one foot in front of the other.

Letting go of the external validation didn’t diminish my love for running; it purified it. In a year of immense uncertainty, lacing up my shoes became my constant—a small, personal victory of perseverance over panic. It taught me that sometimes, the most important race is the one that has no finish line at all.
