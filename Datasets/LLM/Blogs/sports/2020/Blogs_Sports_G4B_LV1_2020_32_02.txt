**The ACC’s Shifting Landscape – And Why It Feels Weird**

Okay, so I’ve been following the ACC’s scheduling changes pretty closely, and honestly, it’s a bit… unsettling. You remember how every year, the big schools would snag some cool non-conference games – maybe a trip to a good Pac-12 program or a flashy matchup against a Group of Five school? 

This year’s new rules, limiting those games to within conference states, feels like a shift. It’s a deliberate attempt to boost the G5 schools, which is good in theory, but it also makes the ACC schedule feel a little… contained. Conference football is great, don’t get me wrong, but a little bit of that broader, exciting competition is missing. It's like they’re building a really solid little league, but losing some of the wider appeal. What do you guys think?
