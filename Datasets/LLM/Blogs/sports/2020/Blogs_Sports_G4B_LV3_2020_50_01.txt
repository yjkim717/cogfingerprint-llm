**The Silent Exchange**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was a scramble, right? I found myself constantly sharing my phone number – to reschedule training, to coordinate group runs, just to stay connected during lockdowns. And I realized something: I was rushing the exchange. 

I’d blurt it out without pausing, assuming everyone was listening. But sometimes, people missed it. It led to frustrating follow-ups, a little test of patience. It made me think about the value of a simple, clear connection. 

Maybe it’s about slowing down, taking a breath before sharing that vital piece of information. A little courtesy, a moment of focus – it actually makes communication more efficient, and honestly, it feels good to be considerate, even in a world that demanded so much speed.
