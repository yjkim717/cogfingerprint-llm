**The Weight of the Jersey**

2020 felt…heavy. Like wearing a jersey that was a size too small, restricting every move.  I watched athletes – Federer, LeBron – navigating impossible challenges, their dominance a stark contrast to our collective struggle. It made me think about power dynamics, about the unspoken pressures within teams, the subtle hierarchies.  Like Marx and Engels charting a revolutionary course, or Lenin pushing for a singular vision, there’s a certain intensity in striving for victory.  Sometimes, that drive can feel… unsettling.  It’s a reminder that even in sport, complex forces are always at play.
