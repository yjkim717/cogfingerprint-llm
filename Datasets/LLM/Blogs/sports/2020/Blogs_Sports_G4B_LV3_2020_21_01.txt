**Remembering the 2020 College Football Frenzy**

2020… it feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? I was scrolling through Reddit a few months back, just killing time, and stumbled across this crazy poll in r/CFB. It was all about the college football rankings, and surprisingly, Alabama was sitting pretty at the very top. 

Honestly, it struck me how fiercely contested things felt back then. Notre Dame and Ohio State were right on their heels – a real three-way battle for supremacy. It wasn’t just about wins and losses; it was this palpable sense of excitement, of believing any team could pull off an upset. 

Looking back, it’s a reminder that even in the midst of a chaotic year, sports can still offer a shared sense of passion and a snapshot of a particular moment in time.  Do you remember feeling that way too?
