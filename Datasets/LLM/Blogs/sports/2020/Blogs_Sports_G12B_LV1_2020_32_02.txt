## The Quiet Loss of Tradition: College Football Scheduling in a Strange Year

It's 2020, and everything feels… different. We’re navigating a pandemic, a political landscape that’s more fractured than ever, and now, even college football scheduling feels fundamentally altered. The ACC’s announcement about limiting non-conference games to in-state opponents really hit me the other day. It's a practical move, sure, born out of safety concerns, but it feels like a quiet loss, too.

I remember growing up, eagerly anticipating those out-of-state matchups. The mystique of a team traveling from across the country, the clash of different playing styles – it all added to the excitement. Think about the potential games we’re missing out on now. The smaller G5 programs, the chance for a power conference team to prove themselves on a national stage... it’s all dialed back.

It’s particularly bittersweet considering the already unusual season. We’re all craving a sense of normalcy, and for many of us, college football represents that.  But this new scheduling model feels like another layer of strangeness. I get the reasoning – minimizing travel, keeping players safe – but I can't shake the feeling that we’re sacrificing a little bit of the tradition, that spark of anticipation that made Saturdays in the fall so special. Hopefully, this is just a temporary adjustment, and we’ll get those exciting, cross-country rivalries back sooner rather than later.
