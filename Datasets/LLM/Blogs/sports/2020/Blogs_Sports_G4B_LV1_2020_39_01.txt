**The Year My Game Was Rebuilt**

2020 was… rough, right? For everyone. And for me, it felt like my own personal game was completely stalled. I’d been letting my credit slip, relying too much on credit cards and not paying them off. It was a frustrating cycle, and my credit score reflected it. 

I started 2021 with a real determination to change things. It felt like a long, slow rebuild, a bit like a pitcher working on their curveball – lots of practice and adjustments. I focused on paying down balances, really digging into my credit utilization.  It helped just knowing I was taking control. 

Honestly, it wasn’t about a flashy win, but the steady progress felt huge. It’s a reminder that even when things feel like they’re falling apart, you *can* rebuild – one step, one payment, at a time.
