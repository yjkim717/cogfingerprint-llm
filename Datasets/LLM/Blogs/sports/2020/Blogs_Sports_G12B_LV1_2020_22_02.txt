## The Unexpected Pivot: When My Knees Said "No"

Remember 2020? The year everything felt… off-kilter? Mine started with a vengeance. I was *really* into my weekend basketball league. Seriously, I was feeling it. Thought I was back in my college glory days, you know? Turns out, my body had other plans.

It was a particularly brutal game, lots of scrambling for rebounds, and then… a sharp pain in my knee. Not a dramatic collapse, just a slow, sinking feeling that something was definitely wrong. The diagnosis wasn't pretty: a meniscus tear. Suddenly, my regular routine of drills and games was replaced with ice packs and physiotherapy.

It felt like another layer of disruption piled on top of everything else happening in the world. Just when I started to feel a rhythm, something shifted. It forced me to re-evaluate. I couldn’t control the injury, but I *could* control how I responded. 

Instead of dwelling on what I *couldn't* do, I focused on strengthening what I *could*. I started yoga, really dug into core work, and even learned a surprisingly decent handstand. It wasn’t basketball, but it was movement, it was progress, and it was a reminder that sometimes, the most unexpected pivots lead to new strengths.  And honestly, my balance is better than ever. Maybe that's a win in itself.
