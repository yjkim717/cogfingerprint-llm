**The Runner's Block (and a Whole Lot of Leaks!)**

Okay, real talk. 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic and everything else, my running felt like a lifeline. I was pushing myself, trying to recapture some semblance of normalcy, and honestly, feeling pretty good. Then, around 32 weeks into my pregnancy, things started to shift. 

Suddenly, I was experiencing these *unexpected* bladder leaks – during my runs, while just walking! It was mortifying. Looking back, I realize I was holding it, trying to power through the discomfort, just like I always did. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? As a runner, I’m all about listening to my body. But in the third trimester, it felt like I was ignoring a very clear signal. If only I could tell my past self to slow down, breathe, and prioritize those leaks over pushing for a personal best.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest victories are about recognizing when to adjust and take care of yourself.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
