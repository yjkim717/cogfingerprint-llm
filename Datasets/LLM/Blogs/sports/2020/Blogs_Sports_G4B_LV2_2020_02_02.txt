**The Long Run & the Unexpected Turn**

2020 felt like a year of pushing limits, right? I was training for a half marathon, meticulously logging miles, obsessing over pace. Then, my old Border Collie, Gus, twisted his ankle during a walk. Suddenly, my carefully planned schedule went sideways. 

It made me realize something huge: sometimes, the best athletes – and the best humans – need to slow down. Gus needed a ramp to get onto the couch, a gentle nudge down the stairs. It wasn’t the victory I’d envisioned, but it was a reminder that support and adaptation are just as important as speed and strength.
