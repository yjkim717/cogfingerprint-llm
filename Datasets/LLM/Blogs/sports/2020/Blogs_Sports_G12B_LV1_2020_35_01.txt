## Finding My Miles (and My Community) in a Weird Year

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn't it? A year of lockdowns, canceled plans, and a general sense of…uncertainty. For me, like for so many others, it became a year of seeking solace in the simple things. And for me, that solace came in the form of running.

I'd always been an on-again, off-again runner. A few 5ks here, a half-hearted attempt at a training plan there. But when the world shut down, my usual gym routines vanished, and my social life…well, it mostly existed through screens. Suddenly, pounding the pavement felt like one of the few things I *could* control.

It started small, just around the block. Then, as the weeks stretched on, I found myself craving longer routes, exploring new neighborhoods. And somewhere along the way, I stumbled upon r/running. 

Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. I’d dabbled in subreddits before, but most felt a little…intense. But r/running? It was different. There was a genuine sense of camaraderie, a willingness to share advice (no matter how basic!), and a surprising amount of humor.  I'd scroll through threads about everything from blister prevention to the best running shoes, and always found a friendly face.

It’s fascinating to see how a niche online community can become such a vital support system.  I started participating myself, asking questions, sharing my own struggles (and occasional small victories!).  It’s comforting to know you’re not alone in cursing hills, or celebrating a new personal best.  

I’ve noticed the moderators are really working to keep things fresh, periodically reviving old threads and starting new ones. It's a smart move; it prevents the same questions from being asked repeatedly and encourages new voices to join the conversation. It's a little reminder that even online spaces can benefit from a bit of curation and intentionality.

This year has been a strange one, to say the least. But finding those miles, and finding that community, has made it a little less strange, a little less lonely, and a lot more…grounded. Turns out, sometimes the best therapy is a good run and a supportive online forum. Who knew?
