**The Year the Polls Just… Didn’t Quite Click**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was a little…off. And honestly, the AP Poll felt a bit that way too. I spent a ridiculous amount of time staring at those data visualizations – Reddit threads breaking down voter consistency – and it was wild to see how often opinions shifted. 

It wasn’t just about the rankings themselves, though. It was the *why* behind them.  One week a team was soaring, the next they were suddenly plummeting, and the voters seemed to be reacting to something beyond just wins and losses.  

It made me think about how easily we get caught up in the moment, how quickly narratives change.  Like college basketball, where a single upset could completely rewrite the season’s story.  Maybe the AP Poll, even with all its data, is just reflecting our own tendency to look for patterns where maybe there aren’t any – or at least, not as consistently as we think.
