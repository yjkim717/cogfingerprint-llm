**The Echo Chamber of the Forum**

Remember 2020? It felt like the internet was *always* on, a constant, low-level hum of opinions and outrage. I dove headfirst into a few sports forums – specifically, one dedicated to fantasy football – trying to strategize my way to a championship. It seemed like a relatively harmless activity, a bit of friendly competition. 

Then, it happened. I politely challenged a moderation decision regarding a flagged player, simply asking for clarification. What followed wasn't clarification; it was a tidal wave of responses. Suddenly, my question was framed as an attack, a sign of disrespect. The argument spiraled, fueled by rapid-fire replies and escalating personal jabs. 

It felt… exhausting. Like being trapped in a digital echo chamber, where every attempt at reasoned discussion was met with increasingly hostile counterpoints. Before I knew it, I was receiving a perma-ban. 

Looking back, it was a stark reminder of how easily online interactions can devolve into unproductive drama. It highlighted the frustrating reality of miscommunication and how quickly a simple question can ignite a firestorm.  It made me realize that sometimes, the most productive thing to do is simply step away.  Maybe 2020 taught us all a valuable lesson about the boundaries of online engagement – and the importance of recognizing when a conversation has gone too far.
