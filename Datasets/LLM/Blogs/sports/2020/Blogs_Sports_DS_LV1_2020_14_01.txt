### The Unwritten Season

I remember staring at the preseason poll last fall, the ink on the page feeling more like a wish than a prediction. 2020 had already taken so much, and there we were, trying to map out a college basketball season as if things were normal. The Big 12 looked like a beast, with Kansas and Texas Tech poised to battle for the crown. We had the storylines ready: the veteran coaches, the star players, the inevitable drama of the conference tournament.

But the whole time, there was this low hum in the background, a collective anxiety we were all trying to ignore. It was the year of the "what if."

What if a key player tests positive before the big game? What if a team gets a postseason ban from some long-forgotten NCAA violation, rendering the whole grind meaningless? The transfer portal was buzzing louder than ever, a revolving door of kids seeking a fresh start in a world that had no stability to offer. It felt less like team-building and more like assembling a life raft in the middle of a storm.

We talk about sports in absolutes—wins, losses, championships. But the 2020-21 season was a lesson in the conditional tense. It was about the games that might not be played, the seasons that could be paused, the arenas that would remain silent. That preseason analysis, all our confident chatter about Kansas’s defense and Texas Tech’s rebounding, felt almost quaint. The real opponent wasn't wearing a different jersey; it was an invisible, unpredictable virus.

In the end, the season was a testament to pure love of the game. Every tip-off was a small victory. Every completed schedule was a miracle. The journey to the NCAA Tournament wasn't just about seeding; it was about navigating a minefield of uncertainty to even get there.

It made me realize we often focus on the destination—the cutting down of the nets—but that year, the triumph was in the simple, stubborn act of playing. It was messy, imperfect, and fraught with anxiety, but it was also beautiful. It reminded us that sometimes, the most profound stories aren't about who wins the title, but about the sheer resilience it takes to even finish the race.
