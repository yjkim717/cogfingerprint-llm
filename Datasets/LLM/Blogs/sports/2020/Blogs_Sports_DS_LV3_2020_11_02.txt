As I lace up my running shoes in this quiet summer of 2020, I can’t help but think of Mike, away on his writing sabbatical to finish his book. It reminds me of my own break from team sports—the solitude, the focus. Like him, I’m using this time to rebuild, refine my skills, and reflect. I wonder when he’ll return, just as I look forward to reuniting with my teammates, stronger and more centered after this unexpected season apart.
