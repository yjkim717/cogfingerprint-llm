As I watched the 2020 Olympics unfold, I couldn't help but fantasize about the discipline and control required in sports like gymnastics. The way athletes submit to rigorous training, pushing their bodies to the limit, resonated with my own experiences with kink and BDSM. The trust, communication, and mutual respect between partners mirrored the dynamics between coaches and athletes. I pondered the parallels between the two worlds, where boundaries are pushed and strength is forged. It was a fascinating lens through which to view the Games, and one that left me in awe of the athletes' unyielding dedication.
