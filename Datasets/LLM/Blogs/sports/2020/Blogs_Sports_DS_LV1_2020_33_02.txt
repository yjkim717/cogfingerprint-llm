**Title: A Fond Farewell to Gloria**

Well, everyone, the day has finally come. After many months of sharing this little digital paradise, Gloria the duck is officially in boxes and ready to move on to new horizons.

I know her "snooty" personality can be a bit much at first—she’s definitely given my fashion choices a side-eye or two—but beneath that refined exterior is a truly kind villager. She’s always had a surprisingly thoughtful piece of advice after a long day of fishing and bug-catching.

It’s bittersweet to see her go, but my island gate is open for anyone who’d like to give this fabulous feathered friend a wonderful new home. She deserves a island that appreciates her unique charm!

**The Year We Relearned the Game**

Remember March 2020? The eerie silence. Stadiums that should have been roaring were empty, and the seasonal rhythm of sports just… stopped. My cleats gathered dust in the garage, and for the first time, I realized how much of my identity was tied to being on a team.

That forced pause was a gift in disguise. Without the weekly games, I started running alone, not for a trophy, but for my sanity. The "sport" became a simple act of moving, of feeling the sun on my face. It stripped competition down to its purest form: a personal challenge. When our rec league tentatively returned with masked, distanced practices, the high-fives felt more meaningful. We weren't just playing a game anymore; we were reclaiming a piece of the connection we’d lost.
