## The Allure of the First Try

Okay, Sporcle addicts, let's talk badges. Specifically, those tricky minefield quizzes. I stumbled across a thread the other day about the "June Kaboom" badge – a whopping 150 minefield plays! It got me thinking: shouldn’t a badge celebrate the *first* time you conquer a challenge, not just sheer repetition? There’s something special about that initial burst of effort, right? Maybe Sporcle should consider it. Just a thought!
