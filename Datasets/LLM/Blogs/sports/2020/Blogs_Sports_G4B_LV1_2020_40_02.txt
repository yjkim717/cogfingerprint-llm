**The Quiet Thrill of a Test Drive**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2020, with everyone glued to screens, I found myself craving the simple joy of a test drive. I’m seriously considering a VW Sportwagen – that classic, understated appeal. I’m particularly curious about the 1.8 engine and how it feels in the driver’s seat. More than just specs, I want to *know* the handling. It’s about that quiet thrill of connecting with a machine, a feeling I desperately needed.  Wish me luck on my search!
