## The Week College Football Gave Us Hope (and a Whole Lot of Debate)

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn't it? We’ve all been navigating a world that felt…shifted. Uncertainty was the name of the game, and honestly, sometimes the only thing that felt reliably consistent was the chaos. And yet, somehow, amidst all of that, college football persevered. And for a few glorious Saturdays, it gave us a much-needed dose of normalcy, a flicker of excitement, and something to genuinely talk about besides, well, *everything else*.

I remember scrolling through Reddit that November, specifically November 17th, 2020. The /r/CFB poll was live, and the debate was *fierce*. It was a snapshot of the season, really. Alabama, Notre Dame, and Ohio State were battling it out for the top spot, and the discussion reflected the intensity on the field. Alabama, as always, was a force, their dominance undeniable. But Notre Dame’s surprising run, spearheaded by Ian Book, felt like a genuine underdog story – a breath of fresh air in a landscape often dominated by powerhouses. And Ohio State? They were just…Ohio State. Consistently excellent, but always facing that hurdle of proving they could truly contend for the championship.

What struck me wasn’t just the rankings themselves, but *why* people felt the way they did. It was the passionate arguments about strength of schedule, the meticulous breakdowns of each team’s offensive and defensive performances, the sheer, unadulterated love for the game. It was a community, uniting over something that felt, for a little while, like it could offer a sense of stability.

Looking back, it's funny how much weight we placed on these polls, these rankings. In the grand scheme of things, they’re just opinions, aggregated and presented in a neat little list. But in 2020, they felt like a lifeline. A reason to connect, to debate, to feel *something* other than anxiety. 

The season, of course, had its twists and turns. The playoff picture remained a tangled mess. But for that one week, that one poll, we had a moment of clarity, a collective sigh of excitement, and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there’s always something to rally around.  And sometimes, that something is just a really good college football game.
