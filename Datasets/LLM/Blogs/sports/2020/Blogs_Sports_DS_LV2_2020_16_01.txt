Of all the things 2020 took away, the simple joy of tradition felt like one of the biggest losses. That’s why stumbling upon the story of the College Football Belt this week felt like finding a hidden treasure. It’s not a real, physical trophy, but an idea—a "lineal national championship" passed down like a secret handshake from one champion to the next.

And right now, it belongs to the LSU Tigers.

In a year of empty stadiums and postponed games, this quirky, unofficial title feels more meaningful than any official ranking. It’s a thread connecting us to every team that has ever held it, a piece of pure, uncomplicated fandom. It’s not about polls or politics; it’s about one team having the bragging rights until someone takes them.

So next week, when LSU defends the Belt against Auburn, I’ll be watching. I’m not just watching for a win; I’m watching for that little spark of continuity, a reminder that some traditions, even the imaginary ones, can still thrive. In 2020, we hold onto whatever magic we can find.
