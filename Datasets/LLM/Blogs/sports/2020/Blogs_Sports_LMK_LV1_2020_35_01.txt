**A Marathon, Not a Sprint: Celebrating r/running's 1 Million Strong Community**

As I sat down to write this post in mid-2020, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. The r/running subreddit, a community I had been a part of for a while, had just hit a staggering 1 million subscribers. For those who aren't familiar, r/running is a forum on Reddit dedicated to all things running - from beginners looking for advice to seasoned marathoners sharing their latest PRs.

The community has come a long way since its inception, and its growth has been nothing short of phenomenal. As someone who's been actively participating in the subreddit, I've witnessed firsthand the impact it's had on people's lives. Whether it's providing motivation to get out for a run on a tough day or offering valuable advice on training and recovery, the r/running community has been a constant source of support and encouragement.

One of the key drivers of this growth has been the weekly threads that have become a staple of the community. Every Monday, we'd share our goals and motivations for the week ahead; every Wednesday, we'd post our mid-week check-ins; and every Friday, we'd share our favorite runs from the past week. These threads have not only fostered a sense of accountability but have also helped to create a sense of camaraderie among members.

As we celebrate this milestone, we're also taking a step back to reflect on what's working and what areas need improvement. With 1 million subscribers, it's clear that our weekly threads need to evolve to keep the community engaged. We're considering introducing new threads and formats to keep things fresh and exciting. The r/running community is more than just a forum - it's a group of like-minded individuals who share a passion for running. As we continue to grow and evolve, I'm excited to see what the future holds for this vibrant and supportive community. With a renewed focus on engagement and inclusivity, I'm confident that r/running will continue to be a go-to destination for runners of all levels.
