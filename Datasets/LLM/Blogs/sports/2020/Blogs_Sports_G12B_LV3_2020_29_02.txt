## The Unexpected Silence of My T300RS GT

It's strange, isn't it, when a piece of gear you rely on justâ€¦ stops? My Thrustmaster T300RS GT, my gateway to countless hours of sim racing, recently fell silent. The servo motor gave out. 2020 has been full of unexpected disruptions, and this felt like another frustrating one. Now, the hunt for a replacement begins, navigating supply shortages and hoping to get back to the track soon. Anyone else dealt with this?
