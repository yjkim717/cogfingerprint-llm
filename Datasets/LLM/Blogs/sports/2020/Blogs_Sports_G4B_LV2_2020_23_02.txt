**Remembering the Magic of 'The Zone'**

Honestly, 2020 was… a lot. But there were still moments of pure joy, and one that keeps popping back into my head is remembering the feeling of being *in the zone* during college basketball. It wasn’t about the star players, though they were incredible. It was about the guys who just… showed up.

Like Survivor’s casting, it felt like the coaches were looking for the real heart of the team, the guys who genuinely loved the game and were just happy to be there. Those were the players who’d make a hustle play, a perfect pass, and just *be* present. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most memorable moments aren't about flashy skills, but about that quiet dedication and the feeling of belonging – just like those fans who truly get Survivor.  It's a feeling I really miss.
