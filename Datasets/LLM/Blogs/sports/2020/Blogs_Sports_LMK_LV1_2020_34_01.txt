The 2019 college football season was a wild ride, and as we look back on it now, it's clear that some teams brought their A-game more often than others. As a fan, it's always exciting to relive the highlights and analyze what made certain performances stand out from the rest.

With that in mind, I've compiled a list of the top 100 college football game performances of 2019 based on game ratings. To determine these ratings, I considered a combination of factors, including the final score, the strength of the opposing team, and the overall dominance displayed by the winning team.

As I pored over the data, some familiar names began to emerge near the top of the list. LSU, Ohio State, Clemson, and Alabama were among the powerhouses that consistently delivered impressive performances throughout the season. But what was it about these teams that made them so successful?

Let's start with LSU. The Tigers finished the season with a national championship win over Clemson, and their game ratings reflected their strong play throughout the year. One standout performance came in a 45-38 win over Auburn, where quarterback Joe Burrow threw for 393 yards and four touchdowns. The Tigers' high-powered offense was nearly unstoppable that night, and their game rating of 94.2 reflected their dominance.

Ohio State was another team that consistently delivered strong performances in 2019. The Buckeyes finished the season with a Big Ten championship win over Wisconsin, and their game ratings were impressive throughout the year. One highlight came in a 62-0 thrashing of Cincinnati, where quarterback Justin Fields threw for 238 yards and three touchdowns. The Buckeyes' game rating of 92.5 in that contest reflected their thorough dominance.

Clemson, of course, was a force to be reckoned with in 2019. The Tigers finished the season with a strong performance in the national championship game, even if they ultimately came up short against LSU. One standout performance came in a 52-17 win over South Carolina, where quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns. Clemson's game rating of 91.8 in that contest reflected their convincing victory.

Alabama was another team that consistently delivered strong performances in 2019. The Crimson Tide finished the season with a strong showing in the SEC championship game, even if they ultimately came up short in the national championship. One highlight came in a 47-28 win over Auburn, where quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 418 yards and four touchdowns. Alabama's game rating of 90.9 in that contest reflected their impressive offense.

As I continued to review the top 100 game performances of 2019, it became clear that these four teams were among the most dominant forces in college football that season. But what was it about them that made them so successful? Was it their coaching, their talent, or something else entirely?

One factor that stood out to me was the strong quarterback play displayed by these teams. Burrow, Fields, Lawrence, and Tagovailoa were all among the top performers at their position in 2019, and their ability to make plays with their arms and legs was a key factor in their teams' success.

Another factor that contributed to the success of these teams was their strong team defense. LSU, Ohio State, Clemson, and Alabama were all among the top defensive teams in the country in 2019, and their ability to shut
