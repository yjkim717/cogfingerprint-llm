The 2020 college basketball preseason AP Poll - a snapshot of the nation's top teams, or so it seems. As I dug into the voter data, a fascinating story emerged. By analyzing how consistently voters ranked teams, I discovered some surprising trends. The voters were sorted by similarity, revealing a clear divide between those who shared similar views and the outliers who marched to their own beat. Some voters consistently ranked teams in a similar order, while others seemed to have a different radar altogether. It was intriguing to see which voters stood out as anomalies, and which teams were the beneficiaries (or victims) of their unique perspectives. As the season unfolded, I wondered: did the outlier voters have a crystal ball, or were they just taking a risk? Either way, their bold choices added a thrilling layer of complexity to the AP Poll's narrative.
