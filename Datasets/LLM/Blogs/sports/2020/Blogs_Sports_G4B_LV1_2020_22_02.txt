**The Unexpected Shift – and Why I Almost Quit**

Okay, 2020 was… a lot, right? But honestly, one of the weirdest things I went through was during my half-marathon training.  Around mile eight, I started feeling this *weird* pressure – like my bladder was about to burst, but it wasn’t quite there. It was completely baffling. 

I’m not going to lie, I seriously considered stopping. The discomfort was intense and distracting. It felt like my body was fighting against me, and I was frustrated. Looking back, I realize it was likely a combination of pregnancy hormones kicking in – I hadn’t told anyone yet – and the sheer physical demand. 

It taught me a huge lesson about listening to my body, even when I didn't understand why it was reacting that way.  Sometimes, the most unexpected shifts are the ones that force you to recalibrate.
