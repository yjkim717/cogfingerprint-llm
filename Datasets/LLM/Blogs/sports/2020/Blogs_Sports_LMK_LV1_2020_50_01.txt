"Coaching on the Field: A Lesson in Communication from 2020" 

During a chaotic 2020 soccer match, I yelled out a teammate's phone number to coordinate a post-game meetup. I rattled it off quickly, but soon realized my mistake. My teammate asked me to repeat it, and I had to slow down to ensure they got it right. It struck me that sharing numbers is like passing on the field â€“ clarity is key. By slowing down, we can avoid fumbles and ensure our message is received. A simple life pro tip that has stuck with me ever since.
