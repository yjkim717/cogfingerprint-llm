As I scrolled through the r/running subreddit in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and wonder at the community's explosive growth. The COVID-19 pandemic had brought the world to a standstill, but for runners, it seemed to have the opposite effect. With gyms closed and outdoor activities restricted, many turned to running as a way to stay active and sane. The subreddit, once a niche gathering place for enthusiasts, had become a thriving hub of activity.

As I browsed through the threads, I noticed that while the community was growing, engagement was starting to plateau. The usual recurring threads - "What's your running goal for the year?" and "Share your favorite running routes" - were still getting traction, but the conversations felt stale. It was as if the community was going through the motions, rather than really connecting with one another.

This got me thinking: how could we reinvigorate the community and encourage more meaningful interactions? One idea that struck me was to refresh the recurring threads. Instead of asking the same questions every week or month, why not try something new? For example, "What's the most challenging run you've done recently?" or "How do you stay motivated during the pandemic?" These types of questions could spark more nuanced and relatable discussions, and help to foster a deeper sense of connection among community members.

I proposed this idea to the moderators, and to my delight, they were receptive. We started experimenting with new thread ideas, and the response was overwhelmingly positive. Users began to share their personal struggles and triumphs, and the conversations that followed were rich and supportive. It was clear that by shaking things up, we had tapped into a deeper well of community participation.

As I reflect on this experience, I'm reminded that even in a virtual community, it's the human touch that matters. By refreshing our approach to recurring threads, we were able to create a more dynamic and engaging space for runners to connect and share their passion. If you're part of an online community, I encourage you to try something similar. Shake up your recurring threads and see what happens. You might just be surprised at the kind of conversations that ensue.
