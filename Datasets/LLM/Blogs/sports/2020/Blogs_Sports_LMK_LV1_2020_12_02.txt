"As I laced up my running shoes in the early days of 2020, I couldn't help but think about the perfect kick - not just any kick, but the one that gets you moving. Just like a punchy kick drum in Melodic House tracks by Axhello, a strong start to a run can be all the motivation you need. I recall struggling to find my rhythm, much like a producer tweaking their sound design. But with every step, I found my groove. As the world outside was changing, my runs became a constant, a reminder that with the right beat, anything is possible."
