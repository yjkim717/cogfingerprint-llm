## That Unexpected Canadian Fan & a Lesson in Small Business

Remember 2020? Everything felt… complicated. My little online store selling university shirts was no exception. We were running a small promotion, and suddenly, a customer in Canada placed an order. A *single* order, for less than $200. 

Immediately, my brain started buzzing about sales tax and duties – international ecommerce stuff I hadn't really dealt with before. It felt overwhelming! It got me thinking about all the small businesses out there, hustling and trying to navigate these regulations. 

Ultimately, we decided to keep it simple and absorb the costs. It wasn't about the money, really. It was about making a genuine fan happy and realizing that even a tiny sale across the border can be a reminder of the reach and potential of what we’re building. Sometimes, the little wins are the most meaningful.
