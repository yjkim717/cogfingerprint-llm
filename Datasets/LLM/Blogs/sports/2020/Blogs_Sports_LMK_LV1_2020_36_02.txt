I'm still reeling from the sports world's COVID-19 crash. As a novice investor, I watched in 2020 as airlines and hotels took a hit, and I wondered if it was a buying opportunity. Could I double my investment? It's the same with sports teams - will they bounce back? The coronavirus pandemic brought the sports world to a standstill, leaving fans and investors alike uncertain. I'm holding my breath, waiting to see if my favorite teams will recover. It's a gamble, but one I'm willing to take. Will they soar back to success, or will they stay grounded?
