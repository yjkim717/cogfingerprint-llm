As I stepped onto the field in 2020, the eerie silence was a far cry from the electric atmosphere I'm used to. The COVID-19 pandemic had turned sports on its head, and it felt like a neo-noir mystery unfolding before our eyes. The usual roar of the crowd was replaced with empty stands, a haunting reminder of the uncertainty that gripped the world. It was like being trapped in a cult, where the rituals and routines we once took for granted were now shrouded in mystery. As I looked out at the desolate landscape, I couldn't help but think of the surreal landscapes of Central Florida, where the fantastical world of Disney stands in stark contrast to the darkness that lurks beneath. Much like the "Florida Man" headlines that often make national news, the sport I love was struggling to stay afloat in a sea of chaos.
