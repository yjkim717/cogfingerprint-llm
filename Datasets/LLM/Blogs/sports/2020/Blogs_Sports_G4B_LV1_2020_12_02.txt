**Hunting for the Axhello Kick: A Melodic House Deep Dive**

Okay, let’s be honest – that ‘Revival’ kick drum from Axhello is *everywhere* in melodic house right now. It's that perfect blend of punch and clarity, and I’ve been obsessing over how to recreate it. My current approach is layering a tight, processed 909 with a subtle, heavily sidechained sample – something with a bit of a transient. 

The key, I think, is the processing. Lots of short, precise compression and a touch of saturation. It’s not about brute force; it’s about sculpting the attack.  I’m experimenting with different EQ cuts and subtle delays to really make it pop in the mix.  Wish me luck – this kick is proving trickier than it looks!

Remember March 2020? Everything just…stopped. Suddenly, the roar of the crowd at Fenway was replaced by the quiet hum of my laptop. I was a huge baseball fan, and the season got cut short mid-playoff run. It felt surreal, like a bad dream. 

I spent a lot of that time walking my dog, trying to find a routine.  We’d go to the park, watching the empty stands and imagining the game.  It wasn’t the same, obviously, but it was a small comfort.  There was a strange, shared sadness, a collective holding of breath for what *would* be.  It was a reminder that even the biggest moments can be snatched away, and that finding joy in the small things becomes even more important.
