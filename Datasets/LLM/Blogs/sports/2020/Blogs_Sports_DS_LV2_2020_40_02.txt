That first test drive in the 2018 Volkswagen Sportwagen back in early 2020 was a welcome escape. The world felt heavy, but sliding into that snug driver's seat was like putting on a familiar glove. The 1.8-liter engine hummed, and as I took a corner, the sharp handling made everything else fade away. It wasn't just a car; it was a brief, joyful reminder of the simple thrill of the drive, a small piece of normalcy when we needed it most.
