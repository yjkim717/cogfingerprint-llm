It’s 2020, and honestly, running has been my anchor. With so much isolation, lacing up my shoes and hitting the pavement became my escape—but it was the photos that brought us together. Every week, I’d scroll through that Reddit thread, smiling at snapshots of sunrise trails, rain-soaked paths, and triumphant finish-line grins. It wasn’t just about the miles; it was about sharing those small, human moments. Someone’s foggy morning jog, another’s quiet neighborhood loop—each picture whispered, "You’re not alone." Submitting my own felt vulnerable, but the community embraced it. In a year that asked us to stay apart, running and these weekly glimpses of perseverance kept us connected, one stride, one photo at a time.
