The infamous 1994 Philadelphia Eagles collapse still stings. Starting the season 7-2, they were on top of the NFC East. But a shocking seven-game losing streak derailed their playoff hopes. As I watch the 2020 Eagles navigate their own season, I'm reminded of that crushing disappointment. What if they had finished strong back then? Would it have changed the course of their history? The what-ifs still linger, a testament to the enduring power of sports to captivate and haunt us. The memories remain, a bittersweet reminder of the fragility of success.
