**The Unexpected Curveball of 2020**

Remember 2020? It felt like the whole world was playing a game with completely unpredictable rules. As a runner, I was training for a marathon – meticulously planning my pace, my nutrition, everything. Then, *bam*, everything shut down. Suddenly, my carefully constructed training schedule was just…gone. 

It was frustrating, honestly. Like trying to debug a really complicated Python function – I kept hitting errors I couldn’t fix.  I had to learn to validate my new “rules” – social distancing, limited training routes. 

But you know what? It forced me to adapt. Just like those Python functions need input validation, *I* needed to adjust my approach.  It wasn't the race I’d envisioned, but finding a new way to move, to challenge myself, felt surprisingly rewarding.  Sometimes, the best victories are the ones you didn't plan.
