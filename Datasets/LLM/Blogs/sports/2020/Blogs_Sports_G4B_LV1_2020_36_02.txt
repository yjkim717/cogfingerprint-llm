**Remembering March 2020: When the Stadiums Went Silent**

It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? March 2020. I was glued to the TV, watching the NBA bubble, the MLB trying to figure it out, and the NFL… well, the NFL just stopped. Suddenly, the roar of the crowd was gone, replaced by the echo of empty stadiums. 

It made me think about investing, too. Like a lot of people, I’d been tentatively dipping my toes in, maybe a little too eager to jump in on airline stocks – hoping for a quick win. But the 'stock crater’ of that moment, the sheer uncertainty, really shook things up. It was a brutal reminder that even the most exciting investments can be volatile.  It forced me to re-evaluate, prioritizing long-term strategy over chasing a quick profit.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post focused on a different sport or aspect of the original summary?
