## The Empty Gridiron and a Question of Fairness

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn’t it? It was a year that redefined “unprecedented” and threw curveballs at every corner of our lives. I remember the initial shock, the scrambling to adjust to working from home, the constant news updates… and the quiet, hollow feeling that settled in when the sports stopped.

For me, a lot of that feeling was tied to Canadian university football. I’ve always been a U Sports fan, appreciating the grit and the passion of players balancing their studies with the demands of the game. It felt like a genuine community. Then, *poof*, the 2020 season was gone. Canceled.

The reasoning, of course, was understandable. Public health, safety – all paramount. But the fallout was…complicated. And it brought up a lot of questions about fairness, particularly with the decision to introduce an age cap for players. 

I remember reading about the protests led by coaches like Chris Morris, and the growing discussion within the Canadian University Sport Football Coaches Association (CUSFCA). They argued, and I think with good reason, that this felt like a rushed decision, one that penalized older players – veterans who’d dedicated years to the program and were finally poised to lead their teams.

It wasn't just about the lost season, either. The age cap felt like a fundamental shift in the philosophy of U Sports. Was it still about providing opportunities for student-athletes of all ages, or was it becoming something else?

Looking back, it’s easy to see how frustrating it must have been for those players. They’d poured their hearts and souls into their training, their academics, and their teams, and then had the rug pulled out from under them. The legal challenges that followed felt almost inevitable – a desperate attempt to fight for what they believed was right.

The empty gridirons of 2020 were a stark reminder of how fragile things can be. They weren't just about the absence of a game; they were about the disruption of dreams, the questioning of fairness, and the unsettling feeling that the world had fundamentally changed. And as we moved forward, it left a lingering question: how do we rebuild, and how do we ensure that the values we cherish in sports – dedication, opportunity, and fairness – are preserved?
