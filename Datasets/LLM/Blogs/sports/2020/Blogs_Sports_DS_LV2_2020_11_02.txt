That summer of 2020, the stadiums were silent. No squeak of sneakers, no roar of the crowd. It felt like the game itself had taken an extended timeout. But in that quiet, I found a different kind of trainingâ€”patience. Sometimes the most important progress happens off the court, in the stillness, waiting for the right moment to make your comeback.
