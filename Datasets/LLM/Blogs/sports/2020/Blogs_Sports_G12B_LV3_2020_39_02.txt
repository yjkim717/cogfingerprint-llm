## The Unexpected Pause in the Game

Remember 2020? A year of unexpected pauses, right? It wasn't just the sports world shutting down; it felt like *everything* hit a temporary stop. I was supposed to be seriously considering a new car – a Subaru Outback, specifically. I even got pre-approved for financing through Bank of America, feeling pretty confident. 

But then, dealership after dealership kept pushing for their own financing applications, despite my pre-approval. It felt…off. Like a constant, low-level pressure. It made me question the whole process, and honestly, the brand itself. Was this standard practice? It certainly wasn't the feeling of trust and reliability I’d hoped for. It's a small thing, a car purchase, but it highlighted a bigger frustration with feeling pushed and pulled, even when you've already laid the groundwork.
