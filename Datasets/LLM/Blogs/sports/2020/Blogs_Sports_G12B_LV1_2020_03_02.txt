## The Ghosts of January and a Season Unlike Any Other

It's January 2021, and the echoes of the 2020 NFL season are still swirling around. Honestly, it feels like a fever dream. A season played amidst a pandemic, with empty stadiums, constant testing, and a pervasive sense of…unreality. And now, as Wild Card weekend kicks off, I find myself reflecting not just on the games ahead, but on *everything* that brought us here.

I remember back in the fall, the hype was real. Deshaun Watson was looking like a legitimate MVP contender, carrying the Texans on his back. Everyone was talking about him. And then… well, then the wheels started to wobble. It's easy to look back now with the benefit of hindsight, but at the time, you genuinely believed he could lead Houston to a Super Bowl run. The promise was shimmering.

And of course, there was Tom Brady. Even *after* leaving New England, even *after* arriving in Tampa Bay, the man just wouldn’t quit being Tom Brady. It felt almost… defiant. Seeing him in a different uniform, leading a different team, was jarring. But the football? The football was still Brady football. It was mesmerizing to watch, a reminder of his enduring dominance. We all knew it was possible, but still, witnessing it felt like something out of a movie.

Then there was Russell Wilson. Seattle was… well, Seattle was Seattle. Solid, dependable, but lacking that extra spark. Wilson, too, seemed to be battling a little something. The usual MVP conversation wasn't quite there. It was a strange feeling, seeing a player of his caliber not quite reaching his usual heights. It made you wonder, doesn’t it? What's the magic ingredient that elevates a player from good to truly transcendent?

Wild Card weekend in 2020… it was a particularly brutal one, wasn't it? So many upsets, so many narratives shattered. The Titans, battling COVID outbreaks, somehow roared into the playoffs and promptly dispatched the Patriots. The Steelers… oh, the Steelers. Ben Roethlisberger’s return from injury felt like a turning point, but it turned into a disaster against the Chiefs. That game… that game still stings a little. It felt like the end of an era, even if it wasn’t entirely clear what that era *was* anymore.

What struck me most about that weekend, and really about the entire 2020 season, was how fragile everything felt. The whole thing was balanced on a knife's edge. One positive test, one bad call, one unexpected injury, and a team’s season could be derailed. It made the victories feel less decisive, the losses even more crushing. Every win felt like a temporary reprieve, a brief moment of normalcy in a chaotic world.

It’s funny, the things you remember. Not necessarily the
