The 2020 offseason was anything but ordinary. With the college football schedule thrown for a loop, the Fulmer Cup committee had to get creative. To keep the competition fair and exciting, they made the bold decision to split the season into two separate segments. It was a move that generated some buzz among fans, but ultimately paid off. The split season format allowed teams to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of college football, and it added an extra layer of intrigue to the award categories. As we looked back on the Fulmer Cup season, it was clear that the committee's unorthodox approach was a success. The winners in each category were well-deserved, and the competition was fierce. In the end, the Fulmer Cup proved that even in the most uncertain times, the spirit of competition can thrive.
