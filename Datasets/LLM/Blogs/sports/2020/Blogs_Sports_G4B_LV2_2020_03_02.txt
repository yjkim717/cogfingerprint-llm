**The Ghosts of Wild Card – And a Whole Lot of Second-Guessing**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Looking back at 2020, a year that felt like a collective holding of breath, and suddenly you're diving back into the chaotic memory of the NFL playoffs. Specifically, that frantic, nail-biting Wild Card weekend. Honestly, just thinking about it now brings back a potent mix of excitement and, let’s be honest, a *serious* amount of regret.

I spent a ridiculous amount of time – probably far too much – crafting my 2020 playoff predictions. I felt like I had a handle on things, a little predictive superpower fueled by late-night football and too much caffeine. I even wrote a little post about it, outlining my picks and offering a bit of analysis on the key matchups.  

Looking back, it feels… humbling.  My record wasn’t terrible, sure, but it definitely wasn’t stellar. And the losses? They lingered. Deshaun Watson’s injury in Baltimore was a brutal blow, and the thought of how it completely shifted the Ravens' chances is something that still stings.  Then there was Tom Brady – he was supposed to cruise through, right?  The “GOAT” was just… not. 

It’s funny how sports, and specifically predictions, can tap into something deeper than just a game. It’s about hoping, about believing, about investing a piece of yourself into the outcome.  2020 felt like a year where everyone was clinging to those hopes with extra force, and my little predictions just amplified that feeling. 

I’m not trying to dwell on the mistakes – everyone missed some calls, every fan did. But it’s a reminder that even with all the analysis and stats, the unpredictable nature of football – and life, really – always wins out.  It’s okay to second-guess, to wonder “what if?”  Just maybe, next year, I’ll stick to enjoying the games instead of trying to predict them.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (like a particular matchup or the overall feeling of 2020)?
