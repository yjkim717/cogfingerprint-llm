"As I watched the 2020 Olympics get postponed, I found myself reminiscing about my own crafting adventures with Perler beads. I had always been fascinated by the intricate designs I could create using these tiny, colorful beads on a pegboard. One day, I wondered: what if I could scale up my designs by ironing and reassembling sections on the pegboard? Just like athletes break down complex movements into smaller parts to master them, I was trying to break down my Perler bead art into manageable chunks. While it wasn't as straightforward as perfecting a golf swing, I discovered that with patience and practice, I could create larger, more intricate bead sprites using Hama beads. The process was meditative, much like an athlete's training regimen. As the world adjusted to the new normal in 2020, I found solace in this painstaking yet rewarding craft, and it reminded me that, just like in sports, persistence and creativity can lead to remarkable outcomes."
