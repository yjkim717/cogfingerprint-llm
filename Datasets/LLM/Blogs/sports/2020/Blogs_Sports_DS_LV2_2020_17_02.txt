That day at the driving range, my new driver felt like a stranger in my hands. I was chasing distance, convinced the latest tech was the answer. But a friend’s advice stuck: “Invest in the engine, not the car.”

So, 2020 became my year of lessons. I ditched the solo video recordings and found an instructor. He didn't just fix my swing; he explained the *why*. That human connection, the immediate feedback—it transformed my game more than any club ever could. Turns out, the best equipment upgrade was the one between my ears.
