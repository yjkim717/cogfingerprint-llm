**The Shot We Didn’t See Coming**

Remember 2020? It felt like the whole world was holding its breath. I was glued to the news, watching the NBA bubble, the MLB trying to figure it out, and honestly, just feeling… unsettled. Like we were all playing a game with wildly changing rules. 

I even found myself, like a lot of folks, wondering if it was crazy to keep pouring money into things that seemed to be crumbling – watching JetBlue and MGM Resorts struggle, remembering the “stock crater” headlines. It felt like a risky investment, a gamble when everything felt uncertain. 

It’s a weird feeling, wanting to believe in something, even when the odds seem stacked against it.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the smartest play isn’t always the most obvious one – just like a last-second shot in a close game.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific sport or adding a particular element?
