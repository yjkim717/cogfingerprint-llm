Looking back at the 2019 college football season from the strange quiet of 2020, those electric Saturdays feel like a different world. I remember diving into the advanced stats—possession efficiency, opponent-adjusted metrics—trying to quantify greatness. It wasn't just about the final score, but *how* a team played. How they managed every non-garbage possession against a tough opponent.

That analytical lens makes me appreciate the artistry even more. In a year when the roar of the crowd is absent, those data-driven performances from last season stand as timeless monuments to execution under pressure. The numbers tell a story, but the feeling they evoke is pure, unscripted sport.
