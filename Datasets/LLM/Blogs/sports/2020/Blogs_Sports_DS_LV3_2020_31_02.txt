There’s something special about the weeks leading up to a new Fantasy Premier League season—that hopeful, blank-slate feeling before the grind begins. Back in the summer of 2020, with the world feeling upside down, I craved that familiar buzz more than ever. So, I decided to start a little prediction competition with my mates: guess the starting prices for ten key players.

My list was ready, with Trent Alexander-Arnold at the top. I was convinced he’d be 7.5m, a steal for the attacking returns he promised. The wait for the official price reveal was agonizing, but it made every announcement feel like an event. When TAA was finally listed at 7.5m, I celebrated like I’d won the league myself.

It wasn’t about being right; it was about sharing that collective anticipation. In a year of so much uncertainty, this small tradition reminded me why I love this game—and this community—so much.
