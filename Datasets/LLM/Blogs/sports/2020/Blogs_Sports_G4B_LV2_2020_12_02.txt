**The Quiet of That Spring**

2020. Just saying it feels… weighty, doesn’t it? I was a pretty regular runner back then, finding that rhythm – the pavement, my breath – a really grounding thing. We’d hit a local 5k every Sunday, a small, friendly competition, mostly with myself. 

Then, everything changed. The races disappeared. The usual buzz of the park faded. It was unsettling, this sudden quiet. I started running alone, further afield, just trying to recapture that feeling of pushing through, of accomplishing something tangible. 

It wasn’t about winning anymore. It was about the simple act of putting one foot in front of the other, a tiny act of defiance against the uncertainty of it all.  That spring, amidst the chaos, I realized how much we need those small, consistent routines.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic/tone?
