**The Ghosts of Ford Field**

It’s funny how certain NFL matchups just stick with you, right? I was scrolling through some stats last week, and it brought back a flood of memories – specifically, the Green Bay Packers and the Detroit Lions.  Let’s be honest, watching those two teams play always felt a little…uneasy. 

2020 was a strange year for everyone, and for the Packers, it was a reminder of a long-standing frustration. Their season series against Detroit was a consistent source of disappointment – a frustrating parade of late leads evaporated, and a losing record that just wouldn’t budge. 

It wasn’t about individual players, really, but a feeling. A sense that something just wouldn’t quite click against the Lions.  Maybe it's the history, maybe it's a psychological thing. Whatever it was, those games were a frustrating echo of what could have been.  Anyone else have a rivalry like that?
