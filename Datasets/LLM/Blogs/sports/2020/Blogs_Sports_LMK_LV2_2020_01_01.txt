"As I watched my kid navigate Fortnite's crossplay feature in 2020, I realized it's not just about gaming - it's about connection. Just like how athletes from different teams come together for a common goal, my son and I bridged our gaming platforms (Xbox and Nintendo Switch) to play together. It was a moment of unity, much like the sports world, where teamwork and camaraderie know no boundaries."
