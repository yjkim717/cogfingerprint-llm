## The Sideline Reality We Don't See

Remember watching the 2020 NBA bubble? It was surreal, wasn't it? We, the viewers, got this curated, high-definition glimpse into their world – the games, the interviews, the carefully chosen snippets of downtime. But what was it *really* like to be in Orlando, confined, playing for everything? 

It struck me then, similar to how I feel watching documentaries. We get a perspective, yes, but it’s filtered through a lens. The camera crew shapes the narrative. The players, the athletes, they're living a reality far more intense, more isolating, than anything we can truly grasp from our couches. It's a fascinating disconnect.
