**Is Mike Ever Coming Back? (And What About That Book?)**

It’s weird, right? Seeing Mike disappear for a whole sabbatical, then pop up on Twitter talking about Paris. He’s clearly been busy! I’m genuinely curious about when he’ll be back on the field – 2020 was a brutal year for everyone, and I miss his insights. Plus, he hinted at writing a book about his experiences. Seriously, what’s he working on? Any updates, Mike? #sports #sabbatical #writing
