## The Year College Hoops Felt… Different

Man, 2020. What a year, right? We all remember the chaos – the pandemic, lockdowns, the general feeling of uncertainty hanging over everything. But there's a specific pocket of time that still feels oddly distinct to me: the 2020-21 college basketball season. It was a season almost entirely defined by *different*.

I remember being cautiously optimistic as the season tipped off. After the abrupt end to March Madness the year before, there was this desperate hope for some semblance of normalcy. We needed something to root for, something to distract from the headlines. And for a while, college hoops delivered. 

The Big 12, as always, was a bloodbath. Every game felt like a potential instant classic. You knew you were in for a fight. I was particularly glued to Baylor, and watching Cade Cunningham emerge as a legitimate NBA prospect was something special. The guy was just *different* – a size and skill combination you rarely see. He carried the Bears, and for a while, it looked like they might run away with the conference.

But then, of course, things got weird again. The pandemic continued to throw curveballs. Games were postponed, schedules were shuffled, and the whole thing felt incredibly fragile. You’d be watching a game, cheering your heart out, and then hear the announcement that the next opponent had to pull out due to COVID protocols. It was stressful, to say the least.

Looking back, I'm not surprised Kansas and Texas Tech ended up sharing the Big 12 title. Both teams were consistently tough, resilient, and battled through the constant disruptions. It felt fitting, somehow, that there wasn't a clear, decisive winner in a year so defined by uncertainty. 

It wasn't a season filled with the usual March Madness magic. There wasn't the roar of the crowds, the palpable tension in the arenas. It was a season played in bubbles and empty gyms, a season that felt… muted.

But even with all the strangeness, I wouldn't trade it. It was a reminder of how sports can provide a sense of community and normalcy, even in the most chaotic of times. And it gave us a glimpse of Cade Cunningham, a player who, even in a bizarre season, shone incredibly brightly. It was a *different* kind of basketball year, and a different kind of year overall, but a memory I'll definitely hold onto.
