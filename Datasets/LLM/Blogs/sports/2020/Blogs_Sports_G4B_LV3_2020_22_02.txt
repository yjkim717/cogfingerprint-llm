**The Unexpected Game Changer**

Okay, let’s be real – 2020 was… a lot. And for me, it brought a whole new level of unpredictability to my running. I was training for a half marathon, feeling strong, finally hitting my stride, when suddenly, things started to… leak. A lot. 

Seriously, the third trimester of pregnancy hit me like a rogue wave, and my bladder became my biggest opponent. It wasn't graceful; it was a series of surprise-pees that felt incredibly embarrassing and disruptive. There were moments of genuine anxiety, wondering if I’d ever feel confident running again. 

It forced me to slow down, to listen to my body in a way I hadn’t before. It was humbling, to say the least. Looking back, those unexpected interruptions weren’t failures, but reminders that life – and a growing baby – throws curveballs.  It shifted my focus from pure speed to simply *finishing* the race, and honestly, that changed my whole approach to running.
