"Debugging My Fitness Journey: Lessons from a Challenging Year"

As I reflect on 2020, I'm reminded of the countless times I tried to 'debug' my fitness routine, only to be met with frustration. Like a Python program with a stubborn error, my progress was stuck, and I couldn't seem to pinpoint the issue. The year had brought its fair share of challenges, and my exercise regimen was no exception.

I had set out to create a schedule that would keep me on track, a function that would take into account my busy days and varying energy levels. But, just like a program with poor error handling, my routine was crashing and burning at the slightest unexpected twist. A sudden rain shower or an extra-heavy workload would throw off my entire plan.

As I looked back on my struggles, I realized that I had been approaching my fitness journey like a programmer debugging a complex code. I was focusing on the individual lines, trying to identify the exact error, rather than stepping back to assess the bigger picture. I needed to rethink my approach, just as a programmer would refactor their code to make it more robust.

By adopting a more flexible mindset and building in some 'error handling' – rest days, backup plans, and realistic expectations – I was able to get my fitness journey back on track. It's a lesson that extends far beyond my workout routine: being adaptable and resilient is key to overcoming obstacles in all areas of life. As I look to the new year, I'm excited to apply this mindset to new challenges and continue to 'debug' my path to success.
