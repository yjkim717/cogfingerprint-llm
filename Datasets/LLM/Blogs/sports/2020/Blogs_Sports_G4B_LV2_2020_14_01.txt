**The Ghosts of Big 12 Courts: Remembering a Wild 2020**

Okay, let’s be honest. 2020 was… a year. And for a lot of us, that meant a strange, almost surreal season of college basketball. I’m still wrestling with the feeling of it – a season crammed into a ridiculously short timeframe, played with a weird mix of cautious optimism and underlying anxiety. Specifically, I’ve been thinking a *lot* about the Big 12. 

I just finished revisiting the analysis of the 2020-21 season, and it hit me in a way I didn’t expect. It wasn’t just about the predictions – though, let’s be real, everyone was trying to figure out if Baylor could truly dominate, or if Iowa State’s sharpshooting would finally translate into a championship run. It was about *how* we experienced it.

Remember those bubble games? The frantic, desperate scramble to secure at-large bids? The palpable tension in every arena, amplified by the knowledge that a single loss could derail a team's entire season? It felt like a pressure cooker, and honestly, a little unsettling.

I vividly recall watching Texas Tech's improbable run, feeling a genuine sense of excitement as they defied the odds. And then there was the heartbreaking way the season ended for so many teams – the abrupt stops, the cancelled tournaments, the feeling that something vital was missing. It was a reminder that college sports, as much as we love them, are still subject to the whims of a larger world. 

Looking back, the Big 12 season of 2020 wasn't about crowning a clear-cut champion in the traditional sense. It was about resilience, adaptation, and a collective experience of uncertainty. It was a season that forced us to appreciate the simple joy of watching a good game, and to recognize the profound impact that sports – even college basketball – can have on our lives, even during the strangest of times. 

What are your memories of the 2020 college basketball season? Let me know in the comments – let’s reminisce about a truly unique year.
