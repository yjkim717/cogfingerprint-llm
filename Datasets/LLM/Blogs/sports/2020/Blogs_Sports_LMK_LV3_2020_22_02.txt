"When Pregnancy Met Marathon Training: My Unexpected Journey"

In early 2020, I was on top of the world – training for my first marathon and expecting my first child. The excitement was palpable as I navigated the demands of pregnancy alongside my rigorous training schedule. However, as I entered my third trimester, I encountered a complication that I never saw coming: urinary incontinence.

At first, I was mortified. How could this be happening to me, an otherwise healthy expectant mother? The pressure of carrying a baby coupled with the intense physical exertion of running had taken its toll on my body. Leaking urine during runs became a regular occurrence, leaving me feeling embarrassed and frustrated.

As I reflect on this challenging period, I realize that it taught me a valuable lesson about resilience and adaptability. I had to adjust my training routine, incorporating pelvic floor exercises and making strategic wardrobe choices to minimize the impact of incontinence. It wasn't easy, but I was determined to reach my goal – both of completing the marathon and becoming a mother.

This journey has shown me that pregnancy complications can arise unexpectedly, even for those who are otherwise healthy and prepared. As I look back, I appreciate the strength I discovered within myself and the support of loved ones who helped me push through. My story serves as a reminder that, sometimes, it's not about avoiding challenges, but about facing them head-on and emerging stronger on the other side.
