As a parent in 2020, I wanted to find the perfect birthday gift for my six-year-old—something to spark joy during those long indoor days. He’d been pointing at Pokémon cards, especially Gengar and Mewtwo, with wide-eyed excitement. Choosing his first real deck felt like coaching a tiny athlete: would he prefer Gengar’s tricky plays or Mewtwo’s raw power? Seeing his face light up, I realized it wasn’t just about the cards—it was about giving him a new game to love, a small victory in a challenging year.
