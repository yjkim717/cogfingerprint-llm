It’s funny how the smallest things in sports can make you pause and reflect. In 2020, amid all the chaos, the NFL quietly delivered a quirky piece of history: five teams scored exactly five points in a single quarter. That hadn’t happened in the regular season since 1949. It’s a scoring anomaly, a weird little blip in the record books. It reminds me that even in a game driven by explosive plays and superstars, there’s still room for the odd, the rare, and the wonderfully unpredictable.
