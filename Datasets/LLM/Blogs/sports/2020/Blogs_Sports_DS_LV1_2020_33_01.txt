Looking back on the 2020 season, the Packers-Lions rivalry was a strange beast. On paper, it was a dead-even split. But the story told on the field was different.

For all the back-and-forth, we held our breath for most of those games. The Packers, despite the even record, seemed to be playing from behind an invisible wall. It’s a bizarre feeling—knowing your team can win, yet seeing the clock perpetually working against them. That season series was a lesson in how thin the line is in this league. A play here, a bounce there, and that 4-4 record could have told a completely different, dominant story. It was a rivalry defined not by the final scores, but by the tense, fleeting nature of our leads.
