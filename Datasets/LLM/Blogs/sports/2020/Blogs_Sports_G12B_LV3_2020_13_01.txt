## That Feeling When the Underdog Wins… and Makes You Question Everything

Okay, so I’m still buzzing from last night’s game. The Raptors absolutely *crushed* the Celtics. I mean, nobody, and I mean *nobody*, expected that kind of performance. Everyone was talking about Boston’s resurgence, about Tatum and Brown finally clicking, about how Toronto was… well, let’s just say not looking their best.

And then *this* happened.

It reminded me of something I read recently about a woman on Reddit who got a bizarre voicemail about her phone number being listed as an alternate on someone’s Verizon account. It was so strange, so unexpected, and it made her question everything – her security, her identity. Last night’s game felt a little like that. A complete disruption of the expected narrative. 

You build up these assumptions, right? You see the rankings, you hear the analysts, you form your own little picture in your head. And then the underdog comes along and just… shatters it.

It’s exhilarating, of course. That pure, unadulterated joy of seeing the unexpected unfold. But it’s also a little unsettling. It throws your carefully constructed understanding of the world, even a tiny world like basketball, into a tailspin. 

2020 has been a year of unexpected twists and turns, hasn't it? Maybe this game was just a small reflection of that bigger, more chaotic reality. Maybe embracing the uncertainty, the possibility of the unexpected, is the only way to truly appreciate the ride.
