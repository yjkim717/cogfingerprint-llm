The 2020 college football season was shaping up to be an exciting one, and the rankings were a great indicator of the top contenders. As I looked at the Week /r/CFB Poll, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The Alabama Crimson Tide, Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and Ohio State Buckeyes were dominating the top spots, and it was clear that these teams were giving it their all.

As a fan, it's thrilling to watch these talented teams battle it out on the field. The Crimson Tide's powerhouse offense, led by their star quarterback, was nearly unstoppable. Meanwhile, Notre Dame's Fighting Irish were proving that they were a force to be reckoned with, thanks to their stingy defense and clever coaching. And then there were the Buckeyes, Ohio State's mighty team that was making a strong case for themselves with their impressive wins.

As I watched these teams duke it out, I couldn't help but reflect on what makes college football so special. It's not just about the wins or the losses; it's about the camaraderie, the teamwork, and the dedication that these athletes bring to the field every week. In a year like 2020, when the world was feeling uncertain and divided, the college football rankings brought us together, giving us something to rally behind and cheer for.

As I looked at the rankings, I felt a sense of pride and excitement for the teams that were leading the pack. The 2020 season was one for the books, and it's memories like these that make being a college football fan so rewarding.
