>## The Unexpected Gift of a Second Chance

Remember back in 2010? I was obsessed with local soccer. I’d poured everything into training, convinced I was destined for a scholarship. Tryouts were brutal, and I didn't make the varsity team. Crushed, I almost quit. My dad, seeing my disappointment, bought me a “second chance” – a spot on the JV squad. 

Looking back in 2020, I realize that JV wasn’t a consolation prize. It was where I truly learned teamwork, grit, and how to bounce back. Sometimes, what feels like a setback, like failing to reach an initial goal, can be a surprisingly valuable opportunity. It’s about making the most of what you *do* have, not dwelling on what you thought you *should* have.
