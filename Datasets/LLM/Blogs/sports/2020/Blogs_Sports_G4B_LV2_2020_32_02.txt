**The Weirdness of College Football Schedules in 2020**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2020 was *weird*. And college football scheduling wasn’t exactly immune to the chaos. I was watching a bunch of ACC games, and it felt like they were trying to reinvent the wheel with these new “acc scheduling” rules. 

Suddenly, you’d see a powerhouse like Clemson playing a team they barely knew – a “non-conference game” that felt more like a random draw. It got me thinking about the whole landscape of college football, especially the G5 programs. Are these new rules really helping them gain exposure, or are they just creating more unpredictable, and frankly, less exciting, schedules? 

It’s a tricky balance, right? Conferences want to protect their own, but also recognize the rising talent in these smaller programs.  I just wish they’d focused on making the games *better* instead of just rearranging the deck chairs. What did you guys think of the 2020 scheduling shake-up? Let me know in the comments!

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way – perhaps add a specific example of a strange matchup or adjust the tone further?
