## The Chill of Disappointment and the Heat of Trying Again

2020… what a year, right? It wasn’t just the pandemic that felt like a constant temperature shift. Remember the Cardinals' season? We started hot, full of promise, felt like we could really contend. Then… nothing. Just a slow, steady slide into mediocrity. 

It got me thinking about persistence, about pushing against the odds. Like trying to maintain a consistent temperature – whether it's with a fancy water-cooled system or sheer grit – it's tough. We invest so much energy, build up expectations, and then things just…don’t work as planned.  Maybe it’s a faulty element, a leak in the system, or maybe just an unexpected shift in the environment.  It’s a frustrating feeling, but it also reminds you that trying, learning, and adjusting is the whole point. We'll be back, Cardinals. And we'll be ready.
