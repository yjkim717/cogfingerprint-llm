## The Year Everything Felt…Upside Down, and My Bracket's Tears

2020. Just saying the year feels like a punch to the gut, doesn't it? A year of masks, Zoom calls, and a weird, persistent feeling that the ground was shifting beneath our feet. And college football? It was *something* else entirely.

I’m a die-hard college football fan. I live for Saturdays in the fall, the smell of tailgate food, the roar of the crowd (remember crowds?!). But 2020… 2020 was a season played in bubbles, with limited fans, and a constant, underlying anxiety about whether the next game would even *happen*.

I, like many others, meticulously crafted my preseason poll. I’d spent hours pouring over returning starters, analyzing recruiting rankings, and generally convincing myself I knew what was going to happen in the world of college football. Alabama, naturally, was at the top. They always are, aren’t they? Then Notre Dame, looking strong with a revamped offense, and Ohio State, well, Ohio State is *always* a contender. Classic. Textbook. 

I remember the smug satisfaction I felt at presenting my bracket to my buddies. We debated, we argued, we declared ourselves experts. It felt…normal, for a little while. A small pocket of predictability in a world that had gone completely haywire.

Then the season started, and things got…strange.

There were upsets left and right. Games were postponed, then rescheduled. Teams were battling COVID outbreaks just to field a squad. It felt like every week brought a new twist, a new curveball. And my bracket? My beautiful, carefully constructed bracket? It started to crumble. Slowly at first, then with a dramatic, heartbreaking collapse.

The r/CFB poll, that online hive mind of college football fanatics, reflected the chaos. It shifted constantly. Alabama held on, stubbornly refusing to relinquish the top spot, but Notre Dame and Ohio State danced around each other, swapping positions with unsettling regularity.  It wasn't the clean, predictable hierarchy I’d envisioned. It was a swirling mass of possibility and disappointment.

Looking back, though, I realize that's what made the 2020 season so memorable. It wasn’t about the rankings, really. It was about the resilience of the players, the coaches, and the fans who clung to the game as a source of comfort and connection in a time of profound uncertainty.

It was about the sheer absurdity of watching a game with a mask on, hoping everyone involved was staying healthy. It was about celebrating small victories and accepting that, sometimes, things just don't go as planned.

My bracket was a disaster. But honestly? I wouldn't trade that chaotic, unpredictable 2020 college football season for anything. It was a weird, wild ride, and it reminded me that even in the midst of the unexpected, there's still something powerful and unifying about the love of the game
