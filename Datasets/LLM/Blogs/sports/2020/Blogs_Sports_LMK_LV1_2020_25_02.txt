As I stepped onto the soccer field in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but think of Calvin's misadventures with scary birds. "Don't let the fear get the best of you," I told myself, recalling a quote I'd heard somewhere. It wasn't until later that I realized it was from a childhood cartoon. Facing my fears head-on, I played the best game of my life. Sometimes, it's the smallest motivators that make the biggest difference.
