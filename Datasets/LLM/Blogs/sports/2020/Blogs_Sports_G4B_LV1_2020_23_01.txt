**The View From the Couch (and the Jungle)**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching *Survivor* last year felt… intense. Like I was right there, glued to the camera, feeling every challenge, every social shift. I spent hours analyzing the players, crafting my own strategies.  It made me think about my own life – how much of it do I *observe*, versus actually *doing*?  Maybe 2020 was a good year to ask that question.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post on a different sport or with a slightly altered focus?
