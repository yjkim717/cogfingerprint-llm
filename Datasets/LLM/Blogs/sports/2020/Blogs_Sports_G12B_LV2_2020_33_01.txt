>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational, and relatable tone, set in 2020.  I've focused on the surprising lead time element and tied it into a broader feeling about the Packers/Lions rivalry.  I've included a suggested title and a couple of potential image ideas at the end.

## The Weirdly Quick History of Packers-Lions Games (and What It Says About Rivalries)

Remember 2020? A year that felt like it stretched on forever, yet somehow vanished in a blink? It got me thinking about things, even football. Specifically, the Packers and the Lions. We're rivals, right? Generations of bad blood, Thanksgiving battles, the whole nine yards. You'd expect a long, drawn-out history of dramatic shifts in dominance.

But I stumbled across something fascinating. Apparently, over the last four years (leading up to 2020), the total *lead time* in Packers-Lions games has been surprisingly small. Like, shockingly small. It really made me pause.

It’s a little counterintuitive, isn't it? Rivalries *feel* like they build slowly, with gradual changes accumulating over time. This data suggests something else – that sometimes, the most intense rivalries are defined by a handful of nail-biters, of games decided in the final minutes, rather than consistent, sweeping victories. Maybe that’s what makes them so memorable. Maybe it’s the close calls that truly define a rivalry.

**Possible Image Ideas:**

*   A split image: One side showing a classic, old-school Packers-Lions photo (maybe a snowy Thanksgiving game), the other a more modern action shot.
*   A graphic visualizing the "lead time" data, presented in a simple, easy-to-understand way.



Let me know if you’d like me to adjust the tone, add more detail, or explore a different angle!
