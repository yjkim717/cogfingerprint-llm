### The Day I Got Benched from the Internet

It was the spring of 2020, and my world had shrunk to the size of my living room. With gyms shuttered, my fitness journey moved entirely online. Like many, I found a digital home on Reddit, specifically the r/fitness subreddit. It was my daily dose of motivation and information.

One afternoon, I saw a post from a clearly frustrated beginner. They were confused about creating a calorie deficit, a foundational concept, but their post was removed by a moderator for being “easily searchable.” I understood the need for order, but the removal reason felt dismissive. So, I commented, suggesting that maybe we could be more welcoming to those just starting out.

That’s when it happened. A moderator didn’t just engage with my point; they descended with the fury of an Olympic-level powerlifter spotting a five-pound weight. My comment was deleted, and I was hit with a direct message calling my perspective “unproductive” and “antagonistic.” I tried to reply, to explain that I wasn’t trying to cause trouble, but my messages were ignored. A few hours later, the final hammer fell: a permanent ban from the community.

Staring at the screen, I felt a strange mix of anger and absurdity. Here I was, isolated in a global pandemic, and I’d just been exiled from my digital squat rack. It was a stark lesson. The pursuit of physical betterment, even in a virtual space, can sometimes be overshadowed by the very human flaws of ego and inflexibility. That ban, ironically, pushed me off the forum and back into my own head—and my own home workouts. I realized the most important moderator I’d ever need was the one in the mirror, pushing me to be better, not just right.
