## The Sudden Stop: Remembering College Basketball's Clock Change

It's 2020, and I was watching a classic college basketball game the other day – grainy footage, but the energy was electric. Something felt…different. Then it hit me. It used to be *so* frustrating watching a team down by one, desperately needing a timeout after a basket, only to have the clock keep running! 

I vaguely remember those nail-biting moments from the 70s and 80s. When did they change the rule to stop the clock after a made basket? It feels like a lifetime ago, and a small but significant shift in the rhythm of the game. Anyone else remember those frantic final seconds before the change?
