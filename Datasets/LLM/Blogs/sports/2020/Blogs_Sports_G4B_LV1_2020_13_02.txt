**Thinking Big (and Maybe Shipping Shirts to Canada?)**

It’s been a weird year, hasn’t it? 2020 threw everything at us. But amidst the lockdowns and masks, I’ve been tinkering with a small idea – designing some killer university apparel and, dare I say it, exploring shipping it to Canada! 

Specifically, I’m wrestling with the logistics of sales tax and those pesky international duties. It feels a little daunting, honestly.  I’ve been scouring online forums and trying to figure out how this would actually work. 

It’s a totally low-stakes project, just a little side hustle to explore. But the thought of seeing my designs on students across the border… well, it’s a surprisingly motivating thing.  Anyone have any tips for navigating the sales tax maze for international shirt shops? Let me know in the comments!
