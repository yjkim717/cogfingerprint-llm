## The Quiet of the Empty Stadium

Remember the weirdness of 2020? Everything felt…off. For me, a huge part of that was the silence surrounding sports. I’m a lifelong baseball fan, and suddenly, there were no roaring crowds, no crack of the bat echoing through a packed stadium. Just…empty seats.

It was unsettling, sure, but also strangely peaceful. I found myself appreciating the *game* itself more, the strategy, the individual skill. It made me realize how much of the experience I usually took for granted, lost in the collective energy. Now, with fans back, it’s amazing, but a little part of me misses that quiet contemplation. A reminder that sometimes, less is more.
