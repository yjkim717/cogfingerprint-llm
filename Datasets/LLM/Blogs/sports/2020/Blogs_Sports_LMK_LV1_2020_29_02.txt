"As I geared up for the 2020 simracing season, disaster struck - Thrustmaster announced a supply shortage for T300RS GT servo motors! I was devastated. After months of searching, I finally found a replacement. The thrill of getting back on track was exhilarating. The hunt was worth it - my racing line was tighter than ever. Has anyone else faced a similar challenge?"
