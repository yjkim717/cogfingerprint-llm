>## The Unexpected Pivot: Lessons from Fundraising and the 2020 Season

This year has been… a lot, hasn’t it? As a fundraising professional in higher education, I've been navigating a landscape of uncertainty alongside everyone else. We’ve been wrestling with the implications of the CARES Act and its impact on charitable giving – specifically, trying to decipher what exactly constitutes an “individual” for those generous tax deductions. A recent report from the Joint Committee on Taxation has added another layer of complexity!

It’s made me think about the sports world, too. Remember the abrupt halt to seasons? The scrambling to reschedule, the innovative bubble environments? Teams and athletes had to pivot *fast*. Just like we’re adapting our fundraising strategies, they learned to find new ways to connect with fans and compete.

It’s a reminder that resilience, adaptability, and clarity in communication are vital, no matter your field. Whether it’s explaining tax law or rallying a team, navigating the unexpected requires a willingness to learn, adjust, and keep moving forward. And honestly, a little bit of grace for everyone involved.
