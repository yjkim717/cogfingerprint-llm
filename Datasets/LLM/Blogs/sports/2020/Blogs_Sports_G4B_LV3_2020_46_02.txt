Remember 2020? It felt… strange, didn’t it? Beyond the obvious, I was struck by some bizarre moments in football. I kept seeing reports about the Vikings scoring a five-point quarter – a statistic so old it hadn’t been seen since 1949! It really made me think about how much the game has changed, how the rules and strategies have evolved. 

It’s a reminder that even in something as seemingly constant as sports, there’s always room for the unexpected, for echoes of the past to ripple through the present.  A single quarter, a single score – it’s a tiny snapshot of a season, and a fascinating glimpse into football’s history.
