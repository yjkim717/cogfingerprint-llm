**The Year the Rankings Felt…Off**

Remember 2020? It felt like a year of constant shifts, didn’t it? And that extended even into the world of MMA rankings. I was glued to the updates, obsessing over the lists – the Diaz brothers, the inactivity debates, the ripple effects of cancelled fights. 

It wasn’t just about who was ‘number one’; it was about the *why*.  A lot of the rankings felt…fuzzy.  There were fighters disappearing for months, weight class boundaries blurring, and a general sense of things being delayed. It struck me how much the rankings reflect more than just a fighter's current performance. 

It made me think about how we value consistency, and what happens when someone steps away. Do we erase them completely?  I started wondering about a better system – a way to acknowledge a fighter’s history while still assessing their current potential.  Maybe 2020 was a year of realizing that ranking isn’t just a number; it's a conversation about loyalty, time, and the unpredictable nature of sport.
