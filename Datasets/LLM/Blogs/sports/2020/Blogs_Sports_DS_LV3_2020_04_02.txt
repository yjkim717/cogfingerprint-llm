It’s 2020, and I keep thinking about Bill Simmons and SVP. Both are giants in sports media, both deep into the gambling talk that’s taken over podcasts. They’ve got Ryen Russilo as this perfect connective thread. So why haven’t they teamed up? It feels like a natural fit, a collaboration just waiting to happen. In a year craving fresh content, this potential duo remains one of sports media’s great “what ifs.” Sometimes the most obvious connections are the ones we never make.
