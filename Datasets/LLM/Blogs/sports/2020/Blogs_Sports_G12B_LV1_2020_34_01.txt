Okay, here's a blog post inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational tone and storytelling style, set in 2020. I've tried to weave in some of the concepts (game ratings, efficiency, rankings) without getting overly technical, and aimed for roughly 700 words.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: The Echo of 2019: Why I'm Still Thinking About That College Football Season**

Okay, let’s be honest. 2020 has been... a lot. A *lot* a lot. We've all got a million things vying for our attention, a constant stream of news and anxieties. Sometimes, you just want to rewind, to find a little pocket of normalcy, a memory of a simpler time. For me, lately, that’s been drifting back to the 2019 college football season.

I know, I know. It was over a year ago. Seems like a lifetime ago now. But something about that season, and the way it unfolded, has really stuck with me. And it’s not just because Alabama ultimately won – though, let's be real, they usually do. It’s something deeper than that.

It started with a weird feeling, a sense that things were shifting. We were coming off a 2018 season that felt *dominated* by Alabama.  They were the undisputed kings, and while there were good teams, it felt like everyone was just playing for second place. But 2019?  2019 felt different. It felt…competitive.

I remember stumbling across this fascinating deep dive online – someone had put together a really detailed analysis of the season using a system they called “Feis’ Top 100 Game Ratings.” I’m not going to pretend I understood all the formulas, but the core idea was brilliant. It wasn’t just about wins and losses. It was about *how* teams won, about efficiency, about how they performed against the strength of their schedule. They even had something called "adjusted game efficiency," which, as far as I could tell, accounted for the quality of the opponent. It was infinitely more nuanced than just looking at the AP poll.

And that’s what hooked me.  Because when you start looking at things through that lens, the whole season takes on a new shape. You realize that a lot of the narratives we were being fed – the easy pronouncements about who was “good” or “bad” – were often oversimplified.

Take Oklahoma, for example. They had a really strong year, and they were consistently ranked high. But looking at these ratings, you started to see a more complex picture. Their offense was, as always, explosive. But their defense? Well, it wasn’t always holding up its end of the bargain. The ratings showed how they sometimes struggled to maintain possession, how crucial those few key offensive plays were to masking those defensive vulnerabilities. You understood *why* they could beat some teams convincingly, and *why* they sometimes stumbled against tougher opponents.

Then there was the constant debate about LSU. Joe Burrow's performance was legendary, obviously. Everyone was talking about it. But the ratings highlighted something else – how
