The MMA rankings - a hot topic among fans and a necessary evil in the world of mixed martial arts. As we navigated 2020, I couldn't help but think about the fighters who have been absent from the octagon for far too long. It's not uncommon to see names at the top of the rankings, yet they've been inactive for over a year. Take, for instance, the likes of Anderson Silva and Anderson's contemporary, Vitor Belfort, who both last stepped into the cage in 2019. Their inactivity raises a valid question: should they still be ranked among the best?

The UFC rankings are meant to reflect a fighter's current skill level and performance. However, when a fighter goes dark for an extended period, their ranking becomes a relic of past glories rather than a reflection of their current abilities. It's like giving a participation trophy to someone who's not even showing up to the game anymore. The rankings should be a true representation of the current landscape, not a nostalgic nod to a fighter's heyday.

Moreover, this inactivity not only skews the rankings but also denies opportunities to newer, hungry fighters who are actively competing and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in MMA. As fans, we deserve to see the best match-ups, and that can't happen when inactive fighters occupy top spots. So, it's time for the UFC to take a hard look at the rankings and consider giving opportunities to the fighters who are ready, willing, and able to put on a show. By doing so, they'll keep the sport fresh, exciting, and true to its competitive spirit.
