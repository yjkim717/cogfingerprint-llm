**The Ghosts of Rewatchables Past**

It’s weird how certain things stick with you, right? Like that one ridiculously long drive with your family, or a song that instantly transports you back to a specific summer. For me, it’s the *Bill Simmons Rewatchables*. 

I remember devouring those back in 2010, a young, obsessed sports fan just trying to understand the magic of the NBA.  Then, life happened.  I heard a Reddit user was offering to share a massive archive of almost 110 of those episodes – a digital time capsule – and honestly, it felt… nostalgic. 

It made me think about how much things change, and how some corners of the internet hold onto these weird, wonderful pockets of shared obsession.  Maybe it’s time for a rewatch.  Anyone else feeling that urge to revisit the early days of sports podcasting?
