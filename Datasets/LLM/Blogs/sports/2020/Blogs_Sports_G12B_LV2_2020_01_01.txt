## The Quiet of the Empty Stands

Remember the roar? 2020 feltâ€¦ muted. I used to love the electric energy of a local basketball game, the collective gasp of the crowd. Suddenly, silence. Watching games on TV just wasn't the same. It highlighted how much we crave shared experience, that human connection woven into the fabric of sport. Hopefully, we're getting back to that feeling, one cheering fan at a time.
