It felt…weird, didn’t it? 2020 was a year of the unexpected, and college football was no exception. I was glued to the screen watching the SEC and ACC scramble to fill their schedules. The stories of SEC teams reaching out for non-conference games – filling gaps where rivalries couldn’t quite fit – really highlighted the sheer scheduling challenges these conferences faced. It made you think about how much we *expect* from the sport, and how much work goes on behind the scenes to deliver it.  A little bit of chaos, a lot of problem-solving – that’s college football in 2020, for sure.
