The year 2020 forced us all to improvise. My garage became my gym, and that old stereo system—complete with its finicky binding posts—my only workout companion. I’d hastily wrap speaker cables around the posts instead of securing them properly, telling myself the connection was “good enough.”

During a particularly intense set, the music would cut out—a brief, silent reminder of my corner-cutting. Then one day, silence stayed. A blown fuse.

Staring at that tiny, broken component, it hit me. This wasn’t just about a stereo. It was about discipline. In sports and in life, a weak connection—to our training, our focus, our fundamentals—might hold for a while. But under real pressure, it fails. That silent garage taught me a crucial 2020 lesson: true strength is built on doing things the right way, not just the easy way.
