I still remember my first marathon in 2020 - it was a surreal experience. As I hit the road, I couldn't help but think of all the early morning training sessions and sacrifices I made to get to that starting line. The COVID-19 pandemic had turned everything upside down, and many were worried that the event would be cancelled. But it went ahead, albeit with strict safety measures in place. As I ran, I felt a deep sense of accomplishment and pride. The experience taught me that with determination and perseverance, I could push through even the toughest challenges. Reflecting on that day, I'm reminded that sometimes it's the obstacles that make the journey worthwhile. The sense of community and camaraderie with fellow runners was palpable, making it a truly unforgettable experience.
