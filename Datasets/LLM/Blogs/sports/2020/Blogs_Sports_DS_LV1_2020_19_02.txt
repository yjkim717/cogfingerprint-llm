### The Ground Beneath My Feet

It’s 2020, and my world has shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. My usual five-mile runs were the first thing to go, replaced by a restless pacing from the living room to the kitchen. I felt disconnected, from people, from routine, and strangely, from the ground.

That’s when I stumbled on an online AMA with Mountain Evan Chang, the founder of Carets. He spoke about designing barefoot dress shoes, but what really stuck with me was his philosophy: that we’ve lost touch with the sensory feedback of the earth. He wasn't just selling minimalist shoes; he was advocating for a more mindful way to move.

Inspired, I kicked off my cushioned running shoes and started walking barefoot in my backyard. At first, it was awkward. I felt every pebble, every blade of grass. But soon, that sensitivity became a meditation. It forced me to be present, to pay attention to each step. My short, shoeless walks became the most grounded part of my day—a small, quiet rebellion against the chaos, reminding me that sometimes, the simplest connection is the one right beneath your feet.
