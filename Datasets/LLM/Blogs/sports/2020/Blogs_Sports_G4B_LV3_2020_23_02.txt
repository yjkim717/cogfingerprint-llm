**Why I Still Root for the “Real” Guys (and Gals)**

Okay, 2020 was… a lot, right? We were all craving authentic connection, and honestly, watching *Survivor* felt like a much-needed antidote to the influencer-driven world taking over everything. I was so relieved to see the casting choices this season – it’s a refreshing change to see people genuinely chosen for their personalities and resilience, not for a pre-packaged social media following.

I remember watching Erik Reichenbach’s early moves this season and thinking, “This guy’s just being himself!”  It’s a reminder that fans are craving genuine connection, and the show is delivering.  Let’s hope this trend continues!
