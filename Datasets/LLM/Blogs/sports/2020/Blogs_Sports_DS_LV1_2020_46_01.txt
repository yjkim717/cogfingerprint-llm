**Title: Taming the Mega-Bead Project: A Sectional Ironing Guide**

So, you've got an epic Perler bead design in mind—a sprawling multi-board mural of your favorite video game character or a massive, rainbow-colored logo. Your ambition is huge, but your pegboard is standard-sized. How do you conquer this creative Everest without the beads going everywhere?

The secret technique used by seasoned bead artists is **sectional ironing**. The process is straightforward: you carefully build and iron your design in manageable, pegboard-sized sections. The key is to only partially melt the beads in each section—you want them fused enough to hold their shape but still have open holes on the back. Once you have all your sections ready, you place them back onto the pegboard, aligning the pattern perfectly. Then, with a fresh sheet of ironing paper, you give the entire project a final, gentle ironing. This last pass melts the seams between the sections, weaving them together into one single, sturdy, and incredibly impressive masterpiece. No more fear of the big idea!

### The Unlikely Coach of 2020

It’s funny the things that end up saving you. For me, in the strange standstill of 2020, it wasn't a person but a simple, solitary run.

My soccer cleats had gathered dust in the garage for months. The season was cancelled, the fields were empty, and the collective energy of my team was just… gone. I felt untethered, my purpose tied to a game I could no longer play. One restless afternoon, I laced up my running shoes out of sheer boredom.

There was no playbook, no coach’s whistle, no goal to score. Just my breath, the rhythm of my feet on the pavement, and my own thoughts. At first, it was a struggle. But with each run, something shifted. I wasn't running from anything or toward a trophy. I was just moving, proving to myself that I still could.

That lonely pavement taught me more about discipline and inner drive than any packed stadium ever had. In a year we lost so much, I found a different kind of sport—one played entirely for myself.
