**The Weight of a Poll: Remembering 2020 College Football**

2020… just the year itself feels like a hazy memory now, doesn’t it? But I was scrolling through Reddit the other day, stumbling across a college football poll – and it hit me with a strange wave of nostalgia.

There were whispers of Notre Dame’s resurgence, and a few teams I hadn’t even paid much attention to suddenly popping up in the conversation. It made me think about how these polls, these little snapshots of opinion, actually capture the *feeling* of a season. They’re not about definitive truth, but about the collective excitement, the hopes, and the anxieties we all shared as college football fans in 2020.  It was a year for the history books, and even a Reddit poll could remind you of that.
