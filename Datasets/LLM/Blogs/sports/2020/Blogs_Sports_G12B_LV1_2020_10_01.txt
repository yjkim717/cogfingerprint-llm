## The Empty Stands and the Quiet Inside

Remember the roar of the crowd? 2020 felt so strange without it. As a lifelong sports fan, watching games unfold in empty stadiums wasâ€¦ unsettling. It wasn't just the lack of atmosphere; it felt like a piece of what connected us all was missing. Like so many others, I found myself wrestling with a quiet loneliness, a feeling amplified by the absence of those shared, joyful experiences. It made me appreciate the power of sport, and the importance of connection, more than ever.
