## The Unexpected Pivot: My Baseball Season and Learning to Adapt

Remember 2020? Everything felt…shifted. For me, it meant watching my local minor league baseball team, the Mudhens, cancel their season. A huge disappointment, sure, but it also forced me to look at things differently. I’d been a die-hard fan for years, always focused on the next game, the next player. 

Suddenly, there *was* no next game. 

It was a strange lesson in adaptability. I started digging deeper – reading about the team’s history, volunteering with a local baseball charity. I realized there were so many other ways to connect with the sport I loved, ways I hadn't even considered before. 

Sometimes, the biggest setbacks lead to unexpected opportunities. It’s about finding the new game, even when the old one is gone. What unexpected pivots have *you* experienced this year?
