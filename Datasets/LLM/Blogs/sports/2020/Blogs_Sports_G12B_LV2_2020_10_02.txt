## The Empty Court and Finding My Game Again

Remember those early days of 2020? The world just…stopped. Suddenly, my weekly basketball games, the ones I’d looked forward to all week, vanished. The local courts were deserted, and the usual buzz of friendly competition was replaced with an eerie silence. It felt like a huge chunk of my routine, and honestly, a big part of my social life, had disappeared.

I missed the feeling of the ball in my hands, the camaraderie with my teammates, even the post-game exhaustion. It was more than just a game; it was a release, a connection. For a while, I felt a little lost.

Then, I started shooting hoops in my driveway, just me and the basket. It wasn’t the same, but it was *something*. It reminded me that even when the bigger game is paused, you can still find ways to play.  It taught me to appreciate the small moments, the simple joy of movement, and the resilience of a passion that can adapt, even when the court is empty.
