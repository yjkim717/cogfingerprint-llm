>## The Unexpected Lesson from My Old Dog's Stairs

It’s 2020, and life feels like navigating an obstacle course sometimes, doesn’t it? Lately, I've been wrestling with how to help my big, goofy dog, Buster, manage our stairs. He’s 8, a hefty 120lbs, and facing potential paw surgery – a real blow for a dog who loves to bound around. 

Watching him struggle, so proud and strong yet suddenly needing a little help, has been surprisingly poignant. It’s a reminder that even the most capable among us need support sometimes. It's taught me a valuable lesson about grace, acceptance, and the quiet strength in asking for what you need. Just like a sidelined athlete, Buster's adapting, and so am I.
