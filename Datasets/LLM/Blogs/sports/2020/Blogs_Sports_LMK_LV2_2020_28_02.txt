I still remember watching the 2020 NBA Bubble, feeling a mix of emotions as the world around me seemed to be on pause. For me, sports have always been more than just a game - they're about community, perseverance, and growth. Just like a nonprofit professional seeking to boost their career through planned giving certifications, athletes continually develop their skills to make a greater impact on their team. As I watched the players adapt to the bubble, I realized that professional development is a journey, not a destination. Whether on or off the court, it's the dedication to growth that truly matters.
