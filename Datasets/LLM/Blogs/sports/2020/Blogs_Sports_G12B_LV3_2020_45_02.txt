## When Even Legends Have Quiet Quarters

Okay, sports fans, did you see this? It's 2020, and we're still finding moments that stop us in our tracks. I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day about Kawhi Leonard and LeBron James *both* having zero-point fourth quarters. Seriously! It's a reminder that even the absolute greats have off nights. It's humbling, really, and a good nudge to appreciate the grind â€“ even for the legends.
