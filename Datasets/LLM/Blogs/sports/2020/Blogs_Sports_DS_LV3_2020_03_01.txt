The air in Ford Field felt different that Sunday in 2020—quieter, with echoes where roars should have been. As a lifelong Lions fan, I’ve learned to brace for the emotional rollercoaster, but this was something else. Both teams were battered, key players sidelined with injuries that felt like a metaphor for the year itself.

Yet, there was a strange comfort in tuning into the broadcast from my living room, the familiar voices narrating the struggle on the field. Watching the Saints and Lions push through felt like a shared act of resilience. In a season shadowed by uncertainty, gameday became a reminder that even when we’re not at our strongest, we can still show up and fight. And sometimes, that’s enough.
