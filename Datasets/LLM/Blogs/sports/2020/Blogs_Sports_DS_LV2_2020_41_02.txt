It’s March 2020, and the world feels upside down. The NCAA tournament is canceled—something I never thought I’d see in my lifetime. In the quiet that followed, I found myself diving into the AP Poll voter data, those weekly ballots that shape so much of the conversation in college basketball.

At first, it was just numbers and charts—tracking which voters consistently echoed the consensus and which were the outliers, stubbornly sticking to their convictions. But then it hit me: those outlier voters are a lot like us, aren’t they? In a year when so much feels uncertain, there’s something quietly brave about holding your ground, even when the crowd sways another way.

I thought about my own life—the pressure to conform, to nod along even when my gut said otherwise. Maybe those voters, with their unexpected picks and defiant rankings, were onto something. They reminded me that consistency isn’t just about falling in line; sometimes, it’s about staying true to what you believe, even if you stand alone.

In a season cut short, their ballots became a kind of poetry—a testament to the messy, beautiful humanity in sports. And honestly, I think we could all use a little more of that right now.
