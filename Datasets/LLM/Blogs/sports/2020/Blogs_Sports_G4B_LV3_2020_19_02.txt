**The Year We Started Listening to Our Feet**

2020 was… a lot, wasn’t it? Between lockdowns and a general sense of uncertainty, I found myself craving a connection to something real, something grounded. And that’s how I stumbled upon Carets and Mountain Evan Chang. 

I’d always been a shoe person – cushioned, supportive, the whole nine yards. But reading about Carets’ philosophy of barefoot running, of letting your feet do the work, really resonated. It felt like a tiny act of rebellion against the relentless pace of the year. 

Then I saw the Reddit AMA scheduled with Evan himself. Honestly, I was excited just to hear about the *process* – how he blends his athletic background with this radically different approach to footwear. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best way forward isn’t about the newest gadget, but about rediscovering what our bodies already know.  It’s about listening to our feet, and trusting them to guide us.
