**The Long Shot and the Slow Build**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a season of long shots for a lot of us. Remember those early days of lockdown? Everything felt uncertain, like a team constantly changing its strategy mid-game. I found myself thinking a lot about my own “score” – not on a field, but with my finances. 

I’d let my credit card usage slip a bit, and my credit score was definitely taking a hit. It felt demoralizing, like a team consistently missing key passes. But then I started focusing on small, consistent improvements – paying down balances, avoiding new charges, really tracking my *credit utilization*. 

It’s been a slow, steady build, a little like a marathon runner finding their pace.  There were definitely frustrating setbacks, moments where I wanted to throw in the towel. But just like a team that keeps working together, I kept chipping away.  And honestly? Seeing that credit score slowly climb back up felt…amazing. It’s a reminder that even the longest shots can pay off with patience and persistence.
