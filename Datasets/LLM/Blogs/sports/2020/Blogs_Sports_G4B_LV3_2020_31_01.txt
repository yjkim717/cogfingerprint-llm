**The Unfinished Season**

It’s strange, isn’t it? How something so seemingly simple – a single, well-worn basketball – can feel like a huge, disruptive force in your life. That's exactly what happened to me this spring. I was part of a local semi-pro league, really enjoying the camaraderie and the challenge of pushing myself. 2020 was already a weird year, and the team was building something special.

Then, just as we were starting to gel, our point guard, Liam, tore his ACL. It wasn’t a dramatic injury, no highlight reel worthy, but it was a devastating blow. And then, the kicker – a vital part of his jersey, a small, almost insignificant patch with our team logo, was unavailable. 

It sounds silly, I know, but it triggered this wave of frustration. It wasn't just about the jersey; it was about the feeling of being incomplete, the uncertainty of the season, the financial strain of replacing it when we were already tight. It mirrored that feeling of the whole year – a season abruptly halted, leaving us with an unsettling void. 

Like Liam’s injury, sometimes the smallest things can expose a larger sense of disruption. It made me realize how much we rely on those small, familiar comforts – the team uniform, the routine – to give us a sense of stability and belonging.  It was a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there's a quiet resilience to be found.
