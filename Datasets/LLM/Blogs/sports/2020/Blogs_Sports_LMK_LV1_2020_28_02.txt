As I laced up my running shoes for a pre-dawn jog in early 2020, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between training for a marathon and building a robust fundraising program for my nonprofit. Just as a runner needs to pace themselves and focus on long-term goals, a nonprofit professional must balance annual giving campaigns with planned giving strategies. With the pandemic forcing many of us to re-evaluate our priorities, I realized I needed to level up my skills in planned giving. I'm on the hunt for top-notch certifications and resources to help me get there. Have you come across any game-changers in the world of planned giving? I'm all ears! As I pound the pavement, I'm reminded that professional development is a marathon, not a sprint â€“ and I'm ready to put in the work.
