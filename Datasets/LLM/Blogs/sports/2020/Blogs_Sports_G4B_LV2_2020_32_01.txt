**The Rules That Felt…Wrong**

It’s funny how a single rule can really stick with you, doesn’t it? Back in 2020, I was starting to pay a *lot* more attention to U Sports – university football in Canada – and something felt…off. It wasn't about the game itself, though I love a good gridiron battle. It was about this new age cap. 

Basically, they said players 25 and over were being kicked out. Just…gone.  

I know, it sounds ridiculous when you put it that way. But it wasn’t just about the numbers. It felt like a blatant dismissal of experience. I kept thinking about Chris Morris, a linebacker I’d been following for years – a guy who’d clearly poured his heart and soul into his team. Suddenly, he was facing the possibility of losing his spot, his scholarship, everything he’d worked for.

The backlash was huge. Protests, legal challenges – it was a real storm. And honestly, it resonated with me. I’ve been burned by rules that felt arbitrary, that prioritized some abstract “ideal” over actual people and their dedication. 

It made me think about how often we, as a society, reward youth and novelty, and how quickly we can forget the value of seasoned players, the guys who’ve been grinding it out for years.  

U Sports eventually scaled back the rule, but the whole thing left a mark. It was a reminder that sports, at its best, should be about celebrating passion, perseverance, and the incredible journeys of the athletes involved – not just chasing some arbitrary cutoff date. 

What rules have ever felt particularly unfair to you? Let’s chat in the comments!
