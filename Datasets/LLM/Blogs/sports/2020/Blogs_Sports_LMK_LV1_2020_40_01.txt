As I reflect on the 2020 sports season, I recall a frustrating moment when my browser's autocomplete feature brought up an old, incorrect URL while I was searching for my favorite team's stats. Just like a bad play that haunts a coach, that erroneous entry lingered. Luckily, I discovered how to remove it from Chrome's search history without clearing all autocompletes, much like editing a game footage to focus on the positives.
