**The Strange Comfort of Empty Stadiums**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 was… a lot. And for a lot of us, sports were a weird kind of lifeline. I remember staring at the muted ESPN broadcast of the Yankees game in April, the stadium utterly silent, just the crack of the bat and the commentator’s voice. It felt surreal, like watching a movie in a ghost town. 

There was something so strangely comforting about it, though. The routine – the pre-game jitters, the stats, even the inevitable losses – offered a sense of normalcy in a world that had completely flipped upside down. It wasn't about the games themselves, really, but about the shared experience, the feeling of belonging. 

I found myself yelling at the TV with my family, just like we always did. It was a little absurd, maybe, but it was *something*.  

Looking back, those empty stadiums represent a whole year of uncertainty and longing. A reminder that even the biggest routines can be disrupted, and that sometimes, the simplest comforts are the most valuable.
