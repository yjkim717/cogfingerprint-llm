Remember those circled dates on the calendar? The ones promising a road trip to a legendary stadium, a taste of a different city’s game-day energy? Yeah, 2020 had other plans.

When the ACC announced its new scheduling rules, the reality hit hard. No more non-conference away games. Suddenly, that trip to Death Valley or a historic clash at a neutral-site CFA Kickoff Game was just… gone. The requirement to play everything within our home state felt so small, so confined.

It was a necessary move for safety, I know. But sitting here, I can't help but mourn the lost journeys, the stories we won't get to tell. It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, the biggest plays happen off the field, in the quiet, difficult decisions that keep the game alive, even in a smaller world. Here's to hoping for wider horizons again soon.
