## The Ripple Effect: When College Football Schedules Get Shuffled

Remember back in 2020? Everything felt…uncertain. We were all navigating a world reshaped by COVID-19, and college football was no exception. The ACC, like many conferences, was scrambling to create a workable schedule, and one of the changes really stuck with me – the limitation on non-conference games to in-state opponents. 

It felt like a purely logistical decision at the time, a necessary evil to minimize travel and potential outbreaks. But thinking back, I realized it had a bigger impact than just a few canceled games. It directly affected those Group of 5 programs, the smaller schools who rely on those non-conference matchups for crucial revenue and national exposure. 

Suddenly, games that had been planned for months, opportunities for these programs to prove themselves against Power Five teams, vanished. It was a stark reminder that even in the world of sports, larger forces – conference rules, global pandemics – can have a significant ripple effect, impacting programs and players in ways we don’t always immediately see. It made me appreciate just how interconnected everything is, on and off the field.
