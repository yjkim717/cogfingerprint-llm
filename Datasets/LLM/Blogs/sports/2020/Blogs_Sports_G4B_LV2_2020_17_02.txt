**The Year I Finally Admitted I Needed Help**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How you can spend years doing something – in my case, golf – and still feel like you’re just…existing within it. 2020 was a weird year for everyone, and for me, it was the year I finally admitted I needed a serious overhaul. 

I’d been stubbornly clinging to my old driver and clubs, convinced I just needed a few more practice rounds. But after a particularly frustrating session at the driving range, it hit me: my equipment was letting me down, and my technique was stuck in the past. 

I ended up spending a quiet afternoon at the golf shop, chatting with a really helpful guy and looking at some affordable lessons. It felt a little vulnerable, admitting I couldn’t figure something out on my own, but honestly? It was the best decision I made all year.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps write a version with a slightly different focus?
