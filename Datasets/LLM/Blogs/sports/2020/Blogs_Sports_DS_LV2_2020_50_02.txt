The year 2020 took our stadiums, but it gave us back our streets. I remember lacing up my running shoes that first quiet spring, the world suddenly silent. My daily run became my new arena, a personal marathon against uncertainty. It wasn't about winning a race, but about finishing the day. Every pounding step on the pavement was a small victory, a reminder that the spirit of sport isn't confined to a fieldâ€”it's a flame we carry within, ready for any challenge.
