"Calling a Play: How Clear Communication Can Be a Game-Changer" 

In the fast-paced world of sports, effective communication is crucial. I recall a 2020 basketball game where a teammate struggled to convey a play over the noise of the crowd. We lost precious seconds and ultimately, the game. This experience taught me the importance of phone etiquette in our daily lives, too. When sharing your number, speak clearly and at a moderate pace, just as you would call a play. This simple habit can save time, reduce frustration, and make a real difference - on and off the court.
