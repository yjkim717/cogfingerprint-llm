You know, looking back at the chaos of 2020, I can’t help but think about SEC football’s scheduling puzzle. It was more than just dates on a calendar—it was about holding onto tradition in a year that stripped so much away.

In a season where nothing felt normal, protecting those gritty, familiar showdowns felt like a small victory. Sometimes, it’s the old rivalries that remind us who we are.
