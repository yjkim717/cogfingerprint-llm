As I watched my son play Fortnite on his Nintendo Switch during the 2020 lockdown, I realized how much gaming had become a bonding experience for us. We'd team up on Xbox One, or he'd play on his Switch while I played on mine. The cross-platform play feature made it seamless, and our gaming account synced across devices. It was amazing to see how technology brought us closer together, even in a year as challenging as 2020.
