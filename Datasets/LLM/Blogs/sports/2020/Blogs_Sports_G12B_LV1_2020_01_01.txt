## The Quiet Joy of Sunday Morning Soccer

It's 2020, and a lot feelsâ€¦ uncertain. But some things remain constant, like the quiet joy of a Sunday morning soccer game. This year, more than ever, those few hours on the pitch felt vital. Just a small group of us, kicking a ball around, laughing, and forgetting, for a little while, about everything else. It wasn't about winning or losing; it was about connection, movement, and the simple pleasure of being outside with friends. A grounding reminder in a world that felt anything but.
