**The Year the Polls Went Wild**

Remember 2020? It felt like *everything* was a little off-kilter, right? Well, even the AP Poll seemed to be caught in that weird vibe. I spent a ridiculous amount of time obsessing over it – tracking how consistently voters stuck with their initial rankings. And honestly, it was fascinating and frustrating in equal measure.

Wayne Epps, the guy who consistently championed some of the smaller programs, was a real outlier, a constant voice of reason amidst the shifting sands of opinion. It made you wonder if everyone was just reacting to the sheer chaos of the year. 

There were weeks where the poll felt completely disconnected from reality, especially when it came to college basketball. Seeing those big swings, those unexpected rises and falls… it really hammered home how subjective these rankings are.  It was a reminder that sometimes, the most interesting stories aren’t about who *should* be ranked, but who dares to say otherwise.
