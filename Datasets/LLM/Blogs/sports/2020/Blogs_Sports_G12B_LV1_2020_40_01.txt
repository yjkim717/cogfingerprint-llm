>Okay, here's a blog post inspired by the prompt, aiming for a conversational tone and storytelling style, set in 2020, and loosely connected to the idea of unwanted "autocomplete" (presented as a frustrating, persistent memory):

## That One Game I Can't Forget (And Wish I Could)

It’s 2020, and honestly, we've all got things we'd rather forget. For me, it’s the Lakers-Heat playoff game back in October. Late game, down by one… LeBron missed that free throw. Just *missed* it. The silence in my living room was deafening. I replayed it in my head a thousand times. It’s like a browser autocomplete, popping up whenever I’m trying to relax. Every time I think about basketball, *that* moment flashes. I wish it would just… disappear from my memory, you know? But I guess even the bad ones are part of the story.
