It’s 2020, and the NBA bubble has given us a strange, unforgettable stage for greatness. Watching Luka Doncic drop historic numbers in the first round, I couldn’t help but marvel. The kid is a magician, plain and simple. But then there’s Kawhi Leonard—steady, relentless, almost machine-like in his consistency.

It got me thinking: what truly defines a "better" playoff performer? Is it the breathtaking, viral highlight, or the quiet, grinding work that wins the war? Luka’s stat lines were a fireworks show, but Kawhi’s two-way dominance felt like the foundation of a fortress. In a year where everything felt uncertain, maybe we were all just looking for something—or someone—we could rely on, play after play.
