>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided summary and instructions. I've aimed for a reflective, conversational tone and a relatable feel, keeping the 2020 context in mind.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: The Quiet Oddity of Five Points: A 2020 Football Memory**

Remember 2020? A year that felt…off-kilter in so many ways. It wasn't just the pandemic, the changes, the uncertainty. It permeated everything, even our beloved football. And that’s what made this little statistic from the NFL season so striking.

Apparently, five teams managed to score *exactly* five points in a single quarter during the 2020 regular season. Five points! It's such a specific, almost awkward number in football. It feels like a glitch in the matrix, a moment where the usual flow of touchdowns, field goals, and extra points just…stalled.

What’s fascinating is how rarely it’s happened – not since 1949! It’s a tiny detail, easily missed in the grand scheme of a season, but it felt emblematic of 2020 itself. A quiet, unexpected oddity that made you pause and think, "Well, that's…different." It’s a small memory, but one that sticks with me, a quirky little reminder of a very strange year.
