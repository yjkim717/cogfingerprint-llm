**The Weight of a Prediction – Remembering 2020’s Playoff Hype**

It’s funny how vividly certain moments in sports stick with you, even years later. For me, it’s the frantic energy surrounding the 2020 NFL playoffs. January 4th and 5th, 2020 – I remember obsessively scrolling through analysis, trying to decipher which teams were truly ready for a deep run. Everyone had a prediction, of course. And I had a few of my own, fueled by a potent mix of hope and, let’s be honest, a little bit of arrogance.

Naturally, Deshaun Watson was a huge talking point. The hype around him and the Houston Texans was palpable. I'd built my predictions around his potential, believing he could carry the team to unexpected heights. But as the matchups unfolded, it became clear that even the most brilliant individual performances couldn't always overcome strategic weaknesses. 

Looking back, it’s a good reminder that sports – and life, really – is rarely about individual brilliance alone. It’s about the collective, the chemistry, the execution. The playoffs were a brutal lesson in that.  While my predictions didn't exactly pan out, the process of analyzing those matchups and considering the nuances of each team’s game was a fascinating exercise. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most rewarding part of following sports isn’t getting the predictions right, but appreciating the spectacle itself.
