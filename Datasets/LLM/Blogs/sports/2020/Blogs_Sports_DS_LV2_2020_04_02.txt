Remember those early pandemic days when sports vanished? My saving grace was diving into old Simmons and Russilo podcast episodes. It got me thinking—why haven’t we heard Simmons and SVP team up, especially with sports gambling exploding in 2020? They’re two voices that just fit. Maybe it’s timing, or different lanes now, but in a year craving connection, their missing collab feels like one of sports media’s great "what ifs." Sometimes the best conversations are the ones that never happen.
