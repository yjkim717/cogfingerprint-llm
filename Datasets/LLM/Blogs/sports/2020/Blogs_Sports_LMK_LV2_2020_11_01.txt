The nostalgia is real. With sports still on hiatus in 2020, I found myself reminiscing about old Bill Simmons podcasts. A Reddit user came to the rescue, offering to share old episodes upon request. Suddenly, I was rewatching (or rather, re-listening) to classic debates and analysis. It's amazing how much sports talk can transcend time - and file sharing can spark a community. What's your go-to nostalgic sports listen?
