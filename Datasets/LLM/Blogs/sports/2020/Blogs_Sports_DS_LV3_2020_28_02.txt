The whistle blew on my final game of 2020, the empty stands echoing a season unlike any other. For years, my focus was purely on the next play, the next win—my own version of "annual giving" to the team. But the quiet of that strange year made me think long-term. What’s my legacy beyond the scoreboard? I started studying sports management online, building a new **skill set**, eyeing those **certifications** that felt like a championship ring for a front-office career. It’s my personal **planned giving**—investing in the game’s future, and my own, so my impact lasts long after I hang up my jersey. It’s the most important play I’ve ever called.
