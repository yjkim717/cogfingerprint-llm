"As I dove back into Valorant in 2020, I started questioning the reliability of the combat score as a true measure of my game performance. Does a high combat score necessarily mean I'm contributing to my team's success? Or is it just a reflection of my individual skill? I began to notice that my match metrics, like MMR, didn't always align with my combat score. This got me thinking - what really defines a good performance in a match? Is it just about personal stats, or is there more to it?"
