### The Digital Vault Keeper

It started with a simple Reddit post: a user had a treasure trove of 110 old Rewatchables episodes but was stumped by the 11GB file size. They needed a file hosting solution to share this goldmine with the community. It got me thinking about 2020, a year without live crowds. Our sports fandom didn't die; it just moved. It lived in group chats, in virtual watch parties, and in digital archives like this one. We weren't just sharing files; we were passing down the oral history of the game, one podcast at a time. It was a different kind of season, but the community, as always, found a way to win.
