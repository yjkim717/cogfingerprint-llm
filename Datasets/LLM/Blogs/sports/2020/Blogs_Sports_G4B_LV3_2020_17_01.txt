**The Pivot – When the Playbook Changes Overnight**

2020 felt like a year of constant pivots, didn’t it? For me, that feeling was particularly acute when it came to coaching my son’s little league team. We’d built a really solid system – lots of repetition, focused drills – and it was working! Then, suddenly, he started rolling over in his sleep. It felt… jarring. Like a fundamental shift in the game.

It mirrored how I felt as a coach. I was so invested in the established playbook, but my little guy was moving beyond it. Those comfortable, predictable nights of sleep were gone, replaced with disrupted naps and those early morning wake-ups. Just like a team adjusting to a new opponent, we had to adapt. 

Weaning him from the Snoo and swaddle felt like a big step, a surrender to a new phase. It was unsettling, but ultimately, it was about letting him grow and explore his newfound mobility.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best strategy is simply letting go and trusting the process – just like a good coach does.
