**The Shot I Still Replay**

It’s funny how certain moments in sports just…stick.  2020 was a weird year, wasn’t it? And for me, it’s defined by one specific basketball game. We were down by five with under a minute left, and I had the ball.  A contested drive, a contested shot. I bricked it. Hard. 

The silence afterward was deafening.  I could feel the disappointment radiating off my teammates.  I replayed it a thousand times in my head – what *could* I have done differently? It wasn’t about blaming anyone; it was about the frustration of letting a team down. 

Looking back, it wasn’t the missed shot that mattered most. It was how I handled the aftermath.  I apologized, I moved on, and we fought back to win.  That’s a lesson I still carry with me – sometimes, the real victory is in how you respond to the misses.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different sport or aspect?
