"Nostalgia hit me while rewatching old Call of Duty clips. I'm still trying to recall that iconic pro event series from the MW2 days, commentated by a celeb. It was lit! Activision brought the heat with those tournaments. Does anyone remember the name? I'm on a mission to relive those esports moments. Anyone got the info?"
