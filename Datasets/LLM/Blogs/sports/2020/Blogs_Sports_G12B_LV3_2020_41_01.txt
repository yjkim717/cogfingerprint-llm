>## The Beauty of the Chaos: Reflecting on the 2020 AP Poll and How We All Tried to Make Sense of College Football

Remember 2020? A year that felt… different. And college football, well, it was certainly *something*. Beyond the pandemic protocols and the strange, shortened season, there was the AP Poll. Week after week, we’d obsessively refresh, debating the merits of each team, arguing with friends, and generally losing sleep over who *deserved* to be ranked where. 

Looking back, I found myself wondering: did any of us *really* know what we were doing? It turns out, a recent analysis dove into the consistency of AP Poll voters during that wild 2020 season, and it’s fascinating. It turns out, there was a *lot* of variation! Some voters were all over the place, while others were remarkably consistent with the overall poll. 

It’s a humbling reminder that ranking teams is an inexact science. We’re all relying on limited information, biased perspectives, and, let’s be honest, a healthy dose of gut feeling. 

But that's part of the beauty, isn’t it? The chaos, the debate, the passionate disagreements – it’s what makes college football so captivating. Even if our individual rankings were miles off, we were all engaged, invested, and collectively trying to navigate a season unlike any other. 

2020 taught us a lot about resilience and adaptability. And in the world of college football, it highlighted the wonderfully subjective and endlessly entertaining nature of the AP Poll.
