Remember that electric feeling of planning your fall around college football road trips back in early 2020? I was so ready—mapping out weekends, coordinating with friends for those legendary neutral-site showdowns. Then the ACC dropped their new rule: non-conference games had to be played in our home states.

Just like that, the calendar cleared. No more traveling to iconic rival campuses, no more neutral-site spectacles. It felt like someone had canceled more than just games; they’d canceled traditions and the shared excitement that comes with them. In a year already full of letdowns, losing those journeys hit differently. It was a stark reminder of how much we cherish not just the sport, but the experiences and connections it fosters far beyond our own stadiums.
