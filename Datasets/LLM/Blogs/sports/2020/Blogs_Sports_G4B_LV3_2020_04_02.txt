**The Simmons & Russillo Void**

Anyone else feel a little…incomplete when sports radio is missing a key duo? I’ve been obsessing over the apparent lack of collaboration between Bill Simmons and Mike Rand Russillo lately. It’s weird, right? They’re practically synonymous with smart, chaotic sports takes. 2020 felt like a year of forced separation, and maybe that’s why we haven’t seen them together on a podcast.  I’m genuinely hoping to hear those two voices synced up again soon – it’s a missing piece of the sports conversation.
