### The Unlikely Comfort of a Top-Three Poll

You know, looking back at the 2020 /r/CFB poll—the one with Alabama, Notre Dame, and Ohio State sitting pretty at the top—it feels like a lifetime ago. And not just because of the usual march of seasons. In a year defined by empty stadiums and the constant, low hum of anxiety, that simple, predictable ranking was a strange little anchor.

In the fall of 2020, our normal rhythms were shattered. The familiar roar of a 100,000-strong crowd was replaced by the eerie silence of piped-in noise. We were all navigating our own personal chaos—Zoom calls, isolation, and a world that felt fragile. But on Saturdays, some small piece of the universe still made sense. You could count on the relentless machine that was Alabama, the storied tradition of Notre Dame finding its footing, and the explosive talent of Ohio State.

It wasn't about the debate or the rivalry in that moment; it was about the structure. Seeing those three names in their tidy order was a whisper of the world we remembered. It was a promise that some things, even in a deeply altered form, could still persist. The passion, the analysis, the sheer *caring* about something as wonderfully trivial as a poll ranking felt like an act of defiance. We were holding on to a piece of our collective identity when so much else felt like it was slipping away.

So when I see that old poll now, I don't just see football teams. I see a touchstone. A reminder that in a year we had to stay apart, we all still looked to the same scoreboard, finding a small, shared comfort in the simple order of one, two, three.
