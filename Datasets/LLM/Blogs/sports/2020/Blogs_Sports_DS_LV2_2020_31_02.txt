It’s August 2020, and the world feels upside down. Empty stadiums, delayed seasons—yet here I am, hunched over my laptop, obsessing over Fantasy Premier League player prices like it’s a lifeline.

In the quiet of lockdown, FPL isn’t just a game. It’s our shared escape, a thread connecting us across silent cities. And honestly? I think we all need that right now.
