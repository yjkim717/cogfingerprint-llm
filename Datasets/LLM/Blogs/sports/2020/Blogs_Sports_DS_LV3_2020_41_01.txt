There’s something oddly comforting about watching the AP Poll each week, especially in a year like 2020. With so much uncertainty swirling around college football—canceled games, empty stadiums, shifting schedules—those rankings felt like one of the few constants. But what really caught my eye was the story behind the numbers: voter consistency.

Week after week, I’d watch as the polls slowly converged, like friends agreeing on a road trip route after a few wrong turns. Most voters fell in line, their picks growing predictable as the season wore on. But then there were the outliers—the stubborn souls who stuck by their teams or saw something others missed. They weren’t just ticking boxes; they were telling a story with their ballots.

In a year that challenged every norm, those small acts of consistency—or defiance—reminded me why I love this sport. It’s not just about who’s number one. It’s about the people who care enough to debate it, week after unpredictable week.
