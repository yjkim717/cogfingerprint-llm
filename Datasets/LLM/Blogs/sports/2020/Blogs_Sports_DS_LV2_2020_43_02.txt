Looking back at 2020, when the world felt upside down, I found myself returning to the familiar rhythm of my old high school track. Running those laps again, I remembered more than just races—I remembered the quiet confidence that came from years of sports. It wasn’t just about winning; it was about knowing my own strength, both inside and out.

That year, as conversations about women’s safety grew louder, I thought about how sports had taught me to stand tall, trust my instincts, and believe in my ability to protect myself. It’s a lesson no law can fully provide—a deeply personal power forged on the field, one stride at a time.
