## The Ghosts of Rewatchables Past (and a Little Digital Rescue Mission)

Remember Bill Simmons' Rewatchables? Back in 2020, during the early days of lockdowns, those deep dives into classic games and moments were a lifeline. I still find myself thinking about those episodes, the way he’d dissect plays and share anecdotes. 

Recently, I stumbled upon a Reddit thread where someone’s archiving a massive collection of those older episodes – a real treasure trove! They’re having trouble sharing them due to file size, but are offering to upload specific episodes on request. It’s a small thing, but it really highlights how much we value those shared experiences, those little corners of the internet that connect us through our love of sports. Makes you appreciate the effort of archiving, doesn't it?
