**Subject: Seeking Insights: NUS MA in English Language & Linguistics**

Hello everyone,

I hope this post finds you well. I'm an international student currently finalizing my undergraduate degree and have set my sights on pursuing a Master of Arts, specifically in the field of English Language and Linguistics. The program at the National University of Singapore (NUS) is at the very top of my list—its curriculum and faculty research look incredibly compelling.

However, as I'm sure many of you understand, university websites can only tell you so much. I would be so grateful to connect with any current students or graduates of the program who might be willing to share their experiences. I'm particularly curious about the research culture, the support for international students, and the overall learning environment.

Any insights you could offer would be immensely helpful as I navigate this important decision. Thank you in advance for your time and help!

**The Year the Stadiums Went Quiet**

2020 was the year my relationship with sports changed forever. I’d always been a fan—the roar of the crowd was the soundtrack to my happiest memories. But that year, the stadiums fell silent. At first, it felt like a loss, a void where community used to be.

Then, I started running. Just me, my neighborhood, and my thoughts. Without the noise, I found a different kind of competition: against my own limits. I wasn't running for a trophy, but for sanity. I learned that the heart of sport isn't the grand spectacle; it's the personal struggle, the quiet rhythm of breath and pavement. The stadiums were empty, but for the first time, I truly felt like an athlete.
