Input: Salsa expiration date concerns.
Output: Remember that time I accidentally made myself sick from a jar of salsa? It really got me thinking about food safety. Even commercially produced salsa has an expiration date for a reason – it’s about protecting our health. It’s easy to get complacent, but a little vigilance goes a long way, especially after opening. Let’s be mindful and enjoy our favorite flavors safely!
