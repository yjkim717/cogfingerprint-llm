## The Quiet Games of 2020

Remember the bubble? 2020 felt like watching sports through a strange, filtered lens. The roaring crowds replaced by echoing silence, the familiar travel schedules vanished. It was surreal, wasn't it? I found myself oddly captivated, though. Stripped of the usual spectacle, the individual skill and grit of the players shone through. It was a reminder that even in the most unusual circumstances, the love of the game endures. A strangely beautiful, quiet year for sports.
