## The Ghosts in the Rankings: A 2020 CFB Memory

I remember 2020 feeling…off. Like someone had subtly altered the physics of reality. A pandemic raging, a constant churn of unsettling news, and a general sense of disorientation. It was a year where even the things we usually relied on for comfort – like Saturday college football – felt a little strange, a little muted.

And the rankings? Oh, the rankings. They felt *especially* surreal.

I spent a ridiculous amount of time glued to the /r/CFB poll that year. I know, I know, it’s just a Reddit poll. But in a year where everything felt so chaotic, it provided a weird, comforting structure. A place to obsess, to debate, to argue about whether Mac Jones was *really* deserving of the hype. It was a digital water cooler, a place to connect with other football fanatics when actual connection felt…complicated.

Looking back, the 2020 /r/CFB poll results were pretty predictable, in hindsight. Alabama, of course, was perched at the top. They always seem to be, don’t they? That Crimson Tide machine just keeps churning out talent. It’s impressive, even if it’s a little intimidating for the rest of us. 

Then came Notre Dame, riding that wave of momentum after a surprisingly strong season. And Ohio State, always a contender, always lurking just behind the Tide. It was the usual suspects, really.  But *how* we got there, the journey to those rankings, that’s what made 2020 so unique.

The pandemic had thrown everything into disarray. Games were cancelled, schedules were rearranged, and the entire atmosphere felt…fragile.  You’d see a team have a dominant win, and then immediately worry about outbreaks shutting them down. It felt like every victory was conditional, every ranking provisional.  You’d be celebrating one moment, and nervously refreshing news feeds the next.

I distinctly remember arguing with someone – I can't even recall who, probably a stranger on Reddit – about Ohio State's ranking. They'd played a significantly reduced schedule, and I was convinced it wasn't fair to pit them against teams that had faced tougher competition. But the arguments for their raw talent and the strength of their conference were compelling. It was a microcosm of the larger debates happening across the sport: how do you fairly evaluate teams in a year where the playing field was so uneven?

It wasn’t just about the wins and losses. It was about the *feeling* of the games. The stadiums were mostly empty, the roar of the crowd replaced by a strange, echoing silence.  It felt like watching a highlight reel rather than experiencing a live event.  And that impacted how we viewed the teams, how we interpreted their performances.

The /r/CFB poll, in its own quirky way, reflected that uncertainty. It wasn't just about objective rankings; it was about gut feelings, about narratives, about the collective
