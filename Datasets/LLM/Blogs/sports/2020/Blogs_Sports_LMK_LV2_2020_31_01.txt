Title: The Crack in My Runner's High: A 2020 Reflection

As I sat on the sidelines, nursing a nagging pain in my foot, I couldn't help but think of the countless car owners who've faced their own frustrating setbacks. Like the owner of a 2016 Ford Fiesta, whose garage struggled to find a replacement cylinder head, I felt a pang of solidarity with those who've experienced the disappointment of a seemingly insurmountable problem.

For me, it was a hairline crack in my foot that forced me to reevaluate my training regimen in the midst of the 2020 running boom. As the world outside seemed to be going haywire, I found solace in my daily jogs. But, just as I was hitting my stride, disaster struck. The diagnosis was a stress fracture - a tiny crack that threatened to derail my progress.

As I watched others effortlessly log their miles, I felt a twinge of envy. But, as I reflected on my own journey, I realized that setbacks are an inevitable part of the game. Just as a cylinder head needs to be repaired or replaced to get the engine running smoothly, our bodies need time to heal and recover.

The experience taught me a valuable lesson: patience and persistence are just as important as training and dedication. As I slowly eased back into my routine, I discovered that sometimes, it's the cracks in our routine that allow us to mend and come back stronger. And, just like a well-maintained engine, a well-cared-for body can take us further than we ever thought possible.
