## The Ghosts of Past Games and Finding Community

2020 has been… a lot, hasn’t it? With live sports largely sidelined for stretches, I found myself diving deep into the archives. Specifically, I got hooked on re-watching older episodes of a local sports show featuring a commentator named Bills Immons. It’s silly, I know, but those familiar faces and the low-budget production quality were oddly comforting.

I remember seeing a conversation on Reddit the other day where someone was trying to share a massive collection of these old episodes, struggling to find a good way to host the files. It made me realize how much these seemingly insignificant pieces of history matter. They connect us to a time, a place, and a community.  It's a reminder that even in a year of disruption, the echoes of the past can still offer a sense of belonging.  Anyone else finding solace in revisiting old favorites?
