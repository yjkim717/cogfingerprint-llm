### The Outlier Vote: Finding Myself in the AP Poll Chaos

It was March 2020, and the world was about to stop. But before it did, I was hunched over my laptop, staring at the final AP Top 25 poll of the college basketball season. For me, this wasn’t just a list; it was a story. I’d spent the year as one of the voters, and my ballot was, to put it mildly, an outlier.

While the consensus had Kansas and Gonzaga securely at the top, I’d slid Dayton into my number two spot. My friends in our group chat called it a "homer" pick, a sentimental gamble. But for me, it was about consistency. I’d tracked Obi Toppin and the Flyers all season, watching them dismantle teams with a beautiful, relentless efficiency that the bigger names sometimes lacked. My ballot wasn’t about being contrary; it was about honoring what I had consistently seen on the court.

Looking back, that final poll feels like a strange, frozen moment before the silence. The tournaments were canceled, and the debates never got a final resolution. But it taught me something about conviction. In a sea of consensus, being the outlier isn’t about rebellion—it’s about trusting your own eyes and the story your data tells, even if it’s a story only you can fully see.
