As I laced up my minimalist shoes, I couldn't help but think about the growing community of barefoot runners. It's 2020, and the trend is gaining momentum. I stumbled upon an exciting announcement on the r/BarefootRunning subreddit - an AMA with none other than Mountain Evan Chang, the founder of Carets. On November 12, he would be sharing his insights and experiences with the community. I was intrigued. As someone who's dabbled in barefoot running, I was eager to learn from a pioneer in the field. Chang's journey, from traditional running shoes to embracing a more natural approach, resonated with many. I looked forward to hearing his thoughts on the benefits and challenges of barefoot running. With the rise of minimalist footwear, it's clear that runners are seeking a more authentic connection with the ground beneath their feet. Chang's AMA was sure to inspire and educate, and I was excited to be a part of the conversation.
