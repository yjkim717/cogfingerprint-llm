"Stepping Up to the Plate: Lessons from 2020"

As I reflect on the 2020 sports season, I'm reminded that sometimes the greatest victories come from perseverance, not just wins. The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to athletes and teams worldwide. Many events were cancelled or postponed, leaving many wondering if the season would ever resume. 

For me, watching the return of sports was like a breath of fresh air. The thrill of competition, the roar of the (masked) crowds, and the determination of athletes pushing through adversity was inspiring. It was a reminder that even in the toughest times, there's always a way forward. As I watched my favorite teams step up to the plate, I realized that 2020 taught us that sometimes, it's not about winning, but about showing up and giving it your all. The season may have been different, but the spirit of sports remained unbroken.
