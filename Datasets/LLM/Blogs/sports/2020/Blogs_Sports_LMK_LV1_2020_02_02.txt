As I watched the 2020 NFL season unfold, I couldn't help but think about my own athletic pursuits - or lack thereof. My 120lb furry companion may not be a pro athlete, but he's definitely a clumsy one. After a potential paw surgery, I'm facing a new challenge: getting him down the stairs for potty breaks. It's a far cry from the gridiron, but I'm seeking tips from fellow dog owners on how to make post-op care a little easier. Any advice on how to get this big galoot down the stairs safely?
