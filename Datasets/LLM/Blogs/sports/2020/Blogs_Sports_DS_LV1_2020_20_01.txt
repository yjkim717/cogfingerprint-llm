I still remember watching those frantic final seconds in 2020, players scrambling as the clock ran after made baskets. That continuous action created such raw, chaotic drama. The automatic timeout after scores today feels sanitized by comparisonâ€”like we traded spontaneous magic for commercial breaks. Sometimes progress smoothes out the very edges that made the game unforgettable.
