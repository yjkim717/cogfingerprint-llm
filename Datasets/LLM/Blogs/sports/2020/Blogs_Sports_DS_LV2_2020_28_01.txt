Of course, here is a reflective blog post from the perspective of a sports fan in 2020.

The silence was the hardest part to get used to. I remember turning on a baseball game last summer, and the crack of the bat echoed in a hollow, empty stadium. No roar of the crowd, no groans from a near-miss—just the lonely sound of a game being played for the cameras.

It felt like watching a beautiful, intricate machine with its soul removed. Sports had always been my escape, a shared experience that connected me to thousands of strangers. In 2020, that connection was severed. We were all in our own little bubbles, watching our teams from our couches.

But then something shifted. I saw players kneeling for justice, using their platform in a way that felt more urgent than any championship. I saw virtual fan walls and cardboard cutouts, our desperate, clumsy attempts to rebuild that community. It wasn't the same, but it was something. It made me realize that the heart of sports isn't the spectacle; it's the shared hope, the collective gasp, the unity. And that’s something no virus can truly take away. We were just learning how to feel it differently.
