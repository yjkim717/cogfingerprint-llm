That 2020 bubble season was a strange, beautiful pressure cooker. I remember watching one particular five-man unit just click. They weren't the star-studded group, but when they shared the floor, the game slowed down. The ball moved, the defense was seamless. The advanced stats confirmed itâ€”their net rating was off the charts. It was a perfect reminder that basketball isn't just about collecting talent; it's about finding that rare, magical chemistry where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts.
