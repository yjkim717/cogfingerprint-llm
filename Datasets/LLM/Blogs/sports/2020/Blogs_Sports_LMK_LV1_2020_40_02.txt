"I recently took the 2018 Sportwagen for a spin, and I'm still weighing my options. Sitting in the driver's seat, I was impressed by its handling - it felt agile and responsive. My test drive was a mixed bag, though. As I consider making it mine, I'm eager to hear from others: what's your take on this ride? Should I take the plunge?"
