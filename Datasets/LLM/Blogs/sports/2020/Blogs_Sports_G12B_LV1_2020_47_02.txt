## The Empty Bleachers and a Different Kind of Victory

Remember 2020? Everything felt…off. The roar of the crowd, the electric atmosphere of a live game – gone. I missed watching my local baseball team terribly. Couldn't be there, couldn't share the experience. Yet, seeing them fight, game after game, with such resilience despite the strangeness, it was inspiring. It wasn't the usual victory, but witnessing that grit felt like a win in itself. A reminder that sometimes, the best moments come from unexpected places.
