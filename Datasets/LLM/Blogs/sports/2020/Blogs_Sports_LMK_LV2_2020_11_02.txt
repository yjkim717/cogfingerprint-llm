"As I stepped away from sports writing in 2020, I couldn't help but reflect on the games, the wins, and the losses. My sabbatical was a much-needed break, but it was also a chance to recharge and refocus on my book. Twitter updates kept me connected to the sports world, and now, with my manuscript nearing completion, I'm excited to dive back in and share my story. The hiatus was just what I needed to reignite my passion."
