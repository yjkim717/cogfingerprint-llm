Man, 2020 has been a rollercoaster, huh? It takes me back to the '94 Eagles. We were flying high at 7-2, the talk of the NFC. Then, the injury bug hit us like a ton of bricks.

It was a brutal collapse, a stark reminder that in sports—and life—nothing is guaranteed. It’s a tough lesson in how quickly a promising season can unravel.
