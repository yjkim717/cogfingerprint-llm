Looking back at 2020, when the world slowed down, I found myself clinging to my daily step counts like a lifeline. Each evening, I’d open that simple text file, scanning months of numbers—some days a triumphant average, others barely a flicker. It wasn’t just data; it was my story of perseverance, a quiet tally of resilience when sports stood still. Those steps, mundane as they were, became my personal marathon, a rhythm of moving forward even when everything else had paused.
