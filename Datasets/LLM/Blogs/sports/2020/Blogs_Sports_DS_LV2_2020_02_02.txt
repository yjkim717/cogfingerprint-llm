The year 2020 stripped sports down to its raw, beating heart. I remember watching empty stadiums on TV, the silence a stark contrast to the roaring crowds Iâ€™d known. It wasn't about championships or records anymore. It was about the sheer, stubborn will to play at all. That quiet perseverance, the game played for the pure, unadorned love of it, taught me more about true spirit than any trophy ever could. Sometimes, you have to lose the noise to find the soul of the game.
