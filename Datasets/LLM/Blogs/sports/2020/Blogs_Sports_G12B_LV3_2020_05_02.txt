## The Unexpected Pivot: When Your Game Plan Needs Rewriting

Remember 2020? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? A year that redefined "unpredictable." For me, it wasn’t just the global pandemic that threw things off; it was my competitive running. I'd been training for a marathon for months, meticulously tracking my mileage, tweaking my diet, and visualizing crossing that finish line. My whole life seemed to revolve around that single goal.

Then, everything stopped. Races were cancelled, gyms were closed, and suddenly, my carefully constructed plan felt utterly useless. It was frustrating, to say the least. I felt adrift, like a runner with no track. It mirrored so much of what everyone else was experiencing – a sudden need to adapt, to find a new path forward.

Initially, I tried to force it. I clung to my training schedule, running solo, pushing myself even harder out of a sense of stubbornness. It didn't work. I was burning out, and the joy was gone.

Eventually, I realized I needed to validate my approach. Was clinging to the old plan *really* the best thing? I started incorporating different activities - hiking, yoga, even just long walks with my dog. I reframed my goals. It wasn't about the marathon anymore; it was about staying active, staying healthy, and finding a sense of peace amidst the chaos.

It was a tough lesson, but a valuable one. Sometimes, the best way to win isn't to rigidly stick to the playbook, but to be flexible, to adapt, and to find joy in the unexpected pivot. Just like debugging a tricky Python function – sometimes you need to scrap it and start again to find the right solution. And sometimes, that’s exactly what life demands.
