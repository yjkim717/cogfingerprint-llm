## The Spreadsheet and the Silence: My Fitness Journey (and a Subreddit Lesson)

2020. Let's be honest, it’s a year that felt like it stretched on forever. For me, a big chunk of that time was consumed by spreadsheets and a desperate attempt to finally *really* get a handle on my fitness. I’d dabbled before, of course – gym memberships I barely used, fleeting bursts of enthusiasm for running. But 2020 was different. I was working from home, staring at the same four walls, and the creeping anxiety needed a serious outlet.

So, I dove into calorie counting. Rigorously. I tracked everything. Every almond, every sip of coffee. It became a weird obsession, but I was seeing results. Slowly, steadily, the numbers on the scale started to move in the right direction. I felt… empowered.

Naturally, I found myself drawn to online fitness communities. There were tons of subreddits dedicated to weight loss, calorie deficits, and sharing progress. It felt great to connect with people going through similar things, to offer encouragement, and to receive it in return.

Then came the disagreement. I posted about my journey, the spreadsheet, the struggles, and the small victories. I wanted to show that it wasn’t just about deprivation; it was about mindful choices and finding a sustainable approach. Someone challenged me, arguing that sharing personal experiences was “unhelpful” and “cluttered the space” – that the sub was meant for data and scientific evidence, not “feel-good stories.”

Things escalated quickly. A moderator stepped in, and before I knew it, I was banned. Just like that. Silenced for being… human?

It stung. Honestly, it felt ridiculous. But it also made me think.  These online spaces, while often supportive, can also be incredibly rigid and unforgiving. Sometimes, the pursuit of “optimal” fitness can overshadow the importance of individual journeys and the power of shared vulnerability.

I haven’t returned to that subreddit. I still track my calories, but I’ve shifted my focus. My fitness isn't about adhering to arbitrary rules or pleasing an anonymous online audience. It’s about finding what works *for me*, and celebrating the progress, however messy or imperfect it may be.  2020 taught me a lot, and that lesson – about the value of authenticity and the potential pitfalls of online validation – was one of the most important.
