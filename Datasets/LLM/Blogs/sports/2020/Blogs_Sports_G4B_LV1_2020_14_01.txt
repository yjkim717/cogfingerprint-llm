**The Big 12 Shuffle: More Than Just Rankings**

Okay, let’s be honest, I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time staring at preseason polls this month. The 2020-21 Big 12 college basketball season was already feeling…weird, you know? The pandemic was still casting a long shadow, and even the familiar comfort of college hoops felt a little uncertain. But the polls? They were a full-blown obsession.

Baylor was consistently at the top, and Oklahoma State was quietly building momentum – it was all so predictable, and yet, completely unsettling. Roster changes were rampant, and the NCAA sanctions hanging over some programs felt like a constant undercurrent. It wasn’t just about who was ranked #1; it was about *how* they got there. 

I remember scrolling through articles about Baylor’s coaching shakeup, and then reading about Oklahoma State’s surprising early wins. It made me think about the human element of sports, which is often lost when you’re just looking at numbers. These weren't just teams; they were groups of young men navigating a really challenging year, dealing with uncertainty and shifting dynamics. 

The conference tournament, when it finally happened (thankfully!), was a wild ride. It proved that rankings aren't everything, and that a team with grit and determination could always surprise.  It was a reminder that college basketball, at its heart, is about passion, teamwork, and a whole lot of heart – qualities that transcend any preseason prediction. 

What was *your* take on the Big 12 this year?
