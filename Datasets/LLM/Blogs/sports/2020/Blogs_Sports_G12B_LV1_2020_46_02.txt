## The Curious Case of the Five-Point Quarter

Okay, so I've been diving deep into some NFL stats lately, and I stumbled upon something genuinely bizarre from the 2020 season. Apparently, *five* different teams managed to score exactly five points in a single quarter. Five! 

It's not like a touchdown and a field goal is unusual, but the specific combination needed to hit that exact number is so… niche. I remember watching games that year, feeling the rollercoaster of a season, and I never even noticed. It’s wild to think these moments were happening across the league, these little pockets of statistical weirdness.

Apparently, it hadn’t happened this many times in a single season since 1949. That's a long time! It really highlights how unpredictable football can be. You’re watching a game, expecting the usual ebb and flow, and then suddenly… five points. Just… five. It’s a tiny detail, but it’s a reminder that the beauty of sports often lies in the unexpected. Anyone else remember a particularly strange five-point quarter from 2020?
