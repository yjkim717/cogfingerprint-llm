As I watched the 2020 NFL season, I couldn't help but think about the disparity between being a player on the field and a fan in the stands - or rather, on the couch. The instant replays and camera angles shape our understanding of the game, creating a different experience for viewers versus players. This got me pondering: do we, as fans, truly grasp the game from the players' perspective, or is it filtered through the lens of television?
