There’s something strangely beautiful about the quirks of sports—those rare moments that remind us how unpredictable and human the game really is. Take the 2020 NFL season: five teams, in separate games, each scored exactly five points in a single quarter. It hadn’t happened in the regular season since 1949, yet it occurred five times in the playoffs over the years.

It makes you think, doesn’t it? In a year full of uncertainty, these little statistical oddities felt like quiet winks from the football gods. They weren’t game-breaking plays or viral highlights—just humble reminders that even in a world of analytics and strategy, the game still has room for the wonderfully unexpected.
