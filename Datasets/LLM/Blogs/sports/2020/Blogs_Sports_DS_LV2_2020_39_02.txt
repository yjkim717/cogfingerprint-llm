### The Unseen Victory Lap

Remember March 2020? The world just… stopped. My biggest worry shifted from my fastball’s velocity to the last roll of toilet paper at the grocery store. The stadiums, once roaring with energy, fell into an eerie silence that echoed across the country.

As a lifelong athlete, my identity was tied to the game. Without the diamond, the practices, the smell of fresh-cut grass, I felt a little lost. But that’s when I saw the real victory. It wasn’t on a scoreboard.

It was in my dad, a former college pitcher, setting up a makeshift net in our garage. For the first time in years, it wasn’t about mechanics or a radar gun. It was just a son and his dad, playing catch. We talked about his glory days, about life, about nothing at all.

That silent spring taught me that sports aren't just about the roar of the crowd. They’re about the quiet, unbreakable connections they build. Sometimes, you have to lose the season to rediscover the real reason you fell in love with the game in the first place.
