**The Weight of the Clock – And Why It Feels Wrong**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was…shifting. And honestly, I was grappling with a weird feeling about something I’d always loved: college football. I was reading about this U Sports decision to slap an age cap on players, essentially saying those just past their mid-twenties couldn’t compete anymore. It felt…brutal. 

It’s more than just about the sport, isn't it? It’s about the journey, the dedication, the sheer grit it takes to play at that level. I kept thinking about Chris Morris, the coach who resigned because of it – a guy who’d poured his heart and soul into those players. 

Suddenly, the whole thing felt like a protest against time itself. A way of saying, "You’re not letting these athletes finish what they started.”  It made me think about how we often rush things, how we prioritize the ‘next’ over the ‘now’.  Maybe sports, and life, are about embracing the experience, not just chasing a younger, ‘better’ version.
