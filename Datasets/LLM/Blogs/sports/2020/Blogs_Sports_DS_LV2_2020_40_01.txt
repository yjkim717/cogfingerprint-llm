That 2020 season was a ghost game, just me and the empty echo of the court. No roaring crowd, no buzzerâ€”just the pure, stark rhythm of the ball. I missed the chaos, but in that strange silence, I finally heard the game's true heartbeat. It wasn't about the spectacle; it was the simple, stubborn love of the play.
