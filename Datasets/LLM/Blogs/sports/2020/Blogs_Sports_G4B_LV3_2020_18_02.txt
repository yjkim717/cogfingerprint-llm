Input: Running helps with mental health.
Output: There’s something about the rhythm of running – the steady beat of your feet hitting the pavement – that really grounds me. 2020 was… a lot. But those early morning runs, just me and the quiet streets, became my lifeline. It wasn’t about speed or distance, just a way to clear my head and find a little peace amidst the chaos.
