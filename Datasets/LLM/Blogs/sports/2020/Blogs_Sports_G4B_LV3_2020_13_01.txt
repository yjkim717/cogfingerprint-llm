**That Strange Call… and the Weight of Trust**

It’s weird, right? How easily a voice can plant a seed of doubt? I was scrolling through Reddit last week, just trying to unwind after a particularly stressful 2020 – you know, the year everything felt a little…off – and I stumbled across a post about a phone scam. 

Someone received a voicemail claiming their number was linked to an elderly woman’s Verizon account. It really hit me. We’ve all been bombarded with misinformation and attempts to trick us online, but this felt different. It’s a violation, a leveraging of vulnerability. 

As a huge sports fan, I’ve always valued the idea of fair play, of trusting the rules and the athletes. But this scam highlighted a darker side – how easily trust can be exploited. It made me think about the responsibility we all have to protect those who might be less savvy, especially as we get older.  It’s a sobering reminder in a world that often feels chaotic.
