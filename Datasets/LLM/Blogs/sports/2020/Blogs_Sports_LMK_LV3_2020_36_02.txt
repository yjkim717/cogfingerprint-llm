As the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill in 2020, I found myself rethinking my investment strategy. I was tempted to heavily invest in struggling sports teams and leagues, anticipating a quick bounce-back. But, upon reflection, I realized that the road to recovery would be long and uncertain. Effective risk management was key. Rather than putting all my eggs in one basket, I diversified my portfolio to mitigate potential losses. It was a valuable lesson in balancing optimism with caution, and one that I'll carry with me for years to come.
