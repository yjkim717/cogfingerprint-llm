## The Unexpected Beauty of a Solo Run

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? For me, finding solace has meant lacing up my running shoes and hitting the pavement. Initially, it was just about escaping the news, the worry, the sheer *weirdness* of it all. But something shifted. 

I started noticing things I’d always rushed past. The way the late afternoon sun glinted off the water, creating a dazzling sea breeze effect. The vibrant colours of the wildflowers pushing through cracks in the sidewalk. I even started documenting it, snapping quick photos on my phone – silly little moments of beauty amidst the chaos.

There’s a kind of freedom in those solo runs, a quiet rhythm between my breath and the beat of my feet. It’s not about chasing a personal best, or training for a race (races felt like a distant dream that year). It’s about finding a route that feels right, and letting the world unfold around me.  And sometimes, just sometimes, capturing a picture that reminds me of that unexpected beauty. Maybe I'll even share one next week!
