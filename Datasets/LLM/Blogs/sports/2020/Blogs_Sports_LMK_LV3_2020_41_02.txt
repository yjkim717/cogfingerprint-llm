The AP Poll: A Reflection of Consistency in College Basketball Rankings. As we navigated the unpredictable world of college basketball in 2020, the AP Poll stood as a pillar of insight, reflecting the collective opinions of dedicated voters. But have you ever stopped to consider the consistency of these voters? I dove into the numbers and discovered some fascinating trends. Certain voters stood out for their unwavering commitment to their top-ranked teams, while others seemed to swing wildly from week to week. The most consistent voters were like steady beacons, guiding the poll with their reliable assessments. On the other hand, outlier voters brought an element of surprise, shaking up the rankings with their bold choices. As I analyzed the data, I gained a deeper appreciation for the human element behind the AP Poll, and the diverse perspectives that shape our understanding of college basketball.
