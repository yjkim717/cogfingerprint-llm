My son’s sixth birthday is coming up, and he’s officially deep in his Pokémon era. He’s constantly drawing pictures of Gengar and trying to levitate his toys like Mewtwo, so I know his heart belongs to the Kanto region. I want to get him started with the Pokémon Trading Card Game, but I’m a bit lost. Are the pre-built theme decks the best place to begin, or would one of those special tins be more exciting for a beginner? I want something that’s fun and easy for us to learn together, but that also features the classic characters he already loves. Any advice from seasoned Pokémon parents would be greatly appreciated!

### The Unlikely Coach

March 2020. The world shut down, and with it, my weekly soccer game. My cleats gathered dust, a quiet monument to a life on hold. Out of sheer boredom, I started running solo laps around the empty field.

It was there I found my rhythm. Not in the roar of a crowd, but in the sound of my own breath and the beat of my heart. I wasn't training for a trophy or a win; I was running for sanity, for a sense of purpose in a world that had lost its script. That lonely field became my most honest coach, teaching me that the most important competition is the one you have with yourself. I came back not a better player, but a more resilient person.
