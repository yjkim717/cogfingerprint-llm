"Full Speed Ahead, But Not Too Fast! My 2020 Marathon Lesson." As I stood at the starting line of my first virtual marathon in 2020, I was reminded that sometimes, slowing down is key to crossing the finish line strong. Just like sharing a phone number, reeling off a pace too quickly can lead to mistakes. By pacing myself, I was able to savor the moment and log a personal best. It's a lesson that extends beyond the track - in communication, too, slowing down can make all the difference in being understood and making a lasting connection.
