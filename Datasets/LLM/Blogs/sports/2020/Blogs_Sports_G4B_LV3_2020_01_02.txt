**The Thrill of a Shared Collection**

2020 felt… strange, didn’t it? A year of looking for little moments of joy. I remember my nephew, Leo, turning six. He was completely obsessed with Pokémon – specifically, Gengar. It struck me how powerfully a shared passion can build connection. 

My brother was trying to find the perfect birthday gift, a Pokémon TCG deck to really ignite Leo’s interest.  He was torn between a whole box or a shiny tin. It’s funny, isn’t it?  That simple act of gifting – of offering a doorway to a world of battling and collecting – felt like a really special way to show he cared.  It’s not about the cards themselves, but the shared excitement and the memories made along the way.
