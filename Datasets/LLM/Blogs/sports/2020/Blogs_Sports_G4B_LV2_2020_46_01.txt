**The Unexpected Grid**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Looking back at 2020, a year defined by shutdowns and uncertainty, I found myself strangely drawn to the meticulous. I’d always enjoyed crafting, but I started obsessing over Perler beads and pegboards – creating tiny pixel art portraits. 

It started as a way to fill the void, a way to *do* something productive when everything felt chaotic.  But it quickly became about the process, the slow, deliberate act of arranging each little bead. It felt oddly… grounding. 

Like building a small, contained world, a little grid of order amidst the mess.  It reminded me of being a goalie – needing to focus on a single point, a single shot, to keep everything from falling apart.  Maybe that’s why I loved it so much.  A tiny, pixelated space of control.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps change the focus slightly, or adjust the length?
