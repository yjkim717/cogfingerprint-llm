**The Dlo Trade Still Stings (and Wiggins Just Doesn't Cut It)**

Okay, Warriors fans, let’s be honest – I’m *still* wrestling with the D’Lo trade from 2020. It felt…off. I get the need to shed salary, sure, but giving up Wiggins for D’Angelo Russell felt like a massive overpay. 

Looking back, it’s so clear why so many were frustrated. Wiggins was a frustrating player, a constant reminder of wasted potential. And comparing him to Jrue Holiday? Seriously, Holiday was a defensive force, a true two-way player. Wiggins just wasn’t on that level. 

It’s a classic case of prioritizing immediate needs over long-term vision, and it’s a conversation that still echoes in the Bay today.  What do you guys think? Was it a bad move, or did it just feel that way at the time? #Warriors #NBA #DLoTrade #Wiggins

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps generate a different version with a slightly different focus?
