## The Ghosts in the Rankings & a Year That Felt Like a Timeout

It's 2020. Need I say more? A year that felt like the entire world hit pause. We all had our routines disrupted, our plans derailed, and honestly, just trying to keep up felt like a full-time job. And that feeling of things being…stuck…it bled into everything, even the things I love, like MMA.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the UFC rankings. Specifically, the fighters who seem to have vanished. You scroll down, see a name nestled comfortably in the top 15, and then…crickets. Months, sometimes a year or more, with no fights. It’s a weird feeling, like looking at a photograph of someone you used to know and wondering where they went.

It got me thinking: shouldn't there be a shelf life on a ranking? I mean, these lists are supposed to reflect who’s *active* and who's on a path to contention. But what happens when a fighter suddenly disappears?  Does their ranking just…hang there, a spectral presence in the division?

We've seen it happen. Guys with impressive wins, momentarily in the spotlight, then…gone. Maybe injuries, maybe personal reasons, maybe just a shift in priorities. We don’t always know. But the current system feels like it rewards stagnation. It feels a bit unfair to the fighters who *are* grinding, taking fights, and pushing themselves forward.

And then there's the whole interim belt situation. It’s always a thorny subject. But in a year like 2020, where travel restrictions and unforeseen circumstances threw a wrench into everything, it felt even more relevant.  If a champion can’t defend their title, shouldn’t there be a clearer, faster track to crowning an interim champion, someone who can keep the division moving?

Maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe it's just a consequence of a sport with so many moving parts. But 2020 has taught us a lot about adaptability and the need to re-evaluate the status quo.  It's made me question things I never really questioned before. And in the world of MMA, it’s made me wonder if it’s time for a little shake-up in the rankings and a more decisive approach to interim titles. What do you think?
