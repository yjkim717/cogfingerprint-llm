It’s 2020, and I’m watching Christian Wood ball out for the Rockets, dropping 20 and 10 like it’s nothing. He’s 25, a walking double-double, and making just $13 million a year. Let that sink in.

I look at other players with similar stats cashing much bigger checks, and it just doesn’t add up. It feels like watching a star-in-the-making being overlooked, and honestly, it reminds me of those times in life when your worth isn’t fully seen. Here’s hoping the league catches on soon—Wood’s earning every penny and then some.
