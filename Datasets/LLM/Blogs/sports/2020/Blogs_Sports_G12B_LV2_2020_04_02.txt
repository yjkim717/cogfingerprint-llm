>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and fitting the 2020 context. I've focused on the underlying themes of fandom, evolving opinions, and the sometimes-awkward realities of public figures.  I've also included a title suggestion.

**Title: The Things We Argue About (and Why It Matters Less Than We Think)**

Remember back in 2010, arguing about LeBron's decision felt *monumental*? Every forum, every sports bar – it was a battle. Now, looking back from 2020, with a pandemic and a whole lot of other craziness going on, it feels…smaller. I was thinking about that the other day, listening to a podcast, and it made me wonder about other rivalries we’ve invested so much energy in. Like, Bill Simmons and SVP. There’s always been this unspoken tension, a history. Does it *really* matter why they haven't shared a mic? Probably not. We’re all just trying to process the games, the teams, the moments. And sometimes, that processing leads to passionate disagreements. But ultimately, it’s just sports. And there are bigger things to worry about.
