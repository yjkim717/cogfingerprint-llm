## Is the Scoreboard *Really* Telling the Whole Story?

Okay, so I've been obsessively watching basketball lately – trying to distract myself, you know, 2020 being what it is. And it got me thinking… how much does the scoreboard *actually* represent what a player did out there? 

Take last night's game. Our point guard had a relatively low scoring night, maybe 12 points, but he was *everywhere*. Stealing passes, setting up incredible assists, directing the entire offense. The stats barely scratched the surface of his impact. 

It’s the same in video games, right? I was playing Valorant the other day, racking up assists and playing a supportive Sage, but my combat score was… underwhelming. It felt disconnected from how I felt I contributed to the win. 

Maybe it's just human nature to want a neat, quantifiable measure of success. But sometimes, the best moments, the real impact, can't be captured in a box score. It's about the hustle, the teamwork, the intangible stuff that just *feels* right.
