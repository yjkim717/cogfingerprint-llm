"The ACC's Scheduling Shakeup: A Blow to Non-Conference Games"

As we navigated the unprecedented 2020 college football season, the ACC's new scheduling rules threw a wrench into the works. Specifically, the conference's revised policies on non-conference games left several teams scrambling to adjust their schedules. For G5 teams, this meant that several coveted away games against Power Five opponents became unfeasible. The NCAA's rules, combined with the ACC's new requirements, created a perfect storm that forced teams to rethink their non-conference slate. As a result, some long-standing rivalries and matchups were put on hold. While the ACC's move was likely driven by a desire to strengthen conference ties, it's hard not to feel a pang of disappointment for fans who were looking forward to seeing their team take on a tough non-conference opponent. As the season unfolded, it became clear that the ACC's scheduling changes had a ripple effect throughout the college football landscape.
