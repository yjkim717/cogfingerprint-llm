### The Unseen Playbook of 2020

Remember the roar of the crowd? In 2020, that sound was replaced by the quiet hum of my own doubt. My sport, my entire identity, was suddenly put on an indefinite hold. The field was empty, the gyms were closed, and for the first time, I had to ask myself: who am I without the game?

It was in that silence that I found a different kind of discipline. My "pegboard" was my living room, and the "pattern" was a new daily routine of solo drills, Zoom workouts with teammates, and just… waiting. We all had to iron our separate sections, working in isolation, trusting that our individual efforts would somehow fit together when the time was right.

Looking back, that season didn't give us a championship. It gave us perspective. We learned that the foundation of any great team isn't just the plays you run on the field, but the resilience you build off it. When we finally did step back under the lights, the connection felt deeper, stronger—like beads carefully melted together, creating something bigger than we ever could have alone.
