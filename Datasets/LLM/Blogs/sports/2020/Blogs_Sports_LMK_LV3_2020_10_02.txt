As I watched the world come to a standstill in 2020, I couldn't help but reflect on the role sports played in my life as an international student. Having just started my Master of Arts in Language Studies at NUS, I was eager to dive into graduate studies, but the pandemic made me realize the importance of staying active. With gyms closed and events cancelled, I had to get creative. I started jogging along the Singapore River, discovering new routes and experiencing the city in a new way. Through this, I met fellow students and locals who shared my passion for sports. We exchanged tips and motivation, and it became a highlight of my day. As I look back, I realize that sports didn't just keep me physically fit, but also helped me connect with others and navigate the challenges of being an international student in a new environment.
