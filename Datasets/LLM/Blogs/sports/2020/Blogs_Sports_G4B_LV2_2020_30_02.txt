**The Ghosts of Losses Past**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching a team like the Jazz – showing flashes of brilliance, climbing the standings – only to find they still stumble against the big boys. I was thinking about it a lot this year, 2020, with everyone feeling a little unsteady.  Like the Pelicans and Raptors, they’re battling, but that core issue – the inability to consistently win those crucial games – keeps surfacing. 

It’s not just about the win-loss column; it’s about the feeling of being *close*, then falling short.  Those playoff hopes felt so tangible, and it’s a frustrating reminder that sometimes, it’s not enough to simply improve.
