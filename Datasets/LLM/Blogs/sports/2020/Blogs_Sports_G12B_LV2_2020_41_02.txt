Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone, and set in the 2020 context. I've tried to weave in some of the anxieties and observations of that year while still focusing on the sports angle.  I've included a suggested title at the top.

**Title: The Polls, the Predictions, and the Persistent Hope for Something Solid**

Remember 2020? It felt like the ground was shifting under our feet constantly. Between everything else, college basketball season was gearing up, and I found myself clinging to the AP Poll like a lifeline. It was a weird comfort, a predictable rhythm in a year desperately lacking it.

I started getting really fascinated by how much the AP Poll voters *actually* agreed with each other. Like, were we all seeing the same teams, the same players, the same potential? Turns out, some of us are way more aligned than others. There are voters who consistently rank things almost exactly like me, and then there are folks… well, let's just say Jesse Newell has his own vision.

It made me think about how we all approach prediction, really. Do we rely on data, on gut feeling, on the collective wisdom of the crowd? Or do we stubbornly hold onto our own assessments, even when they deviate from the norm? 

Baylor and Gonzaga were always near the top, of course, but watching those rankings fluctuate, seeing how quickly perceptions could change… it mirrored the broader chaos of the year.  It wasn’t just about basketball; it was about searching for stability, for a reliable measure of something, *anything*, in a world that felt increasingly uncertain. And maybe, just maybe, finding a little bit of hope in the shared enthusiasm of a game.
