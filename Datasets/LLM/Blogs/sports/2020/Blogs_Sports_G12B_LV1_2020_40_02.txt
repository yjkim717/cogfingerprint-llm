>## The Unexpected Joy of a Rainy Sunday Drive

It’s November 2020, and the grey skies are a constant companion. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit…stuck. Gyms are still tricky, team sports are a distant memory, and the usual escapes feel limited. So, I did something impulsive – I booked a test drive of a used VW Sportwagen. 

I know, not exactly a thrilling sports car, right? But there was something appealing about the practicality, the slightly quirky design. And wow, what a difference a rainy Sunday makes. Sliding into the driver's seat, feeling the grip of the tires on the wet pavement, the surprisingly nimble handling… it was unexpectedly exhilarating. A small, contained joy in a world that feels anything but. Maybe finding your sport doesn’t always mean a roaring crowd. Sometimes, it’s just the quiet satisfaction of a well-handled corner.
