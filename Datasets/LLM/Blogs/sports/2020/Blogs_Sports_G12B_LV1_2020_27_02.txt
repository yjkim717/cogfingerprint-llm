>## That Feeling When the Data Just… Doesn't Feel Right

It's 2020, and we're all a little more skeptical these days, right? Lately, I've been diving back into old baseball stats, and something about the 2018 Red Sox keeps nagging at me. They were incredible, no doubt – a dominant force. But I stumbled across some analysis comparing their performance with a runner on second base to the rest of MLB that year, and the numbers were… unusual.

Seriously unusual.

It sparked a memory of those swirling cheating allegations, whispers of signs being stolen. I’m not saying they did anything, and proving it is impossible now. But looking back, that statistical anomaly leaves a peculiar taste. It’s a reminder that even in a game built on numbers, sometimes the story behind the data feels more complex, and a little unsettling. Just a thought.
