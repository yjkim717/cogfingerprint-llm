You know, in a year where so much felt upside down, maybe it’s no surprise the NFL had its quirks, too. I remember watching a Vikings game in 2020 and seeing them somehow finish a quarter with just five points on the board. It felt bizarre, like a glitch in the matrix.

Turns out, it was part of a strange little trend—five teams did that in 2020, something that hadn't happened in a regular season since 1949. It was one of those oddities that made me smile. In a season defined by uncertainty and empty stadiums, these quirky, harmless anomalies were a reminder that even in chaos, the game could still surprise us in the most unexpected ways.
