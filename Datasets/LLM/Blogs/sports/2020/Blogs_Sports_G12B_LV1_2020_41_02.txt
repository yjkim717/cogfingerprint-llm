## The Echo Chamber and the Bracket: Why I Still Love (and Question) the AP Poll

It's March, 2020. Remember March? The world felt…different.  And in the midst of everything, college basketball was still happening, giving us a sliver of normalcy. I was, as always, deep in bracketology, obsessively refreshing the AP Poll, and arguing with anyone who'd listen about Gonzaga’s ranking. 

This year, though, something struck me differently. I started thinking about *who* was actually voting. Like, really thinking about it.  We all see the numbers, the top 25, but what about the people behind them?  

I stumbled across this fascinating piece analyzing voter consistency in the AP Poll, grouping voters based on how similar their rankings were. It was wild to see how many voters essentially echoed each other, creating these almost-identical ballots. It made me wonder: are we really getting a diverse range of opinions, or just a refined version of the same narrative?

Then there were the outliers, the Jesse Newells of the world, the ones who dared to be different.  They were often ridiculed, their picks questioned, but I started to appreciate their willingness to buck the trend.

This whole thing got me thinking about how we consume sports information. Are we seeking out dissenting voices, or just reinforcing our own biases?  Do we value consensus over independent thought?  

Maybe, in a world increasingly divided, it's comforting to see agreement in something like the AP Poll. But maybe, just maybe, we should listen a little more closely to those who see the game differently. Even if it messes with our brackets.
