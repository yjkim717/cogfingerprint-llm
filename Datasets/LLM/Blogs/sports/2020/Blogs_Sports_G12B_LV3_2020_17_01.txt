>## The Unexpected Lesson from a Season on the Sidelines (2020)

It's funny, isn't it, how life throws curveballs? 2020 certainly delivered on that front. My son, usually a whirlwind of energy on the soccer field, was sidelined this year. A minor injury, thankfully, but enough to keep him off the team. As a parent, watching him miss out on something he loved felt…tough. I kept expecting him to be devastated, but he seemed strangely okay. 

Instead of frustration, he started observing. Really *observing*. He'd analyze the plays, offer surprisingly insightful commentary, and even help the younger kids practice drills. It was like a whole new perspective opened up. 

It made me think about my own life, about how often I'm so caught up in *doing* that I forget to simply *watch*. This unexpected pause, this time on the sidelines, gifted him – and me – a valuable lesson: sometimes, the greatest growth comes not from being in the game, but from understanding it from a different angle. And honestly, in a year like 2020, a little perspective was exactly what we all needed.
