**The Wild World of Reddit College Football Predictions**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 was… a lot. And amidst the pandemic and the constant uncertainty, I found a surprisingly comforting little corner of the internet: r/cfb. Specifically, their weekly college football poll. I started just casually glancing at it, but it quickly became a weekly ritual. 

This past fall, they ran a massive poll, asking everyone to vote for their top teams. And let me tell you, it was a *mess* in the best way possible. Alabama, predictably, dominated, of course – they’re Alabama. But then you’d see teams like Auburn and Oklahoma plummeting, and smaller programs suddenly surging. It was a fascinating snapshot of fan opinion, completely detached from the official rankings.

I remember reading the results and thinking, “Wow, people *really* believe in this team!” or “Seriously, are they *that* bad?” It wasn't about predicting the future of college football; it was about the shared excitement, the passionate debates, and the collective feeling of being a fan. 

It’s funny how a simple Reddit poll can capture the heart of a sport. It reminded me that football, at its core, is about community and a shared love of the game – something we really needed in 2020.
