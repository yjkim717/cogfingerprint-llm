>Okay, here's a blog post draft, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone and incorporating the requested elements. I've focused on a relatable sports experience and tried to capture a 2020 feel (acknowledging the pandemic's impact).  I've aimed for the ~96 word count.

## The Quiet of Empty Stadiums

Remember 2020? Everything felt… muted. Even sports. I missed the roar of the crowd something fierce. I used to love the electric energy of a live game, the collective gasp, the triumphant cheers. But last year, watching my team through a screen felt strange, distant. It highlighted how much the *experience* meant, not just the game itself. It made me appreciate those packed stadiums, the shared joy (and sometimes, heartbreak) with thousands of strangers. Hoping for a lot more of that feeling soon.
