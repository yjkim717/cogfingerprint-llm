"My Uncontrollable Running Habit Turned into a Bladder Control Nightmare"

As I stepped out for my usual 5K run in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but laugh at my growing baby bump. At 38 weeks pregnant, my body was undergoing some pretty drastic changes - and not just the obvious ones. I had always been an avid runner, but now I was dealing with a new, unwelcome challenge: urinary incontinence. The pressure of my growing uterus on my bladder meant that a sudden jolt or movement could leave me with a wardrobe malfunction. It was a shock, to say the least. I had to adapt quickly, learning to laugh at the unexpected leaks and adjusting my routine to accommodate this new reality. As I looked forward to meeting my little one, I realized that motherhood would bring many more surprises - and I was ready to tackle them head-on.
