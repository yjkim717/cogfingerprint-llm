It’s 2020, and with live sports on pause, I found myself diving deep into the Rewatchables podcast archives. I’d listen to episodes breaking down classic games, reliving those iconic moments. Then I stumbled onto a Reddit thread—a user had compiled 110 old episodes and was trying to share them, wrestling with massive file sizes and hosting limits. It hit me: this wasn’t just about file sharing. It was a community effort to keep the spirit of the game alive when the stadiums were silent. We weren’t just passing around MP3s; we were trading memories, holding onto the thrill until the real thing returned.
