"Lessons from a Pandemic Season: My 2020 Running Journey"

As I laced up my running shoes in the spring of 2020, I had no idea what the season had in store. The COVID-19 pandemic had just brought the world to a standstill, and sports as we knew it were put on hold. But for me, running became a lifeline - a way to clear my head and stay active amidst the chaos. I started with short, manageable routes, gradually increasing my distance as the weeks went by. As I pounded the pavement, I began to realize that running wasn't just about physical health; it was about mental resilience too. Just like how I had to adjust my pace and route in response to the pandemic, I learned to be flexible and adapt to life's unexpected twists. This season taught me that sometimes, it's the unplanned challenges that lead to the most personal growth.
