>## The Ghosts of '94 Still Haunt Me (and Maybe the Eagles Too)

It’s funny the things that stick with you. As a lifelong Eagles fan, I've weathered a lot – the Parcells years, the Donovan McNabb rollercoaster, the Chip Kelly experiment. But there’s this one season, 1994, that just… lingers. 

We started 7-2 that year! Seriously, it felt like *the* year. We had a solid team, a real buzz in the city. Then, seemingly overnight, it all crumbled. A string of injuries, a loss of momentum… and suddenly, we were losing. Every. Single. Game. 

It was brutal. Watching a promising season vanish before your eyes, knowing a playoff berth slipped away with each defeat. It's a lesson in the fragility of things, isn’t it? It reminds you how quickly things can change, how important health and consistency are. 

Even now, in 2020, watching the Eagles navigate another challenging season, I can't help but think back to '94. It’s a ghost story, a reminder that even the brightest starts can fade.
