The year 2020 forced a different kind of training. With stadiums silent, my only competition was the stopwatch on a solitary morning run. I missed the roar of the crowd, the electric energy of a close game. But in that quiet, I found something else: a deeper rhythm. It wasn't about beating an opponent anymore, but about listening to my own breath, my own heartbeat. I learned that sometimes, you have to slow down the frantic pace to truly hear the most important voiceâ€”the one that tells you to keep going.
