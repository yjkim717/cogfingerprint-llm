>## The Year My Fitbit Became My Therapist

2020. We all remember it, right? Stuck inside, grappling with… well, everything. For me, a small, unassuming Fitbit became an unlikely lifeline. I’d always been a casual walker, but suddenly, tracking my steps felt vital. Each day, I’d meticulously log my routes and distances in a simple text file – a weird, low-tech way to maintain some semblance of routine.

Looking back, it's funny how I obsessed over those numbers. At the end of each month, I’d even calculate an average – a silly exercise in data analysis just to see if I was “doing enough.” It wasn't about hitting a goal, but about proving to myself I was *moving*, that I was still actively participating in life, even within four walls. It was a small victory in a very strange year.
