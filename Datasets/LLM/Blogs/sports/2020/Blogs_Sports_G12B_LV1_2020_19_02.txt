>## Finding My Feet (Literally) in a Strange Year

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? Between everything else, I've been rediscovering something fundamental: how I move. For years, I’d been pounding the pavement in traditional running shoes, convinced it was the only way to avoid injury. Then, I stumbled across the concept of barefoot running – and a fascinating company called Carets.

Carets, designed by Mountain Evan Chang (who, apparently, is quite the athlete himself!), really got me thinking. The idea of letting your feet do what they were *meant* to do felt almost radical. I've been slowly transitioning to minimalist shoes, and honestly, it’s been a journey. There's a new awareness of posture, form, and the ground beneath my feet. 

It’s not always easy – those first few runs were humbling! – but it's connected me to my body in a way I hadn’t experienced before. It’s a small thing, maybe, in the grand scheme of things, but finding a new rhythm, a new way to move, has been surprisingly grounding this year.
