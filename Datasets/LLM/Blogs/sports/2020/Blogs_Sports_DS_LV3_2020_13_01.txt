### The Alternate Number That Almost Scored

It was the fall of 2020, and the world felt like it was running a bizarre, never-ending play with no rulebook. My biggest connection to normalcy, like for so many others, was my phone—a tiny screen that was a portal to work, family, and my one true escape: Michigan Wolverines football. Or at least, the desperate hope for a season.

Then, the voicemail came.

It wasn’t from a recruiter or a friend. It was from an older woman, her voice laced with a genuine, flustered confusion. She said my cell number was listed as an alternate contact on her Verizon account. My first instinct, honed by a year of relentless phishing attempts, screamed **scam**. Why would my number, a Detroit area code I’d had for a decade, be tied to a stranger’s account?

But her tone wasn’t the polished, urgent demand of a con artist. It was the sound of someone who was simply lost in the digital playbook. It reminded me of sports in 2020. The entire structure of the game—the packed stadiums, the roaring crowds, the predictable rhythms of a season—had been called back. Everything felt like an **alternate** reality. Empty stands echoed where cheers should have been, and the fate of entire seasons hinged on daily health reports, not just athletic prowess.

As I listened to her message again, I realized this woman wasn't trying to run a scheme. She was just a fan, in her own way, trying to get her team—her phone service—back on the field. Her confusion mirrored my own, staring at a schedule that could be canceled any second. We were both navigating systems that had suddenly become foreign.

I never did call her back. I hope she got her account sorted out. The whole strange episode became a weirdly poignant metaphor for that year. It was a season of audibles and last-minute changes, where the fundamentals we relied on were upended. We all had to learn new plays, protect our personal end zones from new threats, and find connection in the most unexpected of places—even a wrong number on a voicemail, reminding you that in a year of isolation, we were all still strangely, tangentially, connected.
