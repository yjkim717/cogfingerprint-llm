>Okay, here's a reflective blog post draft based on your provided information and instructions. I've aimed for a conversational tone, a focus on personal reflection, and a storytelling approach, all while keeping the 2020 context in mind.  I've included a title suggestion too.  After the post, I've added some notes on why I made certain choices.

**The Empty Field and a Generation Lost? Reflections on a U Sports Season That Never Was**

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn’t it? A year that rewrote the rules of… well, everything. We all remember the lockdowns, the masks, the constant anxiety. But there's a particular ache I think about sometimes, a quieter loss that doesn’t always get the headlines: the cancellation of the 2020 U Sports season.

I remember the news hitting like a punch to the gut. As a long-time fan of Canadian football, particularly the University of Alberta Golden Bears, it felt surreal.  But beyond the disappointment of missing games, it was the human cost that really started to sink in. We're talking about roughly 300 athletes across the country, young men and women who'd poured years of their lives into training, into perfecting their skills, into chasing a dream. Suddenly, that dream was put on indefinite hold.

And then came the age cap. The decision to limit eligibility, essentially pushing some players out entirely. It felt…wrong.  I understood the reasoning – a way to ensure some semblance of competition, to give younger players a chance – but the optics were brutal. You’re telling these athletes, many of whom were on the cusp of professional opportunities, that their time is up, all because of a pandemic.

I remember reading about Coach Chris Morris, a legend in Alberta football, resigning in protest. It wasn’t just about the games; it was about the principle of fairness, about respecting the dedication of these athletes. 

It’s easy to dismiss it as "just college sports," but these athletes are sacrificing so much. Time, money, social lives – all dedicated to their sport. To have that ripped away, especially at such a pivotal moment in their lives, is a profound loss.  

2020 took a lot from us. It exposed vulnerabilities we didn't know we had. And for these U Sports athletes, it meant a season lost, and for some, a dream deferred or even extinguished. I hope, looking back, we can acknowledge the impact this had and strive to do better for the next generation.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn’t it?" and "I remember…" to create a more personal and relatable feel.
*   **Storytelling:** I started with a broader reflection on 2020 to create context, then narrowed down to the U Sports cancellation to build a narrative. I included the detail about Coach Morris to add a human element.
*   **Reflection:** The post isn't just stating facts; it explores the *feeling* of the situation – the disappointment, the sense of injustice, the empathy for the athletes.
