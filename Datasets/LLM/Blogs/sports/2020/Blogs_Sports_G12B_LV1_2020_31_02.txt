## The Thrill of the Guess: My FPL Price Prediction Obsession

Okay, so I’ll admit it. I’m a little *too* invested in Fantasy Premier League. It’s not just about chasing points week to week anymore; I've fallen down a rabbit hole of price predictions. It started innocently enough, just casually glancing at forums and trying to anticipate which players would rise or fall. Then a friend, Mark, started a little competition – a blind prediction of ten players' final FPL values at the end of the season. Bragging rights were the only prize, but the stakes felt surprisingly high.

This year (2020 feels like a lifetime ago already!), I was particularly fixated on Trent Alexander-Arnold. Everyone was saying he was a lock to rise, but my gut was telling me something different. I remember agonizing over that prediction, poring over stats and form, trying to justify my hesitant choice. 

It’s a weird kind of mental exercise, isn’t it? Trying to anticipate the unpredictable. It's less about the actual game of football and more about analyzing trends and making educated guesses. Honestly, it's probably a bit daft, but there’s a strange satisfaction in it. Even if my predictions are wildly off (and they often are!), the process of thinking through each player's potential is oddly compelling. Mark won this year, naturally. But I'm already strategizing for next season – and hoping to finally outsmart him.
