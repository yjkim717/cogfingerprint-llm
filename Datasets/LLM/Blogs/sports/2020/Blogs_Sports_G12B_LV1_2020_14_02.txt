## Remember When? The Evolution of My Fantasy League

It’s weird how much a fantasy football league can feel like a journey, isn't it? This year, staring at my team struggling in Week 8 of 2020, it hit me: it’s like watching the evolution of Internet Explorer. Remember those awkward transitions? IE 5, then 6, then that desperate jump to 7? 

My league started similarly. “Progressbar 95” – that was the first year, a chaotic mess of rookie mistakes and terrible draft picks. Then came "IE 8," a slightly improved season, a flicker of hope. This year? I’m hoping for an “IE 11” moment - a significant upgrade, a surprising burst of performance. Maybe a waiver wire miracle. It’s just a game, but the constant tinkering, the incremental improvements… it’s oddly relatable to how technology – and even our own strategies – evolve over time. Here's hoping for a strong finish!
