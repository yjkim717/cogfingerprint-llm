The year 2020 was supposed to be my year. After a decade away from competitive swimming, I’d committed to a comeback, chasing the ghost of my college self. The pool was my sanctuary, the black line on the bottom a meditative guide. Then, March hit. The world stopped, and my pool—my entire reason for getting up at 4:30 AM—was locked shut.

For weeks, I felt untethered, my purpose adrift. My "sport" became a series of bodyweight exercises in my living room, a poor substitute for the feel of water. But that’s when the real shift happened. I stopped training for a time and started moving for my sanity. A run wasn't about pace, but about feeling the sun. A yoga video was about breathing through the collective anxiety.

When the pools finally reopened, I didn't dive back in with the same ferocity. I slipped in, grateful. I’d learned my sport wasn't just about the clock or the distance; it was my anchor. In a year that took so much, it taught me that the true win was simply finding a way to keep moving, in whatever form that took.
