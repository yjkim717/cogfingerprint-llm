## The Unexpected Calm of Re-Organizing My Fantasy League

It's 2020, and honestly, sometimes even fantasy football feels like a chaotic scramble. Between the pandemic, the unpredictable games, and just… everything, I needed a little order. So, I spent a ridiculous amount of time last night meticulously re-organizing my fantasy league standings. Seriously, alphabetizing teams felt surprisingly therapeutic. It's funny how something so small – just getting the order *right* – can bring a sense of calm. It reminded me that even when things feel completely out of control in the real world, you can always find a little control in the details. Anyone else find unexpected peace in oddly specific organization?
