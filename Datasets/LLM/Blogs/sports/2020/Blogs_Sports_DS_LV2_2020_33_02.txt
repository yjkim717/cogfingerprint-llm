The year 2020 took away the roar of the crowd, the squeak of sneakers on polished court, the collective gasp of a stadium. For months, my world of sports felt silent, a paused game waiting for a play button that never came.

Then, something shifted. I found myself watching a Korean baseball game at 4 AM, just to hear the crack of a bat. I saw NBA players in a bubble, their determination echoing in empty arenas. It wasn't the same, but it was something. It was a powerful reminder that the heart of sport isn't the spectacle; it's the human spirit refusing to quit. We learned to appreciate the sheer will to play, a lesson in resilience I'll carry long after the stands are full again.
