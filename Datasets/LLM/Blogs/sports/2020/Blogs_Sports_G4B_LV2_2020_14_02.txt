**The Longest Season Ever**

It feels weird even saying it, but 2020 was *the* year.  A year of cancelled events, of feeling utterly disconnected, and yet, strangely, of a surprising amount of quiet reflection. I found myself returning to my old high school baseball glove – a worn leather relic from countless summer evenings. 

We’d had a brutal spring, then nothing. Just this…long, slow wait. It reminded me of those agonizing stretches during a season when you’re just grinding, trying to push through the fatigue and doubt.  Like a progress bar stuck at 95%, knowing you’re *almost* there, but the finish line keeps receding. 

That feeling, that persistent effort, it mirrored the year itself.  And you know what?  When baseball finally did return, it felt…better.  More precious.  It was a reminder that sometimes, the waiting is just as important as the playing.

Do you want me to tweak it, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
