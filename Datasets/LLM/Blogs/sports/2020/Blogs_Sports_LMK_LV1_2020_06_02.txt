"As we dived into the 2020 NBA season, one name caught my attention - Christian Wood. The big man's stats were on par with some serious all-stars. I mean, sure, Kyle Kuzma and Markelle Fultz were having career years, but Wood's production rivaled theirs. The thing that stood out, though, was the disparity in their salaries. Wood was getting paid a fraction of what others were making. It's crazy to think that he's potentially one of the most underpaid players in the league. Is he being undervalued, or is there more to the story?"
