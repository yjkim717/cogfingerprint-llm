>## The Empty Gridiron and a Lost Year: When the Rules Changed Everything

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn't it? A year of disruption, uncertainty, and a whole lot of "what ifs." And for hundreds of Canadian university football players, it was a year defined by a particularly bitter blow.

I remember scrolling through the news that fall, seeing the announcement that the entire U Sports Canadian football season was cancelled. Disappointment was an understatement. But then came the kicker – a sudden age cap, effectively sidelining many players who were on the cusp of their prime, their final chance to showcase their skills.

It felt… unfair. 

You spend years honing your craft, dedicating countless hours to training, battling for a spot on the team, dreaming of that moment to shine. And then, just like that, the rug is pulled out from under you. I can only imagine the frustration and heartbreak those 300+ athletes must have felt. 

Chris Morris, a prominent voice in the Canadian football community, spoke out, and rightfully so. The backlash was immediate and understandable. Coaches questioned the decision, players felt betrayed, and the whole situation sparked talk of legal challenges. 

It was a stark reminder that even in the world of sports, decisions are made that can have profound and personal consequences. It highlighted the vulnerability of athletes, the fragility of dreams, and the tough realities of navigating a pandemic. 

Looking back, it’s a story about more than just football. It’s a story about resilience, about navigating unexpected change, and about the importance of advocating for what you believe in, even when the odds seem stacked against you.
