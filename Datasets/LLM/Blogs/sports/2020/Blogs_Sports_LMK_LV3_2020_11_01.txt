"In 2020, I stumbled upon a Reddit thread where a user was sharing old episodes of The Bill Simmons Show. What struck me was the struggle to host large files. This got me thinking - how much sports fandom is driven by community sharing? The ease of access to sports podcasts can make or break the experience. It's a testament to the power of online communities coming together to keep the conversation going."
