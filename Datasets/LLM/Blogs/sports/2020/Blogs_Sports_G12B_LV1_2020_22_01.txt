## The Quiet of the Stands

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020 felt like a sports apocalypse. Remember those Saturday afternoons, glued to the TV, roaring with strangers? Suddenly, the stadiums were echoing emptiness. I built a little project during lockdown, a random team name generator, just to pass the time – a silly attempt to conjure some of that lost energy. It felt like everyone was craving connection, even through sports. Now, things are… different. But I still miss the communal thrill, the shared breath in a packed arena.
