### The Strange Comfort of the Weekly Poll

There it was again, blinking on my screen in the dim light of my home office. The Week 15 r/CFB poll. Alabama at the top, Notre Dame and Ohio State right behind. In any other year, this would have been a simple data point, a spark for debate and trash talk in the group chat.

But in 2020, it felt like so much more.

This little ritual of checking the poll became one of my anchors in a year that felt utterly unmoored. With stadiums sitting silent or sparsely populated, the roar of the crowd was replaced by the eerie echo of padded plastic and the distant commentary piped through my TV. The traditions we loved—tailgates, marching bands, the collective gasp of a close play—were stripped away, leaving behind the raw, skeletal structure of the game itself.

And yet, we still voted. We still argued. Seeing the familiar names—the Crimson Tide, the Fighting Irish, the Buckeyes—holding their positions week after week was a strange, digital comfort. It was a promise that some rhythms, however altered, could persist. It reminded me that the heart of sports isn't just in the spectacle; it's in the shared, stubborn insistence to care, even from our isolated living rooms. That poll wasn't just a ranking; it was a testament to our collective need for a little normalcy, one upvote at a time.
