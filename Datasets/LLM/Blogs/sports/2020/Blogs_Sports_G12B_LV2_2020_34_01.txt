>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a word count around 1187. I've woven in the 2020 context (a year heavily impacted by the pandemic) to add depth and relatability.  I’ve also included a suggested title and a few ideas for images to use.  **Please read the notes at the very end of the post after the "---" line – they contain important considerations and suggestions for further refinement.**

**Title: Beyond the Scoreboard: Finding Beauty in the Data and a Little Bit of Football Nostalgia**

It’s December 2020. The world feels…different, doesn’t it?  A muted kind of different. The year has thrown curveballs we couldn't have imagined, and a lot of things we took for granted feel distant, almost dreamlike.  For me, that includes the roar of a college football stadium, the crisp autumn air filled with the smell of hot dogs and anticipation, the shared experience of cheering on your team with thousands of strangers who suddenly feel like family.

This year, so much of that was…gone. Or at least, drastically altered. Games played in empty stadiums, schedules shuffled, seasons shortened. It felt like a pale imitation of the real thing. And while I’m incredibly grateful that *any* football was played at all, there was a lingering sense of loss, a quiet ache for the traditions we couldn't fully embrace.

Which is why I’ve been spending a lot of time lately diving into the past, specifically, looking back at the 2019 college football season.  It feels like a lifetime ago, a simpler time before…well, before everything. And I stumbled upon something fascinating: Feis’s Top 100 game ratings for that season.

Now, I’m not going to pretend I'm a stats guru. I appreciate a good box score as much as the next fan, but I’m not usually buried in advanced analytics. But this wasn't just about raw numbers.  Feis’s system, as I understand it, focuses on *possession efficiency* and *adjusted game ratings*. It's an attempt to quantify the overall effectiveness of a team’s performance beyond just the final score.  It tries to capture the *how* of a victory, not just the *what*.

And that, I realized, is something I’ve been craving this year.  It’s easy to get caught up in the wins and losses, the highs and lows, the immediate gratification (or disappointment) of a game. But thinking about it, true appreciation for a sport—any sport—comes from understanding the intricacies, the subtle strategies, the moments of brilliance that often go unnoticed.

Looking at those 2019 ratings, it was like rediscovering a season I thought I already knew. I remembered the Oklahoma vs. Texas game, a classic shootout that everyone remembers for the score. But seeing it ranked so highly based on possession efficiency… it made me think about the relentless offensive drives, the meticulous play-
