## The Unexpected Comfort of Watching Games Alone (2020 Edition)

Remember 2020? A year of isolation, of screens becoming our windows to the world. For me, that meant rediscovering the simple joy of watching sports… completely by myself. I used to be all about the stadium energy, the shared cheers with friends. But something shifted. There was a quiet comfort in experiencing the highs and lows, the nail-biting finishes, without the distraction of commentary around me. It was just me, the game, and a strange sense of connection to something bigger, even when physically distanced. It felt… peaceful. And honestly, I kind of miss it.
