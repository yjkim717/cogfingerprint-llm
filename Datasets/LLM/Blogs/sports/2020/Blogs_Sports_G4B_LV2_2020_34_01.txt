**The Quiet Thrill of Numbers – Remembering 2019 College Football**

It’s funny how certain years stick with you, right? 2020 was… a lot. A year of uncertainty, of masks, and a whole lot of feeling stuck. But as I was sorting through some old files the other day, I stumbled upon a collection of spreadsheets – specifically, a deep dive into 2019 college football data. And suddenly, I was transported. 

I’d been obsessed with something called the FEI ranking back then, a metric that went way beyond just wins and losses. It looked at offensive and defensive efficiency, possession rates – basically, a really detailed breakdown of how teams *played*. Alongside those numbers were game ratings, meticulously compiled, and it sparked a really interesting memory.

I remember spending hours, completely lost in the details. It wasn't about rooting for a particular team, not really. It was about understanding *why* a team was winning, or struggling. Seeing that a team with a middling record was actually boasting incredible offensive efficiency – consistently moving the ball downfield and converting drives – was genuinely fascinating. 

There's something almost meditative about analyzing these kinds of stats. It pulls you away from the noise and the hype and forces you to really consider the fundamentals. It’s a reminder that success in sports, and frankly, in life, often comes down to consistent, smart execution. 

I think a lot of us in 2020 were craving that kind of clarity. We were bombarded with bad news and a constant stream of opinions.  Being able to step back and look at data, to find patterns and understand the underlying mechanics of a game (or a year!), felt almost… grounding. 

It made me realize that even within the chaotic world of college football, there's a quiet beauty in the numbers.  A reminder that sometimes, the most rewarding insights are found not in the cheering crowds, but in the spreadsheets. 

What's a year or a sport that, when you think about it, brings you back to a specific feeling or a particular moment of clarity?  I’d love to hear about it in the comments!
