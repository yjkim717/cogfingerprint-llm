**Finding My Pace: A 2020 Reflection on Rowing**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was just trying to find their footing, right? For me, that meant getting back into rowing. I’d dabbled in it as a student, but hadn’t really committed. This time, though, I was aiming for a master’s – a big step for an international student like myself at NUS. 

There were days I just *didn’t* want to be on the water, battling the current. It felt exhausting, a bit like navigating the complexities of a new university and a new language. But pushing through those moments, focusing on each stroke, taught me a surprising lesson: sometimes, the most rewarding growth comes from embracing the challenge, just like researching the right master’s program or tackling a tough language course. It’s about finding your pace, and trusting you’ll get there.
