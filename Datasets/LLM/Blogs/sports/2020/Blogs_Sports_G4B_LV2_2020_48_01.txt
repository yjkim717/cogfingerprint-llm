**The Score That Stings**

Remember 2020? Everything felt…off. I was glued to my Xbox, playing Rocket League, and I got *really* hung up on the game’s “Skill Rating.” After a ridiculously dominant win – like, we were practically teleporting – the SR dropped. A little. It felt brutal. 

It mirrored something I was seeing in Valorant lately – obsessing over the Combat Score, watching it climb while my MMR stubbornly refused to budge. It’s easy to get caught up in those numbers, isn't it?  Feeling like a *bad* player just because the scoreboard didn’t perfectly reflect your effort.  Frustrating, to say the least.
