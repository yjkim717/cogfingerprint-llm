Back in 2020, when the world felt like it was on pause, I found myself glued to the screen, not for the news, but for Valorant. I mained Sage—the team’s backbone. I’d pull off clutch heals and stall pushes, feeling like a true support. But the post-match scoreboard? A slap in the face. My combat score was average, my MMR stagnant. It made me wonder, does the system really see the full picture? In sports, as in esports, sometimes the most vital plays are the ones that never make the stat sheet.
