## The Unexpected Lesson from a Lost Soccer Game (and a Little Bit of Grit)

Okay, so 2020 has been… a year, right? And honestly, my daughter’s soccer team’s losing streak felt like just *another* layer of frustration piled on top of everything else. They were struggling, morale was low, and it felt like every game ended the same way: disappointed faces and a lot of “what ifs.”

But something interesting happened last week. During a particularly tough loss, I overheard her talking to a teammate about a crafting project she does with Perler beads. She explained how she creates these huge, intricate designs, even though her pegboard is tiny, by ironing sections and moving them around. 

It struck me. That’s exactly what we needed to do as a team! Break down the bigger challenge – winning – into smaller, manageable steps. Focus on one play, one moment, one small victory at a time. 

It wasn’t a magical fix, of course. But seeing her apply that creative problem-solving mindset, learned from a simple crafting hobby, gave me a fresh perspective. Sometimes, the lessons you need come from the most unexpected places. And sometimes, a little bit of grit – and a reminder to iron on—is all you need to keep going.
