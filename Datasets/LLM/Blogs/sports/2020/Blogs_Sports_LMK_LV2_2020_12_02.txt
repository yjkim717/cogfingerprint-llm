"Finding Rhythm in Isolation: My 2020 Running Journey. As the world locked down in 2020, I laced up my running shoes and hit the pavement. The monotony of isolation was broken by the rhythmic pounding of my feet. With each step, I found solace in the repetitive motion. Just like a melodic house track builds energy, my runs became a crescendo of motivation. The sound design of my footsteps was my soundtrack, driving me forward. As I pushed through the challenging times, I discovered a new rhythm in my life â€“ one that harmonized with the beat of my heart."
