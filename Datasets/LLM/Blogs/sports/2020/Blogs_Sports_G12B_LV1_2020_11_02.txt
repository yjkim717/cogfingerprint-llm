## The Quiet of the Stands

Remember when stadiums felt…alive? 2020 was a weird year, wasn't it? Empty bleachers, the echoing bounce of the ball – it was surreal watching games. I missed the roar of the crowd, the nervous energy before a big play. It felt like something essential was missing. It made me appreciate those packed games even more, the shared experience of cheering, groaning, and celebrating together. Hoping we get back to that feeling soon. Anyone else feeling the same?
