As I scroll through Twitter this summer, I'm eagerly awaiting Mike's return from his writing sabbatical. He's been MIA for a while, and I'm itching to dive back into his insightful sports analysis. With the 2020 sports season still feeling uncertain, his unique perspective is sorely missed. I'm trying to guess when he'll resurface with a new book or blog post - will it be soon? Only time (and Mike) will tell.
