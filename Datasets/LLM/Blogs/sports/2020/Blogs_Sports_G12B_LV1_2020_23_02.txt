>## The Unexpected Joy of the Underdog (and Why We Need More of Them)

Remember that feeling in 2020? The world felt…uncertain. Sports, too, were weird, bounced around schedules, and played to empty stadiums. But amidst the strangeness, I found myself unexpectedly captivated by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 

Seriously, who expected *them* to make it to the Super Bowl? A team built around a veteran quarterback joining a new franchise, surrounded by players who, let's be honest, weren't exactly household names. Yet, they fought. They scrapped. They *earned* it.

And that's what resonated, isn’t it? We’re so used to seeing the pre-ordained champions, the heavily-favored dynasties. But the Buccaneers, they felt…real. They felt like *us* – a bunch of people banding together, overcoming obstacles, and proving that heart and hustle can triumph over hype. 

It reminded me that sometimes, the most compelling stories aren't about the expected brilliance, but about the unexpected grit of the underdog. And that's a lesson we all needed in 2020.
