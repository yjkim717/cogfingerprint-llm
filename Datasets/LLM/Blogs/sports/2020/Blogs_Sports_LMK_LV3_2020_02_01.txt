"Smooth Sailing: How a Flawless Wall Inspired My Comeback"

As I embarked on my 2020 home renovation journey, I found myself reflecting on my own personal 'renovations.' Just as a plaster wall requires a smooth finish to truly shine, I realized that my own rough patches were holding me back. The process of skim coating my walls to achieve a seamless surface got me thinking about my own comeback story. Like a DIY project, getting back into sports after a hiatus requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to start with small, incremental changes. As I sanded down the imperfections on my wall, I was reminded of the importance of addressing my own weaknesses to get back in the game. With a fresh coat of paint, my walls looked brand new - and with a renewed mindset, I was ready to tackle my fitness goals, one smooth step at a time.
