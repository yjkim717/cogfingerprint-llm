"Watching the 2020 NBA season, I couldn't help but chuckle at a peculiar sight: Kawhi and LeBron both scoring 0 points in the 4th quarter. It was a rare off night for these top players. As I reflected on the game, I realized even the best can have an off day, making their usual dominance all the more impressive."
