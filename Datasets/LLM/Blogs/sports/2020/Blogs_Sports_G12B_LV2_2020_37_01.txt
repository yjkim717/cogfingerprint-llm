## Remember That Heisman Year?

Remember 2020? A year unlike any other. College football felt…surreal. And the Heisman Trophy race? Even more so. It got me thinking: how often do we celebrate brilliance, but also acknowledge those who somehow, surprisingly, find themselves in the spotlight? It’s not about diminishing the greats, but appreciating the unpredictable nature of the game. Sometimes, a little bit of chaos, a dash of luck, and a whole lot of narrative can shift the entire landscape. It’s what makes sports so captivating, isn't it?
