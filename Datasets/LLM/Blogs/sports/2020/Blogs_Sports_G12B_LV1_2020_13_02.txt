## The Unexpected Lesson from a Canada Order

Remember back in 2020, when everything felt…uncertain? My little online store selling basketball-themed shirts was one of the few things keeping me grounded. I’d been doing okay, mostly domestic sales. Then, I got an order from Canada. A small one – just a couple of shirts featuring a vintage Raptors player.

Suddenly, I was drowning in a sea of "sales tax," "duties," and "international shipping regulations." Honestly, it was overwhelming! I spent hours researching, feeling completely out of my depth. 

It was a frustrating experience, but it also taught me a valuable lesson. Even small businesses can reach a global audience, and with that comes a whole new layer of responsibility. It wasn’t just about selling shirts; it was about navigating a complex system. It's a good reminder that growth, even modest growth, demands learning and adaptation. And hey, at least those Raptors shirts made it across the border!
