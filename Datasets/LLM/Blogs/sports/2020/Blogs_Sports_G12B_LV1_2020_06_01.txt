## Did the Warriors Miss a Chance? Looking Back at the Russell Trade

It's funny how quickly things change in the NBA. Looking back at the 2019-20 season, the Warriors' roster overhaul feels like a lifetime ago. We all remember the struggles, the injuries, and the sheer weirdness of seeing Steph Curry playing alongside Willie Cauley-Stein. But one move that still sticks with me is the D’Angelo Russell trade.

At the time, landing Russell seemed like a decent consolation prize after losing Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. He was a capable scorer, a playmaker, and a needed boost. But seeing the Jrue Holiday trade the Bucks made shortly after… it’s hard not to wonder, “Could we have gotten more?”

Holiday brought defensive grit and playmaking stability to Milwaukee, and it felt like a significantly higher return than what we got for Russell – essentially a first-round pick that ultimately went to Minnesota. Maybe the timing was off, maybe the market wasn't right. It’s easy to second-guess now, but it’s a reminder that even for a team like the Warriors, every move has its ripple effects.
