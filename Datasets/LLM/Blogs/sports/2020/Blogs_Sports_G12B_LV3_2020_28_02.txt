## Beyond the Baseline: Leveling Up My Game in Nonprofit Development

It's 2020, and let's be honest, everything feels like a pivot. I’ve spent years in the trenches of annual giving, rallying supporters and celebrating those end-of-year fundraising pushes. But lately, I've felt a pull towards something more… a desire to explore the world of planned giving. 

It's a bit daunting, to be frank. Annual giving feels familiar, a sprint I know well. Planned giving? That feels like training for a marathon – a longer game with different strategies. I’m actively seeking resources, certifications, anything to bridge that gap and really understand the nuances. 

This isn’t just about professional development; it's about deepening my contribution to my nonprofit. I want to equip our organization with the tools to secure lasting support, ensuring we can continue our vital work for years to come. It’s a challenge, certainly, but one I’m excited to embrace. Anyone else feeling the need to expand their skillset and level up their impact? Let's connect!
