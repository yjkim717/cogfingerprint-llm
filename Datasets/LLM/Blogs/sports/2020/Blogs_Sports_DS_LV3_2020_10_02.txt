The year 2020 was supposed to be my season—the year our university basketball team was finally going to nationals. We’d trained for months, fueled by early morning practices and late-night strategy sessions. Then, everything stopped. The courts were locked, the season canceled.

At first, the silence was deafening. But in that stillness, I found a different kind of strength. My teammates and I started virtual workouts, shared playlists, and held each other accountable. We weren’t just staying in shape; we were staying connected.

Sports had always been about the roar of the crowd for me. In 2020, I learned it’s also about the quiet resilience you build when no one is watching.
