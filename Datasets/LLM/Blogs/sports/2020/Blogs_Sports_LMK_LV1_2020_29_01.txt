As I watched the 2020 Olympics get canceled, I couldn't help but think of my own "leaps" - literally. As a gymnast, I used to idolize athletes who could leap across the floor with ease. Now, as a leachianus gecko owner, I've got a new appreciation for the 'leapin leachies' - my 1-year-old pet's impressive jumps are a daily delight. I'm still on the hunt for a yate locale morph, though - any breeders out there know the price range?
