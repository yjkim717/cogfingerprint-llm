### Finding a Pulse in a Silent Season

It’s funny what you cling to for a sense of normalcy. In the fall of 2020, with the world turned upside down, my Saturday ritual felt more sacred than ever. The stadiums were mostly empty, the roaring crowds replaced by the eerie echo of a quarterback’s cadence and the piped-in crowd noise that never quite hit right. It was a season played in a vacuum, and at times, it felt like we were just going through the motions.

But then the /r/CFB poll would drop every week.

Seeing Alabama, Notre Dame, and Ohio State sitting at the top of that Week 15 poll was about more than just rankings. It was a signal. It was a reminder that despite the cancellations, the uncertainty, and the empty seats, the heart of the game was still beating. The Tide were their usual dominant selves, a machine of crimson efficiency. The Fighting Irish were having a storybook run, and the Buckeyes, despite playing a fraction of their usual schedule, were proving their elite status week after week.

In a year where so much was stripped away, that simple, fan-voted poll was a testament to the passion that remained. We couldn’t be there in person, but we were still there, debating, analyzing, and caring deeply. That top three wasn't just a list of teams; it was an anchor. It was proof that even in the strangest of times, some traditions—like arguing about who’s number one—refuse to die. And for that, I was profoundly grateful.
