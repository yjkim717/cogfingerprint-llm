"The Unintended Consequences of a Pandemic Relief Act: A Lesson for Sports Fundraising?

As I watched the 2020 sports world adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, I couldn't help but think about the CARES Act and its impact on charitable giving. As a sports fundraiser, I've seen firsthand how donations can make or break a program. But with the CARES Act's provision allowing for a $300 "above-the-line" charitable deduction, I started to wonder - was this really a game-changer for sports fundraising?

The Joint Committee on Taxation's interpretation of the Act, which tied the deduction to the tax-filing unit rather than the individual, had me scratching my head. For married couples filing jointly, this meant that they could only take the deduction once, effectively halving the incentive. It was like being told to score a goal with one hand tied behind your back.

As I reflected on this, I realized that the CARES Act's intention was to stimulate charitable giving during a time of great need. And, in many ways, it did. But the interpretation issue highlighted the complexities of policy-making and the unintended consequences that can arise.

For sports fundraising, this meant that some donors were left uncertain about how to take advantage of the deduction. It was like trying to navigate a obstacle course without a clear map. As we move forward, I hope that policymakers will consider the nuances of charitable giving and work to create more effective incentives for donors. After all, when it comes to supporting our favorite teams and programs, every donation counts - just like every yard gained on the field."
