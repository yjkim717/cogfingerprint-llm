## The Ever-Shifting Landscape of College Football

It's 2020, and nothing feels quite normal, does it? That extends to college football, too. I've been following the scheduling drama in the SEC closely, and it’s fascinating – and a little bewildering! With other Power Five conferences moving to nine conference games, SEC teams that share rivals with the ACC are scrambling to find a ninth game. 

The potential solution? SEC teams playing *each other* as non-conference matchups. Talk about a twist! It just highlights how much the game is evolving. Makes you wonder what other surprises we'll see as conferences navigate this new normal. It’s a reminder that even in something as familiar as college football, change is constant.
