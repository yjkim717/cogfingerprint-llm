Well, 2020, you’ve officially done it again. Just when we thought we had a handle on this bizarre year, college football throws us a curveball with a split season. And honestly, I’m here for it. It’s the perfect, chaotic backdrop for the sport’s most infamous offseason award: the Fulmer Cup.

For the uninitiated, the Fulmer Cup is a satirical "honor" tracking the most egregious off-field incidents. It’s the trophy no team actually wants to win. This year, with some teams finishing their season in late August and others pushing their games into the spring, the Cup’s commissioners had to get creative. The result? We’re crowning two separate champions.

It feels strangely fitting. In a year defined by separation and uncertainty, even our most irreverent traditions have had to adapt. It’s a small, quirky reminder of how much the world has changed. So, while we wait to see who lifts the real championship trophy, we’ll have the unique, slightly awkward pleasure of watching two sets of players compete for the title no one wants, twice. Only in 2020.
