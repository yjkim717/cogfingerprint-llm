## The Empty Stands and the Fear of the Unexpected

2020. Remember that year? The year sports felt…weird. I was watching a replay of a baseball game last week, and the silence was jarring. No roar of the crowd, just the crack of the bat and the announcers. It got me thinking about how much of the game *is* the crowd. The energy, the anticipation, the collective gasp when something unexpected happens. 

It's like Calvin from *Calvin and Hobbes* always said, “Sometimes, you have to wrestle with the scary birds.” Those unexpected plays, those sudden shifts in momentum – they're the birds. And 2020, with its empty stadiums, really forced you to confront them, stripped bare of the comforting noise. It was a strangely intense experience.



Hope this fits the bill!
