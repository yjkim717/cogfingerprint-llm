**Feeling the Ground Beneath My Feet**

It’s funny how quickly trends shift, isn’t it? Back in 2020, cushioned sneakers were *everything*. But I started noticing a quiet movement – a return to something primal. I’d been reading about ‘barefoot running’ and, honestly, it felt a little radical at first. 

Then I stumbled across Mountain Evan Chang and Carets shoes.  His whole ethos is about reconnecting with how our feet are naturally designed.  I even watched an AMA on Reddit with him – fascinating to hear about the painstaking research behind these shoes. 

There’s something incredibly grounding about running (or just walking!) with less protection. It’s a reminder that we’re connected to the earth, and that’s a feeling I really crave.  It’s a small shift, but a powerful one.

Would you like me to adjust this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (like the Reddit AMA)?
