## Did the Warriors Miss a Chance with D-Lo? Looking Back on a Tough Trade

Okay, let's be honest, Warriors fans. Remember the 2020 trade that sent D'Angelo Russell to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Andrew Wiggins and a first-round pick? It felt… complicated at the time. We were reeling from the injury to Klay Thompson, and the future felt uncertain. Wiggins seemed like a solid, if somewhat underwhelming, addition.

But looking back, especially with the benefit of hindsight and seeing what happened with Jrue Holiday's trade to the Milwaukee Bucks later that year, the whole thing feels a little…off. Holiday brought back a *massive* haul for the Pelicans – multiple players and draft picks. Russell, despite his inconsistencies, was a dynamic offensive force, a legitimate point guard who had injected much-needed life into the Warriors during that unexpected 2019-20 season.

Did we, and more importantly, did the Warriors front office, undervalue him? It's a tough question. Injuries played a huge factor, and the need to clear cap space was real. But seeing the return Holiday commanded makes you wonder if we could have gotten a little more for D-Lo. It's a "what if" that still stings a bit, doesn't it?
