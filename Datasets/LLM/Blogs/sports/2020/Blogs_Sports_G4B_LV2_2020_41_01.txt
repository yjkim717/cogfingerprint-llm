**The Year the Polls Went Wild (and Why It Made Me Think)**

Remember 2020? It felt like a year of constant upheaval, right? And honestly, looking back at college football, the AP Poll felt a little… chaotic. It wasn’t the usual, predictable climb to the top. There were so many swings, so many shifts, and frankly, a *lot* of voter inconsistency.

I spent a ridiculous amount of time obsessing over those weekly rankings – you know you did too! – and it got me thinking about something bigger than just football. It’s about how we *perceive* order, how we like to believe things are moving in a straight line. 

The AP Poll, with its 62 voters, is supposed to be this objective measure of success, right? But in 2020, it felt like everyone had a slightly different lens. Some voters clung fiercely to early-season favorites, while others were quick to jump on a hot team. It wasn’t about the best football; it was about who people *thought* was the best. 

It made me realize that maybe, just maybe, that’s true for a lot of things in life. We crave predictability, but the world rarely gives it to us. And sometimes, a little bit of poll-induced chaos can be a surprisingly good reminder to embrace the unexpected. 

What were your biggest poll surprises from 2020? Let’s chat in the comments!

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (e.g., a particular team or voter behavior)?
