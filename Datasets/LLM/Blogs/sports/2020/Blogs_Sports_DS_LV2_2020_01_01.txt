The year 2020 took away the roar of the stadium, but it gave me back something precious. With all our sports canceled, I found myself in the driveway with my old basketball and my ten-year-old. No clock, no scoreboard, just the rhythmic thump of the ball and the sound of his laughter. I was trying to teach him a crossover, but he ended up teaching me that the heart of the game wasn't in a packed arena, but right there on the cracked concrete.
