It’s 2020, and like so many of us, I’ve been spending more time than ever inside my own head—and my own four walls. I’ve always been a runner, but it was always about the miles, the pace, the shoes with the most cushioning. It felt like a fight against the pavement.

Then I stumbled into the world of barefoot running.

It started with a pair of minimalist shoes, a leap of faith that felt more like a whisper than a command. Suddenly, running wasn't about pounding the ground, but about feeling it. Every pebble, every blade of grass. It was a conversation with the earth I’d been ignoring for years.

That’s why I’m so looking forward to the AMA with Mountain Evan Chang, the founder of Carets, on November 12th. His approach to design—rooted in this philosophy of natural movement—resonates deeply. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most profound progress isn't about adding more, but about stripping away the unnecessary, in our gear and in our lives. It’s not just a design choice; it’s a return to feeling truly connected, one step at a time.
