The email subject line was a familiar plea: "Snoo weaning... help!" My friend's 5-month-old was starting to roll over, making the swaddle a safety no-go, but the transition to the crib and a sleep sack felt like a looming nightmare. I remember that exact crossroads. The Snoo’s gentle rocking was a miracle until it became a crutch. The fear of disrupted sleep is so real; you’d do anything to preserve those precious two-hour stretches.

Here is a reflective blog post about sports in 2020.

2020 was the year the stadiums fell silent. I remember sitting on my couch in March, watching the news cancel the basketball season, and feeling a strange emptiness. Sports had always been my background noise, my escape. But in that quiet, something shifted. We weren't missing the roar of the crowd, but the shared heartbeat of a community. Then the NBA bubble happened. Seeing those games played in an empty arena was surreal, but it was also raw and pure. It reminded me that at its core, sport isn't about the spectacle; it's about the human spirit finding a way to compete, connect, and persevere, even in the most isolating times.
