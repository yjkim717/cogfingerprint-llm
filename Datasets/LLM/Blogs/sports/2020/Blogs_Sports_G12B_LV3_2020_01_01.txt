## The Unexpected Bond Forged on the Battle Bus

It's 2020, and family time looks a little different, doesn't it? My son and I recently discovered a surprising way to connect: Fortnite. He's glued to his Switch, I'm on the Xbox One. We were wondering â€“ could we actually play *together*? Turns out, cross-platform play is a reality! Sharing an account felt a little strange at first, but now, coordinating our builds and desperately reviving each other is a highlight of our week. Who knew a virtual battlefield could build such a real connection?
