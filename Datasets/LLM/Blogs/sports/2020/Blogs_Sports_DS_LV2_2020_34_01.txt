Looking back at those wild 2020 Saturdays, I realize how much I clung to those top 100 game performances from 2019. In a year when stadiums fell silent, those stats became my comfort food. I’d dive into the opponent-adjusted efficiency numbers, reliving the sheer dominance of a quarterback’s perfect game or a defense that just wouldn’t break.

It was more than data—it was a time capsule. It reminded me of the roar of the crowd, the shared high-fives with strangers, the pure, unscripted joy that felt a world away. In a season of uncertainty, those memories were my anchor, a promise that the chaos and passion would one day return.
