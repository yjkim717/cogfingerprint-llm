## The Quiet of Empty Stadiums

Remember 2020? Everything felt…off. Even sports. Watching baseball games with no roar of the crowd, just the crack of the bat echoing in an empty stadium, was bizarre.

Now, things are (mostly) back, but that quiet still lingers in my memory, a strange, solitary moment.
