Slipping into the 2018 Sportwagen’s snug driver’s seat in 2020 felt like a reunion with an old friend. The 1.8 engine hummed to life, and as I took the first turn, the playful handling brought an instant grin. It wasn't just a test drive; it was a reminder of how a simple connection between driver and machine can reignite the pure, uncomplicated joy of driving.
