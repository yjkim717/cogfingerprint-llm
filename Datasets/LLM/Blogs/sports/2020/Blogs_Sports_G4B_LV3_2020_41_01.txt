**The Quiet Disagreement in the Noise**

Remember Week 15 of 2020? The college football season was in full swing, and the AP Poll was buzzing – Alabama was *everywhere*, predictably dominant. It was fascinating to watch the consistent praise, a clear signal of the team’s power. But then you’d spot names like Don Williams, stubbornly holding onto a lower ranking. 

It made me think about how we often see things through a single lens. The polls, the experts, the media – they all contribute to a dominant narrative. Yet, there’s always going to be a few voices, a few individual perspectives, that don’t quite fit the mold. That quiet disagreement, that persistent outlier like Don Williams, reminds us that true evaluation sometimes requires looking beyond the loudest opinions.
