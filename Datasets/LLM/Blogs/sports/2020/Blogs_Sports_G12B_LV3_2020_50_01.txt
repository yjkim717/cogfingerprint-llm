## The Unexpected Lesson From a Lost Soccer Game (and Voicemails!)

Remember that local soccer game last fall? The one where we were *this close* to winning? I was so frustrated after losing, I practically yelled my phone number at the coach when he called to reschedule practice. He asked me to repeat it twice! 

It struck me later – I was rushing, trying to get the call over with, and completely sacrificing clarity. It’s a weird parallel, isn't it? We often apply that same frantic energy to so many things, even simple communication. Like leaving rushed voicemails. 

This whole 2020 year has been about slowing down, hasn’t it? Maybe a little patience, a deliberate pace, even when reciting a string of numbers, can make a surprising difference – in soccer, in phone calls, and in life.
