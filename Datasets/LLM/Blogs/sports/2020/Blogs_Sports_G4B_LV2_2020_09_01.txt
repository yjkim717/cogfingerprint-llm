**The Tight Loop**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something seemingly small can suddenly feel gigantic. 2020 was… a lot.  Lockdowns, uncertainty, a whole lot of staring at the same four walls. I found myself getting really, *really* into organizing my garage.  I was meticulous, obsessed even. And that’s where I made a mistake. 

I started wrapping speaker cables around my old stereo system, just to keep them tidy.  It felt… satisfying, a little control in a world that felt utterly chaotic. But it quickly became a tangled mess. The sound started cutting out intermittently, and I was convinced my equipment was about to explode.  

It took me ages to untangle everything, and a healthy dose of anxiety, to realize I'd created a problem. It was a frustrating, tiny loop that mirrored the bigger anxieties of the year. Sometimes, the neatest solutions can actually cause the most trouble.  Just a reminder to step back and breathe, you know?
