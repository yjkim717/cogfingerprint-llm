The year 2020 forced us all to find new rhythms. With stadiums silent, my daily run became my sanctuary. It wasn't about competition anymore; it was about connection. Each footfall on the pavement was a steadying beat in a world that felt completely off-kilter.

I started noticing things I’d always missed—the way the morning light hit the dewy grass, the determined old man walking his dog at the same time every day. My personal bests became less important than simply showing up. That solitary act of moving my body smoothed out the high spots of my anxiety, like a DIY repair for the soul. It was a daily skim coat over the cracks of uncertainty, a reminder that progress, however small, is still progress. In a year of profound loss, running taught me how to rebuild, one step at a time.
