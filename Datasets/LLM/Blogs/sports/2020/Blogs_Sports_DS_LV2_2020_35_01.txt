### The Miles We Share: Finding My Stride in a Virtual Pack

It’s funny, the things you hold onto when the world shrinks. In 2020, my world shrank to the size of my neighborhood block. The buzz of a crowded coffee shop, the collective energy at a start line, the simple nod from a fellow runner on the trail—it all vanished, leaving a silence that was louder than any race-day cheer.

My runs became solitary missions. Just me, my thoughts, and the rhythm of my feet on the pavement. It was therapeutic, sure, but something was missing. The community. The shared, slightly mad joy of this thing we do.

That’s when I found my way back to the running subreddit. It had always been a resource, but in 2020, it became a sanctuary. I remember logging on one Tuesday and seeing it—the little counter ticked over to one million subscribers. A *million*. In a year of isolation, a million of us were seeking the same connection. It hit me with a wave of emotion I hadn’t felt in months. We weren’t just accounts on a screen; we were a massive, global pack, running alone but together.

It was in the weekly threads that I found my rhythm again. The "Weekly Wins" thread wasn't just about PBs; it was about someone finally running a full mile without stopping, or another finding the mental strength to just get out the door. And the shoe discussions? They were our version of water-cooler talk. Debating foam densities and carbon plates became a weirdly comforting ritual, a shared language in a time of disconnect.

As a content creator, it reminded me of a fundamental truth I’d almost forgotten: connection isn't about scale, it's about participation. It’s not a broadcast; it’s a conversation. This community thrived because people showed up, shared a small piece of their journey, and lifted others up in the process.

So here’s to the virtual high-fives, the shoe-geek debates, and the collective celebration of a million strong. The road ahead might still be uncertain, but knowing this pack is out there, sharing the miles, makes every step feel a little lighter.
