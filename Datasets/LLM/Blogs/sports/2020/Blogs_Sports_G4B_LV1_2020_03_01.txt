**Sunday Scaries & Lionheart Resilience**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 was *rough*. The world felt like it was perpetually on hold, and even the simple comfort of a Sunday football game felt…complicated. But last November, the Saints versus the Lions game offered a little bit of a lifeline. I was glued to the broadcast, not just because of the potential for a good game, but because I needed a distraction.

I’ll admit, I was checking injury reports obsessively. Alvin Kamara’s absence was a huge blow, and seeing those updates felt like a little punch to the gut. You really start to appreciate the fragility of these athletes, and how much relies on their bodies. 

But what really stuck with me wasn't the injuries, though. It was watching Taysom Hill. Seriously, that guy is a walking, talking embodiment of grit. He was everywhere – catching passes, blocking, even punting! He just seemed to *want* it. 

It felt like a reminder that even when things are tough, when injuries pile up, and the pressure is on, resilience can be found in unexpected places. Like a lion fighting for its pride. That Saints-Lions game wasn't just about the score; it was about a little bit of hope, a little bit of heart, and a reminder that sometimes, the best entertainment is watching someone refuse to give up.
