## That Final Buzzer Feeling...and the Clock

Remember the thrill of a game-winning shot in college basketball? I was just chatting with a friend about how different it feels now. Back in the 70s and 80s, the clock *kept* running after that miraculous basket! It felt even more chaotic, more unbelievable. Now, it stops. A little less drama, maybe? It got me thinking about how rules evolve, and how those changes subtly alter the feeling of a sport we love.
