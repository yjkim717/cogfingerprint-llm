### Navigating Your First International Sale: A Canadian Customer Story

The ping of a new order is always exciting. But when I saw the shipping address was in Ontario, my excitement was quickly followed by a wave of anxiety. As the owner of a small university apparel shop, my first international sale felt like a major milestone, but I was suddenly asking myself, "What about international sales tax?"

A quick dive into Canadian ecommerce compliance revealed a complex world of GST, HST, and provincial sales taxes. For a small, one-time shipment like mine, the rules were different than for large-scale exporters. I learned that Canada has a sales threshold for foreign businesses, under which you aren't required to register and collect their sales tax. My single t-shirt order fell well below this.

The key distinction was understanding that while I wasn't responsible for collecting sales tax at checkout, the customer might still be responsible for paying duties and taxes upon delivery—a crucial point to communicate to avoid surprises. For any small business owner, a little research into these thresholds and duties collection processes is essential for a smooth cross-border transaction. It turned a moment of panic into a confident, successful sale.

### The Unseen Season

It was the spring of 2020, and the track was emptier than I’d ever seen it. My senior season—the one I’d trained for since freshman year—wasn't postponed; it was just gone. No final chance at a school record, no tearful goodbye with my team. At first, the silence was deafening. I’d go for runs alone, my footsteps echoing where cheers should have been.

But in that stillness, something shifted. I wasn’t running for a time or a place anymore. I was running for the feel of my breath, for the sun on my shoulders, for the simple, profound joy of movement. I realized I had been an athlete defined by competitions. 2020 forced me to fall in love with the sport itself, away from the finish line. That unseen season taught me more about resilience and pure passion than any victory ever could.
