As I watched my 120lb furry friend struggle down the stairs in 2020, I was reminded of the importance of injury care and assisted mobility - not just for pets, but for athletes too. After a sports injury, a speedy recovery is crucial. Just like my dog needed help navigating the stairs, injured athletes need support to regain their strength and mobility. With the right care and rehabilitation, they can get back in the game. For pet owners and athletes alike, safety and patience are key to a successful recovery.
