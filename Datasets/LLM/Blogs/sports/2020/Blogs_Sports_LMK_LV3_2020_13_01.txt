Scoring an Own Goal: How a Suspicious Voicemail Made Me Rethink My Sports Team Loyalty

As I was getting ready for a morning jog in July 2020, I checked my voicemail and found a message that made my heart skip a beat. A woman claimed to be from Verizon, stating that my number was listed as an alternate on her account. My initial reaction was to dismiss it as a prank call, but something about the message caught my attention. She sounded convincing, and the mention of Verizon, my phone service provider, made me pause.

As I listened to the message again, I started to think about the numerous times I've received suspicious calls or messages claiming to be from my bank or other service providers. It's a common tactic used by scammers to extract personal information from unsuspecting victims. I realized that this voicemail was likely a similar attempt.

The more I thought about it, the more it reminded me of the fierce loyalty I have towards my favorite sports team. Just like how I wouldn't blindly trust a random caller claiming to be from Verizon, I should be just as cautious when it comes to blindly following my team's strategies or defending their every move.

As a die-hard fan, I've often found myself getting defensive when friends or family members criticized my team. But, upon reflection, I realized that this blind loyalty can be detrimental. It's essential to separate my personal identity from the team's performance and make informed decisions based on facts rather than emotions.

The suspicious voicemail served as a wake-up call, making me think about the importance of being vigilant and not taking things at face value. Just as I would verify the authenticity of the caller, I should be willing to question my team's decisions and strategies.

As I continued my jog, I felt a sense of clarity wash over me. Being a loyal fan doesn't mean I have to agree with everything the team does. In fact, having a critical perspective can make me a more informed and engaged fan. The experience taught me that being cautious and vigilant is essential in all aspects of life, whether it's dealing with suspicious voicemails or evaluating my sports team's performance.

As the 2020 sports season progressed, I made a conscious effort to stay informed, question my team's decisions, and maintain a healthy dose of skepticism. And, just like how I would delete a suspicious voicemail, I was willing to reevaluate my loyalty if the team failed to deliver. After all, being a true fan means being true to oneself.
