I'm still fuming about my recent car-buying experience, and it got me thinking about the parallels between negotiating a car loan and playing a tough game of basketball. In 2020, I was excited to purchase a Subaru Outback, having secured pre-approval from Bank of America beforehand. But when I arrived at the dealership, they still insisted on running a credit check. It was like they didn't trust my pre-approval - a slam dunk in my book! I felt like a player being doubted by the coach despite having a strong game plan. Just as a good team works together, I expected the dealership to work with me, not against me. The frustration was palpable. In the end, I walked away, feeling like I'd been fouled. It's a reminder that, just like in sports, sometimes you need to know when to hold 'em and know when to walk away.
