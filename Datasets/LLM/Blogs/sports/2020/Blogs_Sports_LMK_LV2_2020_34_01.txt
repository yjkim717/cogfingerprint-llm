**The Anatomy of Greatness: Unpacking the Top College Football Performances of 2019**

As we stepped into 2020, the sports world was abuzz with excitement and anticipation. The college football landscape was no exception, with fans and analysts alike eagerly awaiting the new season. But as we looked back at the previous year's performances, one thing became clear: 2019 was a standout year for college football. In this post, we're going to take a trip down memory lane and dissect the top 100 game performances of 2019, as ranked by the FEI (Fantasy Efficiency Index) ranking system.

For those unfamiliar with FEI, it's a metric that measures a team's efficiency on both offense and defense, providing a comprehensive picture of their overall performance. By examining the top game performances of 2019 through the lens of FEI, we can gain a deeper understanding of what made those teams tick.

As I dove into the list, I was struck by the sheer dominance of some of the top-ranked teams. The likes of Alabama, Clemson, and Ohio State – perennial powerhouses, to say the least – made multiple appearances in the top 100. But what was more interesting was the presence of some lesser-known teams, who burst onto the scene with impressive performances that left fans and analysts alike taking notice.

One such team was the 2019 Cincinnati Bearcats. With a FEI ranking of 34.6, they stormed onto the scene, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. Their game against UCF on November 29, 2019, was a masterclass in possession efficiency, as they controlled the ball for over 40 minutes and racked up an astonishing 555 total yards. The Bearcats' performance was a testament to the importance of sustained drives and efficient play-calling.

As I continued to scan the list, a few common themes began to emerge. Firstly, the top-performing teams were almost always characterized by their ability to control the tempo of the game. Whether it was through a potent offense or a stifling defense, these teams knew how to dictate the pace and leave their opponents reeling. Take, for example, the Alabama Crimson Tide's game against LSU on November 9, 2019. With a FEI ranking of 42.1, they dominated the Tigers from start to finish, holding the ball for over 37 minutes and limiting LSU to just 276 total yards.

Another key factor that stood out was the importance of game ratings. The top teams were not just efficient; they were also incredibly effective. They knew how to put points on the board and capitalize on their opponents' mistakes. The Clemson Tigers' game against Virginia on November 2, 2019, was a case in point. With a FEI ranking of 38.5, they outscored the Cavaliers 59-10, thanks in large part to their ability to convert third downs and score from anywhere on the field.

As I reflected on the top 100 game performances of 2019, it became clear that there was more to greatness than just raw talent or athleticism. The best teams were those that had honed their skills, perfected their strategy, and executed with precision. They were the teams that had taken the time to develop a deep understanding of the game, and it showed in their performance on the field.

In many ways, the 2019 college football season
