**The Ghosts of the Gym**

It feels weird even writing this, but 2020… it just felt *empty*. I was a huge track guy, practically lived at the high school stadium. Then, everything shut down. Suddenly, the bleachers were ghosts, the starting gun silent. I’d run laps, imagining the roar of the crowd, the taste of victory. Just me, the rain, and a profound sense of loss. It wasn't just about the races; it was about the community, the shared struggle.  It was a stark reminder of how much we take for granted.
