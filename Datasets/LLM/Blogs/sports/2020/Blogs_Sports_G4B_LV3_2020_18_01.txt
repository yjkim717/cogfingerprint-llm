Input: Finding a sports community improves confidence.
Output: Remember 2020? Feeling isolated during lockdowns, I started watching soccer online – just to have something to cheer for.  Then I found a local virtual group.  Sharing my (often terrible) commentary and hearing others’ perspectives built this incredible sense of connection. It wasn't about the game itself, but about being part of a team, even a digital one.  Seriously, finding a shared passion can be a huge confidence booster when you need it most.
