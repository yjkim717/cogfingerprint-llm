## Two Champions? College Football’s Wild 2020 Ride

Man, 2020, right? What a year. It feels like we lived through a movie, and honestly, college football this year played a part in that feeling. I'm still wrapping my head around it, to be honest. We all knew the season would be different, with postponements and bubbles and a whole lot of uncertainty. But I don't think anyone truly prepared for *how* different.

And then came the Fulmer Cup announcement. Two champions? It felt… strange. I mean, shouldn't there be just *one* undisputed king of the gridiron? But when you think about it, Austin Peay and others navigating incredibly challenging circumstances, playing through it all while others had games scrapped – it kind of makes sense. 

It highlighted a truth about 2020: there wasn't a normal way to do anything. It forced us to redefine what "winning" even meant. It wasn’t just about the scoreboard; it was about perseverance, adaptability, and playing your heart out when everything felt up in the air. Maybe having two Fulmer Cup winners reflects that perfectly. It’s a bit quirky, a bit unconventional, but undeniably *2020*.
