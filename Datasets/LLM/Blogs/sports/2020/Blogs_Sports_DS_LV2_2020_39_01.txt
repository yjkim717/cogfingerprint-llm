Of course, here is a reflective blog post about sports in 2020.

The silence was the strangest part. In 2020, my sanctuary—the local community pool—was closed. The familiar scent of chlorine was replaced by sterile air, and the roar of a race was swapped for the quiet hum of my own thoughts. My identity as a competitive swimmer felt suspended, like a race paused mid-stroke.

At first, it was a loss. But that stillness forced a different kind of training. I started running alone, just me and the pavement. I’d focus on my breath, the rhythm of my feet, the simple act of moving forward. I wasn't racing anyone; I was just proving to myself I still could.

When the pools finally reopened, something had shifted. The water felt the same, but I was different. The drive was less about beating the clock and more about the pure, personal joy of the sport. 2020 didn't take my passion; it stripped away the noise and returned it to me, refined. It taught me that sometimes, you have to lose the race to remember why you love to swim.
