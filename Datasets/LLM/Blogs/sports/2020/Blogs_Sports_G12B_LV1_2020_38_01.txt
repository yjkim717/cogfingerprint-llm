## The Week 5 Shuffle: When Rankings Felt...Different

It's funny the things that stick with you. I was scrolling through some old sports stuff the other day – mostly just trying to avoid doomscrolling about the world – and stumbled across a Week 5 NFL power rankings table from 2020. Just a simple spreadsheet, really, averaging out the opinions of ESPN, CBS, and 538. But it sparked a memory, a feeling I hadn't really articulated in years.

2020. Man, what a year. The pandemic was still raging, the election was looming, and everything felt…uncertain. And somehow, obsessively checking NFL power rankings felt like a tiny, manageable escape.  It was a small, predictable corner of a world that felt increasingly chaotic.

Looking back at that Week 5 table, the teams listed seem almost quaint now. The Steelers were high, the Browns were surprisingly solid, and the Giants… well, they were doing *something* that made analysts cautiously optimistic. It wasn't about the wins and losses as much as it was about the *potential*.  We were all clinging to narratives, desperately trying to make sense of a season starting under such bizarre circumstances.

I remember arguing with friends about the validity of 538's model, questioning ESPN’s tendency to overreact to a single game, and feeling smug whenever CBS seemed to “get” a team better than the others. It was silly, really. But it was *our* silly.  It was a shared ritual, a way to connect with people during a time when connection felt fragile.

What struck me most revisiting those rankings wasn't the placement of any particular team. It was the collective hope, the almost frantic desire to impose order on a season that felt destined to be anything but.  We were searching for patterns, for stability, in a league – and a world – that was constantly shifting.

It makes me wonder if we’ll ever feel that same level of… earnestness about sports again. Maybe the pandemic changed something fundamental. Or maybe it was just the specific context of 2020, a year that demanded we find solace wherever we could.
