## The Empty Stands and the Unexpected Lesson

Remember March 2020? The world just… stopped. Suddenly, sports were gone. My college basketball team, poised for a potential NCAA run, was sidelined. It felt surreal, watching the news about lockdowns and uncertainty while simultaneously mourning the loss of Friday night games.

It wasn't just about the games, though. It was about the community, the shared experience, the electric energy of the crowd. The absence was deafening. And it got me thinking about what fuels those moments. A lot of it, frankly, comes down to support – financial support.

Our department relied heavily on donations, the kind of thing that keeps programs running and allows athletes to thrive. And then, the CARES Act came along. I remember a lot of conversations swirling around how the enhanced charitable deduction would impact giving. It felt like a complicated puzzle, trying to understand how it all worked, how it might help.

Honestly, the whole situation – the pandemic, the disrupted sports season, the tax complexities – it showed me a new perspective. It highlighted the vital role of generosity, not just in athletics, but everywhere. And it reminded me that even when the stadiums are empty, the spirit of community and support, in whatever form it takes, is what truly matters. Maybe a little extra tax deduction wasn’t a bad thing, if it helped keep the game going, even in strange times.
