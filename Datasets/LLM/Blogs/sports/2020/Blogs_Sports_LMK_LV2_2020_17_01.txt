"Finding Solace in Sports during Lockdown (2020)"

As the world came to a halt in 2020, I found myself stuck at home, feeling restless and disconnected from the world outside. But, as I laced up my running shoes and hit the empty streets, I discovered a newfound sense of freedom. The lockdown had taken away my team sports and gym sessions, but it couldn't take away my love for running. In fact, it gave me the opportunity to reconnect with it. As I pounded the pavement, the rhythm of my footsteps became a meditation, clearing my mind and soothing my worries. I realized that sports aren't just about competition or fitness; they're about resilience, community, and finding joy in the journey. As I ran, I felt a sense of normalcy and hope, reminding me that even in the darkest times, there's always a way forward.
