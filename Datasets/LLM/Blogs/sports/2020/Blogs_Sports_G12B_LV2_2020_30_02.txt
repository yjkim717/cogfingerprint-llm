## The Curious Case of the 2020 Jazz and Winning Records

It’s been a strange NBA season, hasn't it? The Jazz are showing real improvement overall, which is fantastic to see. But there’s this frustrating pattern emerging – they seem to falter when facing teams actually *good* this year. It’s almost like a mirror reflecting the struggles of the Pelicans and Raptors. Makes you wonder, right? Is it adjustments, chemistry, or just the sheer challenge of competing with the league's elite? It's a reminder that progress isn't always linear, and even good teams face tough hurdles.
