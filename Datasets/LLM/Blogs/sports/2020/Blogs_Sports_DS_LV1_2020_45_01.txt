Rewatching that 2020 first-round series between Dallas and the Clippers, I’m struck by a single question: what makes a player truly "better"?

On one hand, you had Luka Doncic, a whirlwind of offensive creation. His stat lines were video game numbers, the kind that dominate headlines. But then there was Kawhi Leonard, the quiet assassin. His true shooting percentage was ruthlessly efficient, a model of cold, consistent execution night after night.

Luka’s brilliance was a spectacular firework; Kawhi’s was the steady, reliable sun that wins series. It’s a classic debate: the flashy genius versus the proven, unshakeable force. In 2020, the latter ultimately advanced, a reminder that in the playoffs, relentless consistency often outshines even the most dazzling individual performances.
