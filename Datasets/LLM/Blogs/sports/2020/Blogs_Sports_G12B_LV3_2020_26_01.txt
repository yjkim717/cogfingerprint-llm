## The Empty Stands and the Shifting Game

Remember 2020? Everything feltâ€¦uncertain. Even watching my favorite team felt different. The roar of the crowd was gone, replaced by an eerie silence in the empty stadiums. It wasn't just the lack of atmosphere; it felt symbolic. Like so much else that year, the familiar rhythm of the game was disrupted, mirroring anxieties about supply chains, unexpected closures, and the lingering shadow of COVID. It made you appreciate the simple joy of being *there*, with everyone else, sharing the highs and lows.
