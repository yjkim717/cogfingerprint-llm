### The Poll Voter in My Head

You know that little voice in your head that second-guesses every decision? In 2020, mine had a strange new hobby: impersonating an AP Poll voter.

It started in September. With the season hanging by a thread, every preseason ranking felt like a wild guess. My personal top 25 was a mess of nostalgia and hope. But as those first shaky games got played, something shifted. That chaotic inner voter began to calm down.

Week by week, my own rankings started to look less like a personal manifesto and more like… the actual poll. It wasn’t about losing my voice; it was about finding a shared language. The data on the field—the stunning upsets, the heartbreaking losses—was a reality we were all witnessing together. My stubborn opinions were being sanded down by the relentless truth of the scoreboard.

In a year of so much division, there was a strange comfort in this convergence. It was a small, silent consensus built not on argument, but on the undeniable facts of a completed pass or a goal-line stand. My inner voter and the collective “we” were finally seeing the same game.
