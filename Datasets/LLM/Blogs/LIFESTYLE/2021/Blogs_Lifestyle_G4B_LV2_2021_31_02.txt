**Freezing My Way to Control (and a Little Peace of Mind)**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a whirlwind. My diabetes was…well, let’s just say it wasn’t cooperating. The constant worry about blood sugar was exhausting. Then I stumbled upon the magic of meal prepping and freezer meals.

It’s not a cure, but it's given me a sense of control and a little bit of peace. What’s your go-to strategy for managing life's curveballs?
