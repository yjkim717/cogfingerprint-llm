**Finding My Tribe: Roommate Hunting at UF in 2021**

Okay, let’s be real – moving into college housing felt *huge*. Like, genuinely a life-shift. And part of that shift was figuring out who I’d be sharing my space with. This fall, I was a UF student desperately searching for roommates, scouring Facebook groups and stressing over every preference listed. 

I’d spent so long imagining my ideal college life – late-night study sessions, impromptu pizza nights, and a generally chill vibe. But I realized that "ideal" wasn’t just about *me*. It was about finding people who could build a comfortable, supportive space together. 

Ultimately, I found my people, and it reminded me that building a good roommate situation is about more than just finding someone who likes the same TV shows. It’s about finding your tribe.
