**Finding My Life Again**

It feels a little strange admitting this, but 2021 was… messy. I was caught in a cycle – a pull towards things that numbed, things that stole my time and energy. Cocaine, and honestly, a surprising amount of online pornography, had taken hold. It wasn’t about the highs, it was about desperately trying to avoid feeling *anything* at all. 

But then, something shifted. Recognizing I was losing myself, truly losing my life, was the first step. The journey to quit was brutal, but the reward? Slowly, painstakingly, I'm rebuilding. It's not about erasing the past, but about actively choosing a different future – one rooted in genuine personal growth and a life I actually want to live.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps add a specific detail or adjust the tone?
