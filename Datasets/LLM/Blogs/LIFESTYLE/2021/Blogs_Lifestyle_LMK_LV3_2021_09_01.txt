As I look back on 2021, I'm struck by the rise of plant-based eating and fermenting. These trends resonated with me, as I've always been drawn to vibrant, vegetable-centred meals. Incorporating global ingredients like Korean chili flakes and Indian spices added a new layer of depth to my cooking. For me, it's not just about following trends, but about embracing a lifestyle that nourishes both body and soul.
