>## Rewatching Comfort TV and Feeling…Different

Okay, confession time. I’ve been rewatching "How I Met Your Mother." It’s pure comfort viewing, right? The jokes, the familiar faces, the predictable plotlines… But something’s been off. Barney Stinson, once a hilarious rogue, now just feels…uncomfortable. 

It's strange, isn't it? How our perspectives shift. What we found funny in 2007 feels distinctly different in 2021. I’m noticing the pervasive sexism woven into the humor, and it's jarring. It makes me wonder how much our tolerance for certain narratives has changed, and how we process the things we used to just accept as "just a show." Anyone else feeling this with their favorite rewatches?
