Okay, here's a reflective blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational, relatable tone and set in 2021. I've tried to weave in a personal touch and a bit of storytelling.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: Finding Comfort (and Crunch!) in a Changing Kitchen**

It feels like 2021 has been a year of unexpected shifts, hasn’t it? And that’s definitely trickled into my cooking. I’ve found myself craving simplicity, but also a real vibrancy. Lately, I've been obsessed with vegetable-centred meals – big bowls piled high with roasted veggies, often featuring a surprising ingredient like fennel or coriander.

There’s something so grounding about the process of pickling and fermenting, too. It’s almost meditative. My grandma used to make the most incredible pickled beets, and I’m trying to recapture that feeling of cozy tradition. And honestly, a little kick of gochujang never hurts! What food trends have you been leaning into lately? I'd love to hear!
