As I was fine-tuning my Voron 2.4 3D printer in 2021, I stumbled upon a crucial question while performing Pressure Advance Tuning in Klipper: should the speed used for this calibration match my typical high printing speeds? I realized that I had been following the standard procedure without giving it much thought, using the default speed without considering its impact on my prints. Upon further research, I discovered that using a speed that matches my actual printing conditions could make a significant difference in the quality of my prints. This got me thinking - how often do we go through the motions in other areas of our lives without questioning the status quo? I started to reflect on my daily routine and realized that I'm not alone in this. We often follow established norms without considering whether they're still serving us. It's time to challenge our assumptions and optimize our lives, just like I did with my 3D printer.
