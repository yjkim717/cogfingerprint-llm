It’s funny how small frustrations can really stick with you. Last year, I was wrestling with my Katana 50MK2 – specifically, the maddening habit of only being able to switch channels with the ‘b’ button.

It made me think about how easily we get fixated on the details, losing sight of the bigger picture of just wanting to make music.
