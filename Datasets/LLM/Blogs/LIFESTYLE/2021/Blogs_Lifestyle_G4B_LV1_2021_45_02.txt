**The Great Money Talk of '21**

Remember 2021? It felt like *everyone* was suddenly thinking about money. My husband and I were definitely in that boat. We’d been coasting on separate accounts, but realized it wasn’t really working for our shared future. We started seriously talking about a joint credit card – a way to build credit together and really tackle our budgeting. 

It wasn’t always easy, especially when it came to marital finances! But having those open conversations, and actually planning together, made a huge difference.  It’s still a work in progress, but it’s definitely a step towards a more secure and united financial path.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
