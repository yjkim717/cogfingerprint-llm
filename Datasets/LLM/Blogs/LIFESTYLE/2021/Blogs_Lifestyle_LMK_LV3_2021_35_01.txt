As I upgraded my home media hub with a QNAP TS-453Be NAS, I realized my storage needs were about to outgrow the existing setup. Adding a TR-004 expansion unit was the solution, but it raised questions about reconfiguring my RAID 5 setup. I learned that expanding storage isn't just about adding space, it's about maintaining data integrity. This journey taught me to plan for the future, embracing the flexibility that technology offers, and to always be prepared for the next upgrade, just like how we adapt to new experiences in life.
