**The Unexpected Luxury of a Little Upgrade**

It’s funny how small gestures can feel huge, isn’t it? Last year, my dad was flying back from a long trip to Asia – a truly epic adventure. He’d booked a United international flight, and I was suddenly consumed with worry about his comfort. He’d snagged a “L” fare class, which, let’s be honest, isn’t exactly first class. 

So, I spent a frantic afternoon navigating the United portal, desperately trying to see if a flight upgrade was possible.  It wasn't about extravagance; it was about making his journey a little smoother, a little more pleasant.  That tiny upgrade felt like a big hug, and reminded me that sometimes, the best travel moments aren't about the destination, but the thoughtfulness behind the journey.
