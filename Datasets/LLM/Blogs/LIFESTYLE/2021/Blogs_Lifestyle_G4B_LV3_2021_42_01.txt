**The Great Snow Panic of ‘21**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of little anxieties, and then *this* happened. A dusting of snow – really, just a dusting – and suddenly the retail landscape transformed into a chaotic scene. I watched shoppers, faces etched with a strange panic, grabbing every last bag of chips and bread. It was bewildering. 

It made me think about how easily we jump to extremes, fueled by a little uncertainty. A reminder that sometimes, a bit of calm perspective is exactly what we need, even when the snow is falling.
