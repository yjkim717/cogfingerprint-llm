### The Ghost in the Machine: A 2021 Wake-Up Call

It started subtly in 2021. My PC, my trusty portal to the world during those long, quiet days, began to develop a strange quirk. I’d put it to sleep, but later, I’d find it had woken itself up. The tower’s lights would be on, a silent vigil, but the screen was dark, the keyboard lifeless. It was a ghost in the machine—awake, but not truly present.

It felt like a metaphor for my own life back then. I was going through the motions, technically "on," but my own peripherals—my creativity, my motivation—were unresponsive. The only solution for the computer was a hard reset, that jarring hold of the power button.

I realized I needed the digital equivalent. I started taking real lunch breaks away from my desk and going for walks without my phone. It was my own system reboot. Sometimes, to wake up properly, you first have to consciously shut everything down. My computer wasn’t just malfunctioning; it was teaching me a lesson about mindful disconnection.
