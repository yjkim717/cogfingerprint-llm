As I binge-watched the latest thriller TV shows on Netflix in 2021, I couldn't help but think about how tech-inspired crime dramas like 'Searching' and 'Unfriended: Dark Web' reflect our modern lifestyle. These shows tap into our fears of the digital world, making us question our online presence. It's a reminder that our lives are increasingly intertwined with technology, and it's up to us to navigate this blurred line between reality and the virtual world.
