### The Sobering View from the Passenger Seat

It was 2 AM in a cramped rideshare, the air thick with the smell of cheap beer and regret. My friend, slumped against the window, was mumbling something about a karaoke disaster. As the designated driver for the night—a role I’d taken on more and more in 2021—I had a front-row seat to the chaos.

And honestly? I was over it.

Watching the scene unfold from my sober perspective, I started questioning the whole ritual. Was the fleeting "fun" of those extra shots worth the next morning's misery, the cringe-worthy texts, and the vulnerability? My social circle had always equated a good time with a high ABV, but the hangovers were starting to feel less physical and more… existential.

I’m not here to preach teetotaling. But that night, I realized my tolerance wasn’t for alcohol, but for the performative aspect of social drinking. The pressure to keep up, to be the "fun" one, felt exhausting.

Now, I still go out. But I’m choosing connection over consumption. The real laughs happen in the quiet moments between the noise, and I’d rather be fully present for them. Sometimes, the most liberating buzz comes from knowing you’ll remember every single moment—and that your dignity is still intact.
