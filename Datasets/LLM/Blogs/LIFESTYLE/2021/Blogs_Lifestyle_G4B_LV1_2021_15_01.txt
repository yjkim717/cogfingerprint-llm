**The Quiet Kid in the Loud Crowd**

Okay, so 2021. It felt like everyone was trying to *do* something – new music, new hobbies, new…everything. And I was desperately trying to *fit in* at my new sixth form. It wasn’t a bad school, not at all, but stepping into a completely new environment was…intense. 

I’d moved from a tiny village where everyone knew everyone, and suddenly I was surrounded by these established friendship groups. They were already solid, already buzzing with inside jokes and shared experiences. I was the new kid, the ‘outsider,’ and honestly, it hit me harder than I expected. 

The thing is, I’m pretty introverted by nature. I don’t thrive in the middle of a huge crowd, and the way things worked at my old school – small and familiar – just wasn’t translating. I started noticing a real anxiety creeping in, a tightness in my chest every time I walked into the dining hall. 

It wasn’t just the obvious stuff, like feeling like I didn't belong. It was the little things – the quick glances, the snippets of conversations I wasn’t part of. I started pulling away, spending more time in the library, which, ironically, just made me feel more isolated. 

Looking back, I realize I was so focused on *joining* a group that I forgot to just *be*. I was trying to be someone I wasn't, desperately seeking validation from people who didn't even know my name. It’s a pretty humbling lesson, and one I’m still working on.  It’s okay to be a quiet kid in a loud crowd, you know?
