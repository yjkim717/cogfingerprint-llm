## The Fireworks Felt Different This Year

Remember those massive fireworks displays we all used to rush to? Last New Year's, I almost didn't even *see* them. I was too busy trying to get the “perfect” video for Instagram. It felt…flat. This year, I tucked my phone away. Just watched. Really watched. The colors, the boom, the sheer joy on people’s faces. It was breathtaking.  It reminded me: life isn't about documenting every moment, it's about *being* in them. Maybe we all need a little less screen time and a lot more presence.
