It was supposed to be simple. In early 2021, I decided to finally get my financial health in order, and my new HSA felt like a win. I was being proactive, you know? Then came the first red flag: a deposit from my employer that didn’t match our agreement. I shrugged it off, assuming payroll would sort it out.

Months later, my W-2 arrived. My stomach dropped. The mistake was still there, immortalized in an official document headed straight to the IRS. Suddenly, my quest for wellness was a frantic scramble to avoid penalties. My evenings were spent on hold, navigating a maze of HR and benefits departments, my heart pounding with every call.

It was a stark lesson in vigilance. You trust the system until you learn you’re your own best—and sometimes only—advocate. That tax document wasn’t just a form; it was a reminder to never be a passive participant in my own life.
