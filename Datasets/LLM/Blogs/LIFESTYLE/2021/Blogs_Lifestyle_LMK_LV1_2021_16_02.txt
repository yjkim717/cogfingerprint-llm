Upgrading to a high-end guitar can be a tantalizing prospect for musicians. As I pondered my own upgrade in 2021, I couldn't help but wonder: is the hefty price tag justified? Does a $2,000 guitar sound twice as good as a $1,000 one? For me, the answer lies not just in tone, but in the lifestyle it represents - a commitment to craft and a passion that transcends mere price.
