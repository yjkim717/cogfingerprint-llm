Looking back on my freshman year in 2021, I realize I saved money by commuting, but at what cost? While my dorming friends were bonding over late-night pizza and spontaneous adventures, I was stuck in traffic. I missed out on forming those tight-knit college friendships and the vibrant campus social life that happens after class ends. Sure, my wallet was happier, but my social circle paid the price. If I could do it over, Iâ€™d trade some savings for those irreplaceable memories.
