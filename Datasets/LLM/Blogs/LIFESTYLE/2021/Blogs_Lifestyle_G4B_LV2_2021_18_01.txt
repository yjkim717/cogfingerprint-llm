**The Echoes of "What If?"**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How certain moments, seemingly small at the time, can just…stick. They become these little echoes in your mind, bouncing around whenever you least expect it. Lately, I’ve been battling a particularly persistent echo – the one centered around “what if?” 

2021 felt like a year of wrestling with regret. Not the dramatic, life-altering kind, but the quiet, insidious stuff. Regret over missed opportunities, over conversations not had, over choices made that now feel…well, less than ideal. It’s intertwined with this heavy blanket of depression, fueled by a relentless inner critic. 

I find myself constantly measuring myself against others – a dad trying to be *good enough*, a husband trying to be *present*, and a career that feels more like a struggle than a stride forward.  There's a constant pull to compare, and it always leaves me feeling…short. 

Honestly, a lot of it stems from past family issues that I haven't fully processed, and the way they’ve shaped my perspective.  It's a messy tangle, to be sure. 

I’m learning, slowly, that dwelling on the "what ifs" doesn’t change a thing. It just keeps me stuck in a loop of self-criticism.  Right now, I’m focusing on small, actionable steps – being truly present with my family, acknowledging my wins (even the tiny ones), and trying to silence that relentless voice telling me I’m not measuring up. 

It’s a process, definitely. But maybe, just maybe, letting go of those echoes will bring a little more peace.
