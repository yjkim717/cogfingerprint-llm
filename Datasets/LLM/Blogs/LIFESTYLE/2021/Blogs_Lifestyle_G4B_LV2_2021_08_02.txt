**A Weekend of Wonder (and a Very Tired Pup)**

2021 felt like a year of little escapes, didn’t it? This past Monday, I found myself scrambling – desperately seeking a dog sitter for Gus while I dashed off to Santa Fe to check out Meow Wolf. It’s silly, but the thought of leaving him alone for a whole afternoon felt… huge. 

Thankfully, a fantastic dog walker stepped in. Now, Gus is a happy boy, but a *sleepy* boy. He’s currently sprawled out, dreaming of squirrels and belly rubs. It reminded me that sometimes, the best adventures are the ones that allow us to prioritize the people – and furry friends – we love most.
