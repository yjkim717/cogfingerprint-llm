## The Ghosts in the Machine and the Comfort of Familiarity

It’s 2021, and I've been down a serious nostalgia rabbit hole lately. Specifically, trying to get Rainbow Six Vegas 1 and 2’s multiplayer working. Seriously, Ubisoft, what's the deal? It’s frustrating, battling connection issues with games I spent countless hours on as a teenager. It's a reminder of how fleeting online communities can be.

It got me thinking about nostalgia in general. It’s not just about the games, is it? It’s about a time when things felt… simpler. Less frantic. A craving for that comfort. I’ve been dusting off old photo albums and re-reading favourite books, trying to recapture that feeling. Maybe it's a reaction to the constant churn of modern life, the relentless updates and changes. Maybe, just maybe, clinging to the familiar is a perfectly reasonable way to navigate a world that feels increasingly unstable.



Hopefully I can get back online with those terrorists soon, though!
