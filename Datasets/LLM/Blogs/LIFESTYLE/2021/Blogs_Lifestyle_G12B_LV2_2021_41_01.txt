## Remember the Sparkle?

It's funny, isn't it? Last summer, at that amazing fireworks display, I spent more time fiddling with my phone than actually *watching* the show. Capturing the perfect Instagram story felt more important than the booming colors and collective gasp of the crowd. We're all guilty of it, I think – chasing the digital memory instead of living the moment. Lately, I’ve been trying to shift that. Putting the phone down at concerts, savoring dinners… just *being*. It’s a quieter joy, but a richer one. What about you?
