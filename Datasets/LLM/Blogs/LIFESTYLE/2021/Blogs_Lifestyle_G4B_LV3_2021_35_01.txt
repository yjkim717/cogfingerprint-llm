**Building My Digital Memory Palace**

It’s funny how we start collecting things – not just physical objects, but memories too. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with building a more robust “memory palace” for all the family videos and photos. My QNAP NAS is the cornerstone, and I’m seriously considering a TR-004 expansion to give it a real boost.  It’s about more than just storage, really. It’s about safeguarding those precious moments, knowing they’ll be accessible – even if I need to expand later with more drives.  It reminds me of the importance of preserving our stories, don’t you think? #NAS #Plex #StorageSolutions 2021
