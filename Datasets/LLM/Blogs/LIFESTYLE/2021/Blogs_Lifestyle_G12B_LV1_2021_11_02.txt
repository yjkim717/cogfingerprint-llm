## Trading Cables for Clouds: A Mid-Career Pivot & the Fear of the Unknown

It's funny, isn't it? How life throws curveballs when you least expect them. For years, I was comfortable. A solid network engineer, troubleshooting cabling issues and chasing down latency problems. I knew my stuff. But 2021 felt…different. The shift to cloud was undeniable, and I felt this creeping sense of being left behind.

I started looking at AWS, specifically the Network Specialist role. It sounded fascinating, a whole new world of virtual networks and security groups. But the learning curve? Steep. Really steep. I signed up for an ACloudGuru subscription, hoping it would be my lifeline. It’s good, don’t get me wrong, but the sheer volume of information is overwhelming.

Honestly, the biggest hurdle isn’t the technology itself, it’s the fear. The fear of failing, of investing time and energy into something that might not pan out. It’s a strange feeling, being a “beginner” again after so many years of expertise. 

But then I remember why I started this journey. It’s not just about a new job title; it’s about staying relevant, about embracing change, and about proving to myself that I can still learn and adapt.  Wish me luck – I’ve got a lot of studying to do!
