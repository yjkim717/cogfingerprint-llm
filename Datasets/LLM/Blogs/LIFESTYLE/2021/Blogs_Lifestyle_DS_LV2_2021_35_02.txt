It’s 2021, and I’m still chasing that sweet spot—not just in MLB The Show’s franchise mode, but in life. Tweaking sliders, aiming for perfect contact, yet hits don’t always come. It’s like my morning routine: veteran-level effort, but some days just don’t connect. Maybe the secret isn’t in the settings, but in stepping back, breathing, and trusting the process. After all, life’s averages balance out with patience.
