"Embracing Change: My Journey with CPAP and Beard Bliss

As I navigated the challenges of sleep apnea in 2021, I found myself at a crossroads. My trusty ResMed AirSense 10 CPAP machine was a game-changer, but I struggled to find a mask that worked with my beloved beard. I'm a mouth breather, too, which made things even trickier. After trying various masks, I discovered that some models are more beard-friendly than others. I learned to prioritize comfort and seal quality, rather than sacrificing my signature look. If you're in a similar situation, take it from me: there are CPAP mask options out there that can accommodate your unique needs. Don't be afraid to explore and find what works best for you â€“ a good night's sleep and a well-groomed beard are worth it!"
