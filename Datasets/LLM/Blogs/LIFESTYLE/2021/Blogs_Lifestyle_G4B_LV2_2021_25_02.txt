**The Loop of Frustration**

Anyone else feel that particular kind of stuck lately? I was completely immersed in *Savage Planet* last month, really digging the cooperative play – it’s such a nice change of pace. Then, bam – a frustrating bug blocked me from even *starting* Sychi’s trial after a tough attempt. It felt like a game reset, a frustrating rewind. 

It made me think about how easily we get caught in loops of trying to ‘fix’ things, chasing a perfect outcome. Sometimes, stepping back and acknowledging the glitch – the inevitable frustration – is the only way forward.  Anyone else have a recent “Sychi’s trial” moment?
