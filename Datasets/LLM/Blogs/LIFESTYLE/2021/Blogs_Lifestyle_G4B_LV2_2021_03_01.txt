**Chasing Ghosts on the Continental Divide**

2021 felt… restless, didn’t it? Like everyone was trying to shake off the dust of a strange year. Me? I was staring down the barrel of a truly wild idea: a solo ultralight trek on the CDT. It wasn’t about conquering a trail, really, but about confronting a little ghost of my own – the fear of being utterly alone. 

I’ve always loved the pull of solitude, but this felt different.  I spent months meticulously crafting a gear list, obsessing over every ounce, fueled by the image of a minimalist existence.  A bear canister felt less like a safety measure and more like a tiny, metal shield against the unknown.  

Honestly, the biggest challenge wasn’t the miles, it was the quiet.  But maybe, just maybe, pushing into that quiet will help me find a little more peace, both on the trail and back home.  Wish me luck!

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps create a different version with a slightly altered focus?
