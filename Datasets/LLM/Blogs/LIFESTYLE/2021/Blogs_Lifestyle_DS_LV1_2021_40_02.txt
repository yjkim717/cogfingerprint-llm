Looking back on 2021, I remember feeling stuck in a cycle of scrolling and self-soothing that left me more drained than before. That’s when I stumbled upon the NoFap community and its different paths: Easy, Hard, and Monk Mode.

At first, I thought it was all about quitting forever—but I was wrong. The real goal was breaking free from compulsive porn use, not denying natural urges entirely. It wasn’t about punishment; it was about reclaiming control. Choosing “Easy Mode” allowed me to focus on recovery without the pressure of perfection.

That shift in perspective—from shame to self-awareness—was a game-changer. It taught me that healing isn’t an all-or-nothing battle, but a gradual return to balance.
