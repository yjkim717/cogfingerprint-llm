## The Great Milk and Bread Frenzy of '21

Okay, folks, let’s talk about something truly bizarre that happened just last week. We had a *snow* forecast. Seriously, a dusting. Maybe an inch, tops. And suddenly, the world went a little… sideways. 

I work in retail, and let me tell you, the *panic buying* was legendary. Shelves stripped bare of bread and milk. Like, *all* the bread and milk. People were practically wrestling over the last gallon. It was honestly surreal.

It got me thinking, though. Why do we do this? Why do a few flakes of *snow* trigger such an extreme reaction? Is it a deeply ingrained survival instinct? A desire to feel prepared, even when the threat is minimal? Or just… habit? 

2021 has been a year of unprecedented anxieties, and maybe this was just another manifestation of that. A tiny, manageable worry ballooned into a full-blown shopping spree. 

It was a good reminder that sometimes, we're all a little irrational. And that maybe, just maybe, we don’t *really* need six loaves of sourdough to weather a light snowfall. Anyone else witness this madness? Let me know in the comments!
