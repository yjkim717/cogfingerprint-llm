**Operation Kitchen Rescue: It’s Not Just Stuff**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 was *the* year for impulse buys, right? Suddenly, we were all baking sourdough, meal prepping like crazy, and hoarding toilet paper. My kitchen became a monument to pandemic storage, a chaotic landscape of extra jars and forgotten gadgets. 

But the real problem wasn't the stuff itself; it was the family resistance. “I might need that!” became a common refrain. It was slowly driving me nuts! 

Recently, I’ve started tackling it, one drawer at a time, and surprisingly, it’s eased the tension.  It’s less about decluttering and more about creating a space we *all* feel good in.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, a little organization can actually bring a family closer – and maybe save my sanity.
