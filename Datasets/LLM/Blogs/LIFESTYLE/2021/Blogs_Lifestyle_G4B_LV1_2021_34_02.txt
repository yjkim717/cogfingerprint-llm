**The Moment My Momentum Died**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single, frustrating roadblock can suddenly feel like it’s blocking *everything*? Late 2021 was… a lot. I was juggling a new freelance project, trying to keep up with friends scattered across the country, and honestly, just feeling perpetually behind. I was pushing, pushing, pushing, trying to build this momentum, this feeling of being *on* – you know?

Then, my old Volvo started acting up. Simple things, at first – a sluggish pedal response, a weird hesitation when I tried to accelerate. It escalated quickly, and a mechanic finally pointed out a faulty sensor. It wasn’t a dramatic, blown-engine situation, but it felt like a critical system failure. 

It echoed something I was already feeling. I realized I'd been so focused on *doing* – chasing deadlines, networking, saying ‘yes’ to everything – that I’d completely neglected the basics. Like a car needing its glow plugs, I’d let my own energy drain. 

Replacing that sensor felt… surprisingly liberating. It was a small fix, a simple reset. It reminded me that sometimes, you need to address the underlying issues, not just keep applying pressure.  It’s a lesson I’m still carrying into 2022 – a reminder to slow down, check the signals, and make sure I’m actually running smoothly.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or adjusting the length?
