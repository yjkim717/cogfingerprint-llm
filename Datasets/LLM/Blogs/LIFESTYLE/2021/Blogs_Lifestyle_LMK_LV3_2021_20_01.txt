As I watched the 10-hour virtual benefit concert unfold in 2021, I was struck by the power of community and the enduring legacy of a young musician. The event, held to establish a scholarship for music education at Bishop O'Connell High School, was a heartfelt tribute to a talented student violinist who had left an indelible mark on those around her. The fundraiser showcased the beauty of classical music, bringing together artists and audiences from far and wide. It was a poignant reminder that even in a world increasingly dominated by technology, the arts have the ability to transcend borders and touch hearts. As I reflected on the evening's performances, I realized that the true gift of this virtual benefit concert lay not just in the music itself, but in the connections it fostered and the memories it will continue to inspire.
