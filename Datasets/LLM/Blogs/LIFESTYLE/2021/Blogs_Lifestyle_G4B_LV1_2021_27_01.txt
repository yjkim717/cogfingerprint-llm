**Remembering Barney… and Why It Felt Weird**

Okay, real talk. I rewatched *Barney & Friends* last year – a total nostalgia trip, right? But something shifted. It wasn’t the same relentlessly cheerful show I loved as a kid. Barney felt… prickly. And honestly, the whole thing leaned into some pretty uncomfortable territory. It felt like a regression, almost. Maybe it’s just grown-up eyes seeing things differently, but the subtle sexism was hard to ignore. It made me think about how even our favorite childhood memories can hold unexpected shadows.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps explore a different angle (e.g., focusing more on the “regress” aspect)?
