## The Weight of Saturday Nights

It’s 2021, and I'm still trying to figure out the whole "weekend" thing. Specifically, I’m trying to figure out why so many of us seem to think that losing control is a necessary ingredient for a good time.

I've been thinking a lot lately about Saturday nights. Not the fun, sparkly, glowing kind you see in movies. The kind where the air thickens with a strange blend of desperation and bravado. The kind where you're surrounded by people who seem to be actively trying to erase themselves, even for a few hours.

It's not a new observation, I know. We all see it. The slurred words, the unsteady movements, the sudden shifts in mood. But it’s been hitting me harder recently, maybe because I'm just…tired. Tired of the cleanup. Tired of the anxieties that simmer just below the surface of every social gathering. Tired of the unspoken responsibility that falls on the sober people to navigate the chaos.

I remember a few weeks ago, a friend – a really good friend – insisted on buying everyone shots. It wasn't malicious, just…casual. And I felt this sudden wave of exhaustion wash over me. Not from the alcohol, but from the *expectation* of it. The expectation that to truly relax, to truly connect, we need to lower our inhibitions, to blur the edges of ourselves.

Honestly, I’m starting to question that. Is that really what connection looks like? Is the price of a fleeting sense of freedom worth the lingering weight of unease?

I'm not advocating for a life of monastic stillness. I just think we owe it to ourselves, and to each other, to examine what we're chasing on those Saturday nights. Maybe the real escape isn’t in a bottle, but in finding a way to be present, to be vulnerable, and to be genuinely, authentically *ourselves* – even when it's not loud or flashy. Maybe that’s a weekend worth striving for.
