>## The Book Stack & The Waiting List

Okay, real talk. 2021 has been… a lot. And as someone with ADHD, navigating the overwhelm feels amplified. I've been meaning to get back into therapy for a while, but the therapist waitlists are insane, and finding someone who actually takes my insurance? Forget about it. 

So, I've been leaning heavily into self-improvement, specifically through books. It's not a replacement for professional help, obviously, but it’s something. Right now, I’m wading through a stack focusing on executive function and mindfulness. Anyone else finding solace (and practical tips!) in books when life feels a little too chaotic? Recommendations welcome!
