**The Year My Taxes Became a Full-Blown Drama**

Okay, let's be real – 2021 was *rough* for a lot of us, right? Between everything else, my taxes decided to throw a massive curveball. It started with a weird W-2 discrepancy – a small error, but enough to flag a red flag with the IRS. Suddenly, I was fielding calls and scrambling to correct a deposit my employer had made. 

It felt incredibly stressful, like a tiny, persistent worry nagging at the back of my mind. The thought of an IRS audit was terrifying! Thankfully, we got it sorted with a tax amendment, but it really made me think about the importance of being organized and trusting that your employer is getting things right. 

It’s a surprisingly humbling experience, realizing how much relies on these seemingly small processes.  Anyone else have a tax-related near-miss?
