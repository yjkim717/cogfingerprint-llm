The joys of working from home in 2021! My PC has become an extension of myself, and I've grown accustomed to putting it to sleep when I'm not using it. But lately, it's been waking up on its own, and I'm not talking about a gentle stir - I'm talking full-on, fan-blasting, lights-shining-bright wakefulness. The weird part? All my peripherals remain asleep, leaving me scratching my head. It's like my PC is trying to tell me something, but I'm not speaking its language. A hard reboot is the only solution, but it's getting old. I've checked for background programs that might be causing the issue, and even given the power button a good cleaning. Still, the problem persists. It's a minor annoyance, but it's got me thinking - when was the last time I took a break from technology? Maybe it's time to unplug and take a digital detox.
