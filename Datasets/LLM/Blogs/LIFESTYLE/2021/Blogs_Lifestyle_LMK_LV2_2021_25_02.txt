As I navigated the glitches in Savage Planet's cooperative mode during Sychi's trial in 2021, I realized that troubleshooting isn't just about fixing game bugs - it's about cultivating patience and persistence in our daily lives. Just as I had to reboot and retry, we often need to restart and reapproach life's challenges. By embracing this mindset, we can transform frustrating moments into opportunities for growth, and emerge stronger, just like overcoming that pesky game bug. It's a lesson that extends far beyond the gaming console, into our everyday lives.
