>## When Life Throws Lemons (and Foot Loss): Finding Comfort in a Freezer Full of Good Food

It’s been a tough year, hasn't it? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how small acts of kindness can ripple outwards. A friend of a friend is facing a truly difficult situation – battling uncontrolled diabetes, dealing with the devastating loss of a foot, and navigating financial strain. It’s heartbreaking. 

We’re brainstorming ways to help, and the conversation kept circling back to food. Simple, nutritious, low-carb meals, ready to go. Meal prepping and freezing has become a lifeline, a way to offer comfort and ease a little bit of the burden. It’s a reminder that even when things feel overwhelming, a warm, healthy meal can make a difference.
