## Melting Boundaries: A Little Bit of Maker Magic

It's funny, isn't it, how hobbies can unexpectedly mirror life? I’ve been obsessed with 3D printing lately, specifically tinkering with the idea of printing with metal – pewter, gold alloys… things I usually only associate with jewelry making. Learning about their melting points and how they *might* work with FDM printers feels… liberating.

Like, if you can coax metal to flow through a plastic extruder, what else can you reshape? It’s a reminder that boundaries are often just perceptions.  We put these limits on ourselves, on what’s possible, and sometimes all it takes is a little experimentation, a little heat, to see things differently. 2021 has been about embracing that, hasn't it? Finding the flow, even when things feel rigid.
