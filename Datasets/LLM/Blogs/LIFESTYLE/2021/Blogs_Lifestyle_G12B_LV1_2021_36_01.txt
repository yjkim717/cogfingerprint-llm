>## The Unexpected Joy of Letting Go (and Choosing Btrfs)

Okay, so this might sound weird, but I’ve been obsessing over filesystems lately. Seriously. It all started with wanting to optimize my Linux Mint install. I dual boot with Windows, but honestly, Windows compatibility wasn’t my top priority. I wanted *speed* and rock-solid data integrity. Enter Btrfs.

It’s been a surprisingly meditative process. Decluttering my digital life feels a bit like decluttering my physical one. Moving files, deciding what’s truly important, archiving the rest… it’s a surprisingly freeing exercise. 

I realize this isn't exactly a typical 2021 self-improvement journey – no Marie Kondo here. But there's something profoundly satisfying about choosing a system that prioritizes resilience and performance, and then dedicating time to actually *organize* within it. It’s a small thing, a technical detail, but it's making me feel more in control and, dare I say, a little more mindful. And that’s a good feeling.
