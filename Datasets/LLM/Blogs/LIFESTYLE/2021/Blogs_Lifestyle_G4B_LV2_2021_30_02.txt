**The Sticky Situation & My Callus Crusade**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 felt like a year of small, persistent battles. Between the endless Zoom meetings and the general anxiety, my feet were definitely taking a beating. I started noticing these little, stubborn warts on my heels, and honestly, they just wouldn’t budge. 

I wasn’t alone, though. I stumbled across a forum where someone was wrestling with the same issue – keeping wart remover pads in place, battling a ridiculous amount of callus, and trying to figure out if their treatment was *actually* working. It resonated so strongly! 

It made me realize how easily we neglect the little things, especially when life gets hectic. My feet were screaming for attention, and I’d just been ignoring them. I started prioritizing basic foot care – gentle exfoliation, moisturizing, and finally, tackling those warts with salicylic acid. 

It’s a slow process, a little messy, and requires daily commitment. But honestly? It’s a surprisingly mindful ritual.  It’s about showing myself a little kindness, one callus and wart at a time.  Anyone else fighting a similar quiet battle?
