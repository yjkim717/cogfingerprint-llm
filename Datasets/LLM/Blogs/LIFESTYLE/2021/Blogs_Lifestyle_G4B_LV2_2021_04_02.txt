**The Silent Plea of a Prayer Plant (and a Little Bit of Me)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we project our own anxieties onto the things we bring into our homes. I definitely learned that lesson this past year, staring down at a particularly wilted prayer plant. 

I’d gotten it on a whim in early 2021, a little burst of green ambition amidst the grey of lockdown. I was trying so hard to create a sense of calm, a little pocket of beauty in a world that felt increasingly chaotic. But this particular plant – let’s call him Silas – wasn’t cooperating. His leaves were drooping, turning a sickly yellow, and he seemed to be permanently folded up, like he was silently judging my plant care skills. 

It felt… symbolic, honestly. Like my own attempts to ‘fix’ things, to control the narrative of the year, were failing. I spent hours researching, obsessing over soil pH and light exposure, convinced I was the culprit. 

Turns out, he just needed a little TLC – a deeper watering, a move to a brighter spot. But the experience really got me thinking about the difference between forcing recovery and allowing for genuine healing. Silas's struggle mirrored my own, a reminder that sometimes, the best thing you can do is simply offer a little patience and let things unfold.
