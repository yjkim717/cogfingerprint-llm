>## My Kitchen, My Reset: Finding Joy in Fermentation (and Vegetables!)

2020 was… a lot. So, as we tiptoed into 2021, I felt a serious need for a reset. Not a drastic overhaul, but a gentle shift towards things that genuinely brought me joy and a sense of groundedness. And for me, that landed squarely in the kitchen.

I've been diving deep into the world of plant-based eating, not in a restrictive way, but with a playful curiosity. Suddenly, vegetables aren’t just a side dish; they’re the *star*. Roasted cauliflower steaks, vibrant salads bursting with color, and even experimenting with vegetable-centered meals I’d never considered before.

But the real revelation has been fermentation. Pickling cucumbers? Check. Making my own sauerkraut? Absolutely! There’s something incredibly satisfying about transforming humble vegetables into tangy, probiotic-rich goodness. It feels like a little act of magic, and honestly, a really delicious one at that. 

What about you? What food trends or kitchen explorations are you embracing in 2021? I'd love to hear!
