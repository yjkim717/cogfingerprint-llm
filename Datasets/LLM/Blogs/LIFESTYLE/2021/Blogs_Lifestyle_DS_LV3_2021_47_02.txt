There’s a reason the myth of the phoenix has echoed through centuries—it’s not just a story; it’s a mirror. I saw my own reflection in its ashes during the strange, suspended year of 2021. The world had slowed down, and for the first time, I couldn’t outrun the quiet voice asking, “Is this really you?”

My life, pre-pandemic, was a masterpiece of busyness. I was juggling a demanding job, a sprawling social calendar, and a relentless stream of notifications. I mistook motion for progress and exhaustion for dedication. But when the world shut down, the noise stopped, and all that was left was the stark reality of my own choices. I was surrounded by what I now call “friendly ghosts”—habits that drained my energy, relationships that cost my peace, and a constant chase for validation that left me hollow. I was living for the ‘likes,’ both online and off, and the person in the mirror was becoming a stranger.

The turning point wasn’t a lightning bolt of inspiration; it was a slow, painful admission of responsibility. I had to own my part in building that life. I had curated the distractions. I had accepted the toxicity. I had chosen the easy path of complaint over the hard path of change. Letting go felt like a sacrifice—and it was. I muted group chats that thrived on drama. I deleted apps that turned my phone into a slot machine. I had difficult conversations and created boundaries that felt selfish at first. It was terrifying. Who would I be without these familiar crutches?

But in that quiet space, something incredible happened. Just like the phoenix, I found that true rebirth requires the courage to be reduced to embers. Shedding those layers wasn’t a loss; it was a liberation. The energy I had been pouring into maintaining a facade was suddenly mine again. I started reading, really reading. I went for walks without a podcast blaring in my ears. I learned to sit with my own thoughts, and for the first time, I didn’t find them lacking.

The growth that followed wasn’t about becoming someone new, but returning to who I was always meant to be—more present, more intentional, and far more alive. The phoenix doesn’t rise in spite of the fire; it rises because of it. And sometimes, the most responsible thing you can do is have the courage to burn.
