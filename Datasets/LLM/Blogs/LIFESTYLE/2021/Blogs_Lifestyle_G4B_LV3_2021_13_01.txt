**Little Paws, Big Worries**

It’s funny how quickly a tiny creature can hijack your entire world. My little Luna, after her spay last spring, started showing a little bump – a tiny, unsettling lump. Suddenly, I was consumed with worry. The vet’s appointment felt like an eternity, and the anxiety was real. 

It’s a stark reminder, isn’t it? How deeply we feel for our pets, how their wellbeing becomes so intertwined with our own peace of mind.  2021 was already a stressful year, and a little kitten’s concern felt like a punch to the gut.  Just hoping for good news and a little reassurance for my sweet girl.
