>## The Weight of Stories, and Finding Myself Within Them

Lately, I've been completely immersed in research for a screenplay – a story about butch lesbians in America. It's a project I'm incredibly passionate about, but honestly, it's been… a lot. I've been reading firsthand accounts, listening to interviews, and the sheer weight of historical trauma is just staggering. We’re talking decades of discrimination, violence, and erasure.

Reading about these experiences, the constant fight for safety and recognition, has stirred something deep within me. As someone who identifies as butch, I’ve always felt a certain pride in that identity. But facing this history head-on, it's brought a wave of complex emotions. A sadness, yes, but also a fierce determination to honor those who came before me.

It’s been a real reckoning. I’m questioning, reflecting, and ultimately, feeling a renewed sense of connection to a legacy I'm only beginning to understand. This project isn't just about telling a story; it's about understanding myself, and the generations of women who paved the way for me to even *be* here, living authentically in 2021.
