>## The Delhi Photo Flood & My Digital Declutter

It's 2021, and I'm feeling… overwhelmed. Specifically, by the Delhi subreddit. It used to be a lovely place to see snippets of life in my city, beautiful shots of the Jama Masjid, bustling markets. Lately, though? It’s just a deluge of the same few photos, reposted constantly. Feels like spam, honestly.

I’ve made a decision – a small one, but it feels significant. I'm going to downvote every photography post for a while. It's not about the photographers themselves, it's about reclaiming a space I used to enjoy. Maybe it's silly, but it's part of a bigger effort to declutter my digital life and focus on what genuinely sparks joy. Sometimes, a few downvotes are a form of self-care.
