It’s 2021, and I’m finally seeing it clearly: recovery isn’t just about quitting pornfap or cocaine. It’s about waking up each morning and actively building the life I used to just dream about. I’m not passively waiting for benefits to appear; I’m creating them. My mind feels sharper, my energy is mine again, and I’m rediscovering real connections. It’s a daily choice, but it’s the one that’s given me my future back.
