"I'm still reeling from the latest 90 Day Fianc√© drama. Libby's family's crimped hair was laughable, but what really got under my skin was Chuck's lack of effort to mediate the chaos. As someone who's navigated their own family conflicts, I know it takes two to tango. Can't they just take a deep breath and communicate? It's 2021, folks - can't we do better? The crimps may be a superficial issue, but the underlying family dynamics are what really need a makeover."
