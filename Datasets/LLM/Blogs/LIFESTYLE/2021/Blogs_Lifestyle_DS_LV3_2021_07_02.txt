The call came while I was stirring oatmeal, the one food my daughter could sometimes keep down. “We can’t refill the domperidone,” her GI doctor said, his tone flat. Just like that, the one medication offering a sliver of normalcy was gone, lost to side effects and a shrug from the very person who should have a plan B.

It was 2021, and in our corner of Western Tennessee, finding a specialist who understood the labyrinth of Gastroparesis felt like searching for a lighthouse in a fog. Our local doctor was kind but out of answers. I spent nights scrolling, my phone glowing in the dark, clinging to phrases like “autonomic clinic” and “motility specialist.” It’s a lonely journey, advocating for your child in a medical maze, where the right turn could lead to hope, and a dead end just leads back to the empty bowl of oatmeal.
