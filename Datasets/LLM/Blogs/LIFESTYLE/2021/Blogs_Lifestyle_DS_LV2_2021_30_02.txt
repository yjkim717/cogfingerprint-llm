### The Two-Week Wart and My Patience Problem

So, I finally did it. After months of side-eyeing a stubborn little wart on my finger, I marched into the pharmacy, grabbed a box of Compound W, and declared war. I had a vision of military precision: daily applications, swift results, victory in a week.

Reality, as it often does, had other plans.

Two weeks in, and my battlefield is a mess. I’m supposed to be the general, but my discipline is failing. I keep forgetting a nightly dose. A weird, white callus has formed, which the instructions call “the treated wart,” but I just see a bizarre, pebbly patch of skin. My pumice stone and I have become reluctant acquaintances, and let’s not even talk about the duct tape phase—my finger looked like it had been in a craft supply accident.

The progress is glacial. In our 2021 world of instant deliveries and next-day results, this slow, stubborn healing is a brutal lesson in patience. It’s a tiny, annoying mirror reflecting back my own rush to fix things. Maybe the real removal isn’t just about the wart, but about scraping away my own unrealistic expectations, one frustrating, slow layer at a time.
