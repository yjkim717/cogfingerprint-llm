## The Worry Knot and a Tiny Warrior

It's funny how quickly your world can shrink. Just last week, I was happily settling into the rhythm of 2021, enjoying the quiet moments and the promise of a (hopefully) brighter year. Now, my focus is entirely on a tiny ball of fluff – my newly adopted kitten, Luna.

She had her spay surgery a few days ago, and while everything seemed fine initially, I’ve noticed some concerning swelling and a small, growing lump. There’s also a touch of redness around the incision. Honestly, it’s created this persistent knot of worry in my stomach. 

You know that feeling, right? When something small throws everything off balance? I’m trying to stay positive, reminding myself that these things happen, and a vet appointment is scheduled. But it’s hard not to feel a surge of protectiveness and a little bit of helplessness. 

It’s a good reminder, though, that even amidst our own personal journeys and goals, sometimes life asks us to simply *be* present, to offer comfort and care to those who need it most. Sending good vibes to Luna – and to anyone else navigating a little worry right now.
