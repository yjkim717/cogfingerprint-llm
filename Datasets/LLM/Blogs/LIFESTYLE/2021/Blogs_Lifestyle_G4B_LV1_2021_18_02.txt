**Reclaiming My Ride: A Vintage Makeover**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a bike can feel like so much more than just a way to get from A to B. This year, 2021, I’ve been wrestling with a bit of a restlessness, a need for something *more* in my daily routine. So, I decided to tackle a project: converting my old, slightly battered mountain bike into something a little… smoother. 

I’m aiming for a gravel bike vibe, swapping out the chunky grips for drop bars, and hoping to trade in some rough trails for a decent 12-mile commute. It’s a slow process, fiddling with shifters and cables, but there's something incredibly satisfying about breathing new life into something old. 

It’s not about speed or impressing anyone; it’s about finding a connection with the road, and a little bit of mindful movement in a world that often feels too fast.
