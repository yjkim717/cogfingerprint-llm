## Finding My Flow (and a Little Less Doomscrolling)

2021 felt… heavy, didn't it? I spent so much time glued to my phone, caught in the news cycle. But lately, I've been making a conscious effort to unplug.

It's a small shift, but it feels like I’m finally resurfacing, finding my own little pocket of calm. Anyone else feeling this?
