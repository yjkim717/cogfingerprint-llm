**The Feeling of Slipping Away**

It’s funny, isn’t it? I’ve been thinking a lot about racing lately – specifically, that initial, frantic feeling of slipping. Like when you first start a new project at work, or even just a really ambitious home improvement task. There’s that initial static friction, that desperate clinging to the starting point, fueled by adrenaline and a little bit of fear. 

But as you push forward, as you *accelerate* and actually start to gain traction, that franticness fades. It’s a surprisingly good metaphor for life, really. Letting go of the initial struggle allows you to move forward, to actually build something solid.  2021 felt a lot like that, honestly.
