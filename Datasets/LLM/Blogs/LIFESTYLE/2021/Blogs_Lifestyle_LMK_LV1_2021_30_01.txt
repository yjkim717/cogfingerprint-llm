As I rewatched the For All Mankind TV season 2 finale in the summer of 2021, a shiver ran down my spine. A seemingly innocuous conversation between Sergei and some military bigwigs caught my attention. It got me thinking - what's next for Margo? Will her storyline take a dramatic turn in S03? The more I thought about it, the more I realized how much I love dissecting the plot twists in my favorite shows. It's become a fun way to unwind after a long day, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for Margo and the rest of the characters.
