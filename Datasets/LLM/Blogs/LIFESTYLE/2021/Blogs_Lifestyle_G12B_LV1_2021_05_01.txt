## The Ghost in the Machine (and My Sleep Schedule)

It's been a weird few weeks, honestly. I’m trying to get back into a decent sleep schedule – you know, the kind where I actually *sleep* through the night and wake up feeling vaguely human. But my computer's been throwing a wrench in things. 

It started subtly. I’d put my rig to sleep, thinking I’d catch a few extra minutes of shut-eye, and then suddenly, *bam*, the PC would spring back to life in the middle of the night. At first, I figured it was a software update, something like that. But now? It’s a nightly occurrence.

The strange part? When it wakes, everything is… frozen. No mouse movement, no keyboard response. Just a glowing screen and the quiet hum of the fans. It’s like a digital ghost has taken over. I’ve been troubleshooting – fiddling with Razer Synapse, checking Nvidia Experience settings, even wondering if it's a driver issue. Nothing seems to stick.

Eventually, I have to resort to a full hard reset. It’s frustrating, disrupts my sleep, and makes me feel like I’m battling a sentient machine. It's a silly problem, really, but in 2021, when so much of our lives are intertwined with tech, even a malfunctioning computer can feel incredibly disruptive to the simplest things, like a good night's rest. Anyone else dealing with similar tech gremlins lately?
