**The Quiet Hum of Home**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple piece of tech can suddenly feel like the heart of a space. Last year, I finally bit the bullet and upgraded my QNAP NAS – a TS-453Be, actually – mostly to wrangle all my movie collection for Plex. Setting up a RAID 5 with a TR-004 expansion unit felt a little daunting, but the result is this constant, reassuring hum. It’s a reminder that all my memories, my family’s photos, and my entertainment are safely tucked away, ready to be enjoyed.  It’s a surprisingly comforting thought.
