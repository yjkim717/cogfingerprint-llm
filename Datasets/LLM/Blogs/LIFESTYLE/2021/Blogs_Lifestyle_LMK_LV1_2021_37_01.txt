As I sit here in 2021, surrounded by the trappings of a life I'm supposed to be proud of - a laptop open to nursing school notes, a journal filled with affirmations, and a daily planner full of healthy habits - I'm hit with a familiar feeling: emptiness. It's like I'm going through the motions, checking all the right boxes, but somehow I'm still detached from it all. I'm 31, in school to start a new career, and trying to cultivate a positive mindset, but the numbness persists. It's disheartening to admit that despite my best efforts, I'm still struggling with depression. Therapy has been a lifeline, helping me untangle the complex emotions that come with feeling so unfulfilled. It's a daily journey, but I'm learning to be kinder to myself and confront the emptiness head-on. Maybe that's the first step towards truly feeling alive.
