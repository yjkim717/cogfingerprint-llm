## Did My House Just Double in Value? Seriously?!

Okay, 2021 has been…a year, right? But nothing quite prepared me for this. We’ve been happily settled in our home, content, and not really thinking about moving. Then, we were casually looking into a refinance – just to see if we could snag a slightly better rate. The appraisal came back, and I nearly choked on my coffee. 

Double. The value had *doubled* since we bought it just a few years ago! It's wild to witness this real estate boom firsthand. Suddenly, the idea of selling and renting, something we’d always dismissed, feels…intriguing. It's a big decision, but the potential to accelerate our path to financial independence is definitely giving us pause. Anyone else experiencing this crazy market?
