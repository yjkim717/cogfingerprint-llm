As I sat down to think about my friend's recent loss, I couldn't help but reflect on the challenges we've all faced since COVID-19 turned our lives upside down. Losing a loved one is never easy, but the pandemic has made it even harder. My ex-friend's dad passed away due to COVID-19, and I wanted to be there for them. I've been thinking about how we can support those around us who are grieving. For me, it's about being present and offering a listening ear. I've also been encouraging my friend to consider therapy sessions - it's amazing how talking to a professional can help process emotions. It's not always easy to know what to say or do, but by being there and showing we care, we can make a difference. Sometimes, that's all someone needs to feel supported and not alone.
