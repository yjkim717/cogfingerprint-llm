**Finding Beauty in the Digital Echoes**

It’s funny how 2021 felt like a year of finding beauty in the unexpected. Remember those endless virtual concerts? I’d always been a live music person, but suddenly, I was tuning into performances from across the globe, just from my couch. It felt a little strange, a digital echo of the real thing, but also…powerful. 

Recently, I read about a virtual benefit concert raising money for a scholarship at Bishop O’Connell HS – a tribute to a student musician who sadly passed away. It really got me thinking about how we can use these new platforms to support things we care about.  

It’s not about replacing the tangible experience, but about finding creative ways to connect and contribute.  Maybe it’s a virtual concert, a small donation, or just spreading the word.  Sometimes, the most meaningful gestures happen in the digital space, carrying the weight of our intentions into the world.
