Of all the words I learned in early sobriety, “community” felt the most abstract. I pictured a vague, smiling crowd. But in 2021, as the world kept pivoting and our collective stamina wore thin, I learned its true, gritty meaning. It’s not just a group of people; it’s the scaffolding that holds you up when your own foundation feels like it’s crumbling.

This lesson crystallized for me in our weekly **Saturday Shares**. For years, it was a beautifully orchestrated event. A different volunteer would step into the spotlight each week, sharing their story—the stumbles, the relapses, the hard-won victories. It was powerful. But then, life started happening. The carefully scheduled volunteers, myself included, began to falter. A work crisis, a family obligation, or just the sheer emotional weight of showing up would lead to a no-show. The empty space on a Saturday morning started to feel less like a scheduling error and more like a quiet echo of the isolation we were all fighting.

I’ll be honest, watching a scheduled share fall through felt like a tiny **relapse** of the spirit for our entire group. It was a reminder that our best intentions could be hijacked by the chaos of modern life. We were trying to force a structure that was no longer serving the very people it was meant to uplift. Our priorities were changing, and our community needed to change with them.

So, we’re shaking things up. Instead of placing the burden on one person each week, we’re moving to a weekly collection—an aggregated tapestry of your voices. You can send in a paragraph, a thought, a song that got you through a tough day. It’s lower pressure, more fluid, and honestly, it feels more real.

Because sobriety, much like life in 2021, isn’t about perfectly timed performances. It’s about showing up as you are, when you can. It’s about knowing the **community** is still there, holding space for you, even if your only contribution that week is a single sentence whispered from the back of the digital room. The format is changing, but the heart of it—the shared, imperfect, beautiful journey—remains stronger than ever.
