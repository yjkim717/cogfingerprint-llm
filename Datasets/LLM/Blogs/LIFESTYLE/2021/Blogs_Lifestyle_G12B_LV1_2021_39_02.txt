>## The Unexpected Calm of Aggie Life

Okay, so picture this: me, fresh out of high school, absolutely *convinced* I was going to explode onto a college campus, instantly become a social butterfly, and ace every single class. UC Davis, here I come! That was the plan in Fall 2021.

The reality? A little… different. 

The dorms were definitely a learning experience – let's just say my roommate and I had very different ideas of "clean." But honestly, the slower pace of Davis started to seep in. It wasn't the wild party school I’d initially envisioned. Instead, it was a place where people actually *studied.* I’m a psych major on the pre-med track, and the academic rigor is real, but there’s this quiet focus that’s surprisingly motivating. 

The food? Let's just say the dining halls have improved immensely since some alumni told me stories! 

It’s been a year of adjusting. Less frantic socializing, more intentional connections. Less pressure to be *on*, more space to just *be*. And honestly, finding that calm in the midst of challenging classes and future-planning? That's been the biggest, and best, surprise of all.
