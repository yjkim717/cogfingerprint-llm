>## Stuck in First Gear

It's funny how little things can throw you off. I finally bit the bullet and got a new foot controller for my Katana 50MK2 amp – excited to finally switch channels mid-song without fumbling! But… it's only working between channel 1A and 1B. Seriously? I’ve spent the last hour troubleshooting, checking manuals, and feeling a bit silly.

It’s a small frustration, but it’s mirroring something bigger, I think. Sometimes, even with new tools and good intentions, we get stuck in a rut, repeating the same patterns. Maybe I need to rethink my approach, reset my "bank," and find a new pathway. Channel 1A is fine, but there’s a whole world of sound out there!
