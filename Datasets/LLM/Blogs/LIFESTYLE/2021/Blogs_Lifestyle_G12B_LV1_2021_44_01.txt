>## The Unexpected Question That Changed My Perspective

Okay, so last week was… weird. I had a virtual tour of a local sustainable packaging facility – part of my ongoing quest to be more eco-conscious. It was fascinating, really, seeing the process from recycled materials to finished product. Then, at the end, the interviewer dropped this curveball: “What’s one small thing you’re doing to reduce your impact?” 

I stammered! Suddenly, my reusable coffee cup felt insufficient. It got me thinking, though. It wasn't about grand gestures, but consistent, small choices. I’m committing to meal prepping more to reduce food waste. Baby steps, right? 2021 is all about those.
