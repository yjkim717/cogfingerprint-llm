**The Nighttime Battle (and My Quest for a Better Mask)**

Okay, let’s be honest – sleep isn't always a blissful, uninterrupted experience. For me, it’s been a bit of a war zone for the last few years. I use a CPAP machine, and while it’s been a game-changer for my health, my *first* nasal mask was… a nightmare. Specifically, the Resmed Airfit N30. It leaked, it was a pain to clean, and let’s just say it didn’t exactly encourage a peaceful slumber.

It got me thinking about how easily we settle into routines, even uncomfortable ones. We stick with things because they’re *familiar*, even if they're actively hindering our well-being.  2021 was a year of small, deliberate shifts for me - trying to be more mindful of my habits. 

Now, I'm on a mission to find the perfect replacement – exploring nasal masks, nasal pillows, even gel masks! It’s a surprisingly personal journey, figuring out what really works for *my* sleep.  Anyone else out there battling the sleep tech struggle?  Let’s share our experiences – maybe we can help each other find a little more peace (and a cleaner mask!) at night.
