**The Streak That Ended**

2021 felt…fragile, honestly. I was chasing a win streak in a ridiculous online shooter – Valorant, if you’re curious – and it went from Platinum 3 to Gold 3 in like, a week.  It was exhilarating at first, then utterly demoralizing.  Then, after a particularly brutal loss, I just stopped.  A single win, a tiny, unexpected victory, snapped me out of it. Maybe it’s about letting go of the “streak” and just appreciating the game, not needing to dominate.  Strange, right?
