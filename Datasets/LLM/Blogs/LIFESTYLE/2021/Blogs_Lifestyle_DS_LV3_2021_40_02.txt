It’s 2021, and I’m scrolling through another late-night feed when I stumble upon NoFap. At first, it sounds like just another internet challenge—a test of willpower. But as someone quietly wrestling with porn’s grip, I decide to give it a shot.

What surprised me wasn’t just resisting urges; it was rediscovering parts of myself I’d numbed. This wasn’t about shaming masturbation, but about breaking a cycle that left me drained. Each day felt like reclaiming a little focus, a bit of energy I’d lost to the screen.

Now, looking back, it wasn’t a perfect journey—but it was a start. A step toward healthier habits, and a reminder that sometimes, the smallest changes lead you back to yourself.
