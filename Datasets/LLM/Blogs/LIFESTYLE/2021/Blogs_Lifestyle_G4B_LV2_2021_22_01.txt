**The Weight of a Pint**

It’s funny how little things can suddenly feel…heavy. Late 2021 found me completely obsessed with Heady Topper. Seriously obsessed. This Vermont craft beer, this hazy, piney, ridiculously sought-after “heady topper” as it’s affectionately called, had become a near-religious experience. 

And then, it hit me. A wave of unexpected guilt. 

I’d been drinking it – *really* drinking it – without a second thought.  I’d snagged a can from a friend’s stash, popped the top, and savored it like it was the last beer on Earth.  But Heady Topper isn’t just a beer; it’s become a symbol, a legend.  The waitlists are insane, the prices astronomical. 

It made me realize I’d been taking so much for granted. That simple pleasure, that perfect taste… it felt almost *wrong* to be enjoying it so casually.  

It’s a weird thing, right?  Feeling responsible for appreciating something rare.  I’m not saying I need to treat every beer with reverence (though, let’s be honest, it’s pretty amazing!), but it did force me to pause and consider the value of experiences – not just the things we *have*, but the moments we *choose* to enjoy. 

What’s one little thing you’ve lately felt a little more aware of?
