It’s 2021, and I’m halfway through my psychology degree at UF, still figuring out this whole “adulting” thing. But one thing I’ve learned? Your living space matters. I’m in a cozy 3/2 at Silver Creek, and with two rooms opening up, I’ve been thinking about what makes a house a home.

It’s not just about affordable rent or being close to campus—though those are huge perks! For me, it’s about balance: quiet evenings to unwind, but also space for laughter and shared hobbies. I’d love to live with fellow women who value that blend, whether we’re swapping stories or just enjoying our own thing nearby. After all, the right roommates don’t just split costs; they make the in-between moments meaningful.
