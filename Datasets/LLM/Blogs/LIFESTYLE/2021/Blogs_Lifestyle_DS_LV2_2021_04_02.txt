### The Prayer Plant and the Art of Letting Go

It’s funny how a plant can hold up a mirror to your life. In the chaotic blur of 2021, my prayer plant became my quiet barometer. Its leaves would rise and fall with the sun, a daily ritual of gentle movement. Then, over Thanksgiving, life happened. I traveled, I rushed, and I came home to a heartbreaking sight: a dried-out, limp version of its former self.

I did everything I was supposed to—I watered it diligently, I even took a healthy cutting as a hopeful backup plan. But the main plant remained stressed, a silent testament to my own neglect.

Staring at its weary leaves, I didn't just see a plant; I saw my own stretched-thin energy. This past year has been about survival, about just getting through. My prayer plant wasn't just drying out from a lack of water; it was wilting from a lack of consistent, gentle care—the same kind I often deny myself.

So, I’m learning. Some things can be revived, and some things, like my little cutting, are a promise of new growth. The lesson isn't just about keeping a plant alive, but about remembering to tend to my own roots, too.
