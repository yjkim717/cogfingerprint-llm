"Getting stuck in a gaming loop - literally! I recently encountered a frustrating bug in Savage Planet where I couldn't restart Sychi's trial after dying. It took some trial and error (pun intended), but I finally found a fix. It got me thinking - how often do we get stuck in real life? By embracing the frustration and seeking help, we can overcome obstacles and level up our lives."
