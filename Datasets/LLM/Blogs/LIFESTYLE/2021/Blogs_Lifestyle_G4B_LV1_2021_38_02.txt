**The Weight of Watching, and a Gentle Plea**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2021 felt like a year of trying to *do* everything – career, fitness, social media… but sometimes the most important thing is just *being* there for someone else. Lately, I’ve been watching a close friend navigate a profound loss, and it’s hit me how isolating grief can be. 

There’s no rulebook for healing, and frankly, no one’s forcing folks to acknowledge the depth of it.  It made me think about my own friends – those going through similar heartache.  I wanted to gently suggest therapy, not as a fix, but as a safe space to unpack the weight.  It’s a vulnerable conversation, but sometimes, we need a little outside support to navigate the darkness.  Just a quiet, “I’m here, and I think talking to someone might help” can make all the difference.
