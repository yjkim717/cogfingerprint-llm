"A New Chapter for Saturday Shares: Embracing Sobriety Together"

As I sit down to write this post, I'm filled with a mix of emotions - nostalgia for what's come to an end, and excitement for what's to begin. For a while now, I've been sharing my Saturday Shares with you, our community, as a way to inspire and reflect on our collective journey towards a life of sobriety. It's been a labor of love, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have connected with so many of you through these stories.

However, as our community has grown, so too have the stories and experiences we want to share. In 2021, as we continue to navigate the ups and downs of life, I've come to realize that our Saturday Shares format, while wonderful, has become a bit limiting. We have so many incredible stories to tell, and I want to create a space where everyone can share their journey, not just mine.

So, I'm retiring the traditional Saturday Shares format to make way for something new. We're introducing a community-driven sharing system, where you, our community members, can share your own stories, struggles, and triumphs. Whether you're just starting out on your sobriety journey or have been on this path for years, we want to hear from you. This is your space to share, to inspire, and to connect with others who understand your journey.

I'm thrilled to embark on this new chapter with you all. Together, let's continue to support one another, sharing our stories and experiences to create a community that's truly greater than the sum of its parts.
