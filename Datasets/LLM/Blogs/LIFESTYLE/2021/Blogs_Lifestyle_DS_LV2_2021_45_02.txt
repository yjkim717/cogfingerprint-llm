When Mark and I merged our lives in 2021, merging our finances felt like the final frontier. We started with separate accounts, adding each other as authorized users, but it felt like we were roommates, not partners. The joint credit card was a game-changer. Suddenly, our budget became a shared mission, not a secret. It wasn't about control, but connection. We learned that a joint bank account isn't just about money; it's about building a life with a unified vision, one honest conversation at a time.
