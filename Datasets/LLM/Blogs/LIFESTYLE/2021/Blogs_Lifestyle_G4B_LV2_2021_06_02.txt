**The Waiting Game (and My Pixel 6 Pro)**

Late 2021 felt like a constant wait, didn’t it?  I’d just gotten my Pixel 6 Pro, hyped about its incredible camera – especially those night shots. But lately, it’s been… frustrating. Photos take *forever* to process, and sometimes it just freezes. It’s a tiny annoyance, sure, but it’s making me think about patience, and maybe even the quirks of new tech.  Is it a software glitch, or something deeper?  It’s a reminder that even the coolest gadgets aren't always seamless.
