Itâ€™s 2021, and my digital life was bursting at the seams. My trusty QNAP NAS, the heart of my PLEX server, was almost full. I dreaded a complicated, expensive upgrade. Then I found the TR-004 expansion unit. It was a game-changer. I could just slide in a new drive, expanding my RAID 5 storage one piece at a time. No drama, no server downtime. It felt less like a tech chore and more like tending a digital garden, watching my media library grow peacefully.
