**The Sleep Struggle & a Quest for Comfort**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 was *rough* for sleep, wasn’t it? Between the pandemic anxiety and everything else, I was battling a serious case of disrupted nights. My CPAP was the prescribed solution, but I’d hit a wall with my current mask – a Philips Nuance Pro that just wasn’t cutting it. 

It felt like a constant battle with the headgear, and the mask itself was uncomfortable. I’d even tried a Resmed Airfit N30 before, hoping for a better fit, but no luck.  

So, I'm embarking on a little research project – seriously considering a nasal mask or even a nasal pillow.  It feels a bit overwhelming, especially with the whole insurance question looming. But honestly, a good night’s sleep feels like a game-changer right now, and I’m determined to find something that actually works *with* my body, not against it. Wish me luck!
