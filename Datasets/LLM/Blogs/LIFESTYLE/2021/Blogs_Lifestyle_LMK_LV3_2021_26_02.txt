As a student in 2021, having the right laptop is crucial for success. For me, that means finding a ThinkPad that can seamlessly run both Ubuntu and Windows. With a budget of $1100-1300 CAD, I'm looking for a device that can handle web development, student work, and some light gaming. The perfect laptop should be a reliable companion, not a constraint. By choosing the right device, I can focus on what matters most - learning, creating, and maybe even squeezing in some gaming. The right tool can make all the difference in achieving my goals.
