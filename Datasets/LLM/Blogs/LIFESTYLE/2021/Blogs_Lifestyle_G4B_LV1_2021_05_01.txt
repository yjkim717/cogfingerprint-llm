**The Ghostly Wake-Ups**

Okay, so this is a weird one, and I've been wrestling with it for weeks. My laptop – bless its silicon heart – started doing this bizarre thing. It’d randomly wake from sleep mode, the screen would flicker to life, but my mouse and keyboard? Dead. Just…silent. 

It felt like a ghostly interruption to my workflow. Like the computer was *trying* to do something, but just couldn’t quite connect. I’d spend ages troubleshooting, checking settings, wondering if a rogue background program was the culprit.  Eventually, a full reboot was the only fix. 

It’s a frustrating little glitch, and honestly, it made me think about how easily we get caught up in productivity, expecting everything to just *work*.  Sometimes, the simplest solution – a little reset – is all you need.  Anyone else experience tech tantrums like this in 2021?
