**The Echoes of “What If?”**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single “what if?” can just… stick. 2021 felt like a year of those echoes for me. I was wrestling with a persistent regret, a low-humming depression fueled by a constant comparison game. I’d look at my friends’ accomplishments – a new job, a promotion, a beautiful family – and feel this sharp pang of, “Why not me?” 

It wasn’t about grand failures, really, more like a series of smaller missteps, decisions I’d second-guess endlessly. And honestly, it was starting to bleed into my family life. The quiet frustration, the feeling of being weighed down, was affecting everyone around me. 

I started trying to be kinder to myself, acknowledging that everyone stumbles. It’s a slow process, but realizing that chasing someone else’s highlight reel isn’t the key to happiness is… well, it’s a start.  Anyone else battling these ghosts?
