Looking back on 2021, I remember how daunting weekends felt in early sobriety. That first Saturday without a drink, I nervously tapped into the StopDrinking community. Reading stories from fellow sobernauts made me feel less alone. Their Saturday Shares weren’t just posts—they were lifelines, real people choosing "IWNDWYT" over old habits. It’s in sharing our journeys that we build this sober life, one weekend at a time. Grateful for every voice that speaks up.
