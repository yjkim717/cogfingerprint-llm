## The Weight of a Downvote

It’s a strange feeling, isn't it? Lately, I’ve been spending a little too much time on photography subreddits. Seeing so many identical shots flooding the Delhi feed felt… draining. I know it sounds harsh, but I'm hitting that downvote button a lot. It's not about the photographers themselves, but a quiet frustration with the constant noise, a longing for genuine connection in a digital space. Maybe we all need to be a little more mindful of what we share.
