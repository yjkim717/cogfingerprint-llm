## The Unexpected Pause

Remember that feeling when an interview ends, and they just…ask for your thoughts? It happened to me recently on a plant tour (chemical engineering life!), and I froze. It’s a weird space, wanting to be thoughtful but not overstep. It got me thinking about life in general – those unexpected pauses, the quiet requests to share what’s on your mind. Sometimes, the best response is just honest reflection. 2021 has been full of them!
