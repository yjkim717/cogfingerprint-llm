It’s 2021, and I’m craving a dose of nostalgia, so I dust off my old copy of Rainbow Six Vegas. Just me, a headset, and memories of late-night terrorist hunts with friends. But tonight, it’s different. I’m staring at a stubborn uPlay login error, locked out of the multiplayer chaos I loved.

It’s funny how something as simple as a game can remind you that not all doors from the past stay open. Ubisoft’s servers have moved on, and here I am, stuck in digital limbo. Sometimes, you can’t go back—even in pixels. A small lesson in letting go, delivered by a decade-old video game.
