As a student in 2021, I found myself juggling multiple tasks on my laptop - coding for web development, running Ubuntu for specific projects, and playing games to unwind. I needed a reliable machine that could handle it all. I set my sights on a ThinkPad that could dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows. With a budget of CAD 1100-1300, I was determined to find the perfect laptop to fit my lifestyle. After some research, I discovered the ideal ThinkPad model that met my needs, allowing me to stay productive and entertained on a budget.
