It’s funny how a single moment can change everything. Last night, I was watching the *For All Mankind* season 2 finale, and that scene with Sergei and Margo—with the Russian subtitles hinting at the Buran conspiracy—hit me differently. It made me think about my own life in 2021: how often do we trust people, only to realize later we’re being guided by hidden motives?

I’ve felt that in work, friendships, even my own choices. It’s a reminder to pause and reflect—are we living our truth, or someone else’s plan? Here’s to hoping season 3 brings clarity, and maybe we can find some of our own, too.
