## That Feeling When the Music Just *Clicks*

Remember that feeling in 2021 when you stumbled upon a song that instantly soundtracked your life? I had one – pure, electric energy, like skateboarding through a sun-drenched city. Fast lyrics, a driving guitar, with this cool electronic hum underneath. It reminded me of The Floozies’ ‘Stuntin’, that same playful, infectious vibe. It made mundane tasks feel… exhilarating. It's funny how a few seconds of music can encapsulate a whole mood, isn't it? What's *your* song?
