## Lost in Translation (and Loving It): My Tricot Obsession

Okay, confession time: I’m completely hooked on the Japanese band Tricot. Their energy is infectious, the music is brilliant, but I'm also wading into a sea of Japanese lyrics I barely understand. It’s thrilling and slightly terrifying! 

There's something so captivating about connecting with art you don't *fully* grasp. It’s like experiencing a feeling without knowing the exact words to describe it. I'm slowly chipping away at translations, hoping to unlock deeper layers of meaning. Part of me is bracing for the potential of discovering something wildly unexpected – or even a little offensive! – but honestly, the journey of discovery is half the fun. Anyone else diving deep into music from another culture?
