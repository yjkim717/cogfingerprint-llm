**The Frustrating Dance of a New Build**

Remember that feeling when a project *almost* works? I was deep into building my Voron 2.4 last year – 2021, to be exact – and hit a frustrating snag. It centered around the `PRINT_START` G-Code and how it interacted with the ERCF (that fancy filament loading system!). 

I’d get this insistent error, seemingly before the filament was even properly loaded. Turns out, the sequence was wrong. A little obsessive debugging – tweaking the `g-code`, adding a ‘purge line’ – eventually got it right. 

It felt oddly symbolic, really. Like life sometimes throws you a curveball before you’re even ready.  It’s a reminder that patience and a willingness to experiment are key, even when staring at a screen full of code.  Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from figuring out the right *order* of things.
