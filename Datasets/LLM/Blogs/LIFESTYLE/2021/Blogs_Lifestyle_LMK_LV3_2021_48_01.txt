As I sat down to review my recent home appraisal, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. The numbers stared back at me, revealing a staggering 40-45% increase in my home's value since I'd purchased it just a few years ago. It was a jarring reminder of the frenzied real estate boom that had taken hold of our housing market in 2021.

As someone who's been diligently working towards financial independence as part of the fire movement, this sudden surge in my home's value was both thrilling and tempting. The thought of selling my property and renting instead had begun to tantalize me, promising a potential shortcut to accelerating my journey towards financial freedom.

Refinancing options and the prospect of cashing in on the increased equity swirled in my mind as I weighed the pros and cons. It was undeniable that the housing market was on fire, and I was sitting on a significant gain. But was it wise to let the allure of a quick profit dictate my decision?

As I pondered my next move, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this was more than just a financial decision. It was about my lifestyle, my priorities, and what I truly valued. Was the pursuit of financial independence worth potentially disrupting my life and the lives of those I care about? Or should I stick to my original plan, letting my wealth grow steadily over time? The fire movement had taught me to be intentional with my finances, but now I had to be intentional with my choices.
