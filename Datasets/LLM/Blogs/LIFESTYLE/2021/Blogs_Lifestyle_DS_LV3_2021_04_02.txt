The week after Thanksgiving 2021, I faced a quiet crisis in my living room. My beloved prayer plant, usually a vibrant performer with leaves that reached for the sky each evening, had collapsed. In the holiday rush, I’d let the soil dry out completely.

Returning to its dramatic limp felt like a personal failure. I sprang into action with a careful watering, hoping for a swift recovery. I even took a proactive cutting from one of the last healthy stems, placing it in water like a promise for the future.

But weeks later, the main plant remains a sad, drooping silhouette. The new cutting has roots, a small victory, yet the parent seems stubbornly stuck. I find myself just watching it, learning a difficult lesson in patience. Not every problem has an instant fix, even with the best intentions. I’m now wondering if I need to let go—to snip away the most damaged leaves to make space for new growth. It’s a gentle reminder that sometimes, both in plant care and in life, recovery isn’t a straight line, but a slow, unfolding lesson in resilience.
