Last summer, I watched the fireworks through a sea of glowing screens. Everyone was filming, but I just stood there, feeling the booms in my chest. I realized my own phone was full of shaky concert clips I’d never rewatch. In 2021, we’re so busy capturing life we forget to live it. Now, I put the phone down. The best memories aren’t in your camera roll; they’re the ones you feel completely.
