When Mark and I merged our lives in 2021, the biggest leap of faith wasn't the shared last name—it was the joint credit card. We’d kept separate bank accounts for years, but managing two sets of spending felt like a constant budget tug-of-war. Adding each other as authorized users changed everything. Suddenly, our financial life became a single, transparent conversation. No more guessing, no more awkward transfers. It wasn't just about convenience; it was about building a united front, a shared responsibility that mirrored our partnership. For us, that piece of plastic became a quiet, daily reminder that we’re truly in this together.
