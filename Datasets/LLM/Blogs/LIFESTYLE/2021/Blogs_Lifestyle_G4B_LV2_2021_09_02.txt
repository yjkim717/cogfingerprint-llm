**The Shiny Mask & the Dusty Coalmine**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Scrolling through Instagram in 2021, feeling this pressure to *be* something – polished, exciting, effortlessly cool. I found myself staring at illustrations of fantastical worlds, wishing my own life had a little more… sparkle.

Suddenly, the shiny mask felt heavy.  Maybe true identity isn't about projecting an image, but about acknowledging the quiet corners of who we are – the anxieties, the passions, the grit.
