### The Anxious Wait: A Lesson in Patience from a Tiny Kitten

Remember that feeling in 2021, when waiting for any kind of news felt like an eternity? I was recently thrown right back into that emotional blender, but this time, the source of my anxiety was my new kitten, Luna.

Her spay surgery was supposed to be routine. But a few days later, a hard, worrying lump appeared near her incision. We started antibiotics, but the lump remainedâ€”a stubborn, visible reminder that things weren't okay. The hardest part was the agonizing wait for the vet to call back. Every silent minute stretched out, filled with "what ifs."

It was a stark reminder that life, much like wound healing, doesn't always follow our tidy schedules. It taught me to sit with the discomfort of uncertainty, to breathe through the anxiety, and to trust that just like Luna eventually bounced back, we find our way through the scary moments, one breath at a time.
