### The Day I Stopped Fighting the Clock

Remember that frantic, always-behind feeling of 2021? I was drowning in a sea of tabs and to-do lists, my productivity measured in cups of cold coffee. I was "busy" all day but had nothing to show for it by evening.

The turning point came on a Tuesday night, exhausted, when I finally took a piece of advice to heart: plan tomorrow, today. I spent five quiet minutes jotting down my three biggest tasks. The next morning, instead of checking emails and falling into a rabbit hole, I knew exactly where to start. I took it further, blocking out chunks of my digital calendar like appointments with myself and setting a simple timer for focused bursts.

It wasn't a magic trick; it was a mindset shift. By giving my time a deliberate structure, I stopped feeling like the day was happening *to* me. I finally started feeling like I was guiding it, one intentional block at a time.
