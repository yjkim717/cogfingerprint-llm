## The Unexpected Joy of a Monday Afternoon & a Very Good Boy

Okay, so here's the thing: I'm in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is already a dream. But I also have a very important mission – experiencing Meow Wolf! It’s been on my list forever. The only slight hiccup? My ridiculously adorable, but equally energetic, dog, Finn. 

Finding reliable pet care while traveling can be stressful, right? Especially when you want to squeeze in a few hours of exploring. Thankfully, I tracked down a fantastic, insured dog sitter. It’s amazing how a little planning can unlock so much joy. Now, I get to wander through the immersive art of Meow Wolf, knowing Finn is in safe, loving hands. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best adventures are the ones that accommodate all the important parts of your life – even the furry ones!
