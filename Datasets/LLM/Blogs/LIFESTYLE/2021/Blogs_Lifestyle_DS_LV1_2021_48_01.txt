It’s funny how a single sheet of paper can make you question everything. Last week, our house appraised for nearly 45% more than we paid for it less than a year ago. In 2021’s dizzying real estate market, numbers like that almost feel normal—but seeing them in black and white? It stopped me in my tracks.

My partner and I have been quietly trudging along our FIRE journey, saving where we can and dreaming of early retirement. But this… this could fast-forward our timeline by years. We’ve even started getting letters from cash buyers—no contingencies, quick closes. It’s tempting.

But then I walk through our garden, where we planted our first tree together, or past the kitchen where we learned to bake sourdough during lockdown. This isn’t just an asset; it’s our home.

So here we are, balancing spreadsheets against sentiment, opportunity against attachment. Do we cash in and leap toward financial freedom, or stay put in the place that holds our memories? I don’t have the answer yet—but for now, I’m just sitting with the question, grateful to even have the choice.
