"Embracing the Cloud for a Smoother Development Workflow"

As developers, we're always on the lookout for ways to streamline our workflow and stay productive. In 2021, I found myself pondering an unconventional approach: using Google Colab as a temporary development environment. Colab's cloud-based infrastructure offers a tantalizing prospect - spinning up a dev environment in seconds, without the hassle of local setup. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I might be pushing the boundaries of fair usage.

Is it abuse to use Colab for development, or is it just leveraging the cloud to get work done? I'd love to hear from fellow devs: have you experimented with ephemeral dev environments? Do you think Colab is intended for this use case, or should we stick to traditional local development? As we navigate the ever-changing landscape of software development, it's worth considering how cloud tools can enhance our workflow - and what that means for our workstyle.
