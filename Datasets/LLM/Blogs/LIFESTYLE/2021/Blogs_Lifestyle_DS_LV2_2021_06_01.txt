It was one of those quiet 2021 afternoons, working from my luxury apartment, when a sudden roar rattled the windows. Not the usual hum of downtown traffic or car exhaustsâ€”this was different, visceral. I rushed to the balcony just in time to see two fighter jets slicing through the sky, shockingly low. It was a stark, powerful reminder that even in our curated urban bubbles, the wider world is never far away.
