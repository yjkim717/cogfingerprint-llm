It was supposed to be our weekly co-op escape—a chance to unwind in 2021’s chaos. We dove into Sychi’s trial, laughing as we dodged the intricate laser grid. Then the bug hit. A single misstep, a death, and the trial refused to reset. No amount of reloading or frantic Googling could fix it. Our cooperative night was halted by a stubborn glitch, a stark reminder that sometimes, even in our digital retreats, we just have to accept the unexpected and try again tomorrow.
