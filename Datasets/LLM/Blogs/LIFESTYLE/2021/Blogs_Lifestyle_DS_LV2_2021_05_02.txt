**The Aquarium and My Quest for Balance**

Remember 2021? That year, my quest for inner peace somehow led me to staring at a fishtank. Iâ€™d built a DIY auto top-off system to maintain the perfect water level. It worked, but with a maddening flaw: the dual float switches would chatter on and off constantly, a frantic digital dance.

It hit me one evening, watching the relentless flicker of the relay. My own life felt just like that. I was constantly toggling between work and home, social media and silence, never settling into a steady state. The system wasn't broken; its timing was just too reactive.

So I stepped back. I didn't just tweak the electronics; I tweaked my schedule. I built in buffers, moments of intentional pause. The goal wasn't a perfect, motionless equilibrium, but a gentle, sustainable rhythm. Now, both my tank and I hold our level with a little more grace.
