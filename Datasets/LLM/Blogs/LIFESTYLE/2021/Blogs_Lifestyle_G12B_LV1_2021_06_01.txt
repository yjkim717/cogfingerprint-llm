## That Time Jersey City Thought the Sky Was Falling

It was a Tuesday in October 2021, and downtown Jersey City was…weird. A low, insistent roar was vibrating through the buildings. Everyone on Reddit was losing it – construction? A rogue garbage truck? My initial thought was some bizarre, amplified marketing stunt. Then, someone posted a video. Fighter jets. Seriously. 

It felt surreal, this sudden disruption of the everyday. We’re so used to the hum of city life, the predictable routines. For a few minutes, though, we were all looking up, a little breathless, wondering what was happening. It was a strange reminder that even in our little corner of the world, the unexpected can – and does – happen. And sometimes, it roars overhead.
