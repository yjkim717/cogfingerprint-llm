### The 3 AM Wake-Up Call

It’s 2021, and my greatest nemesis isn’t a looming deadline or a pile of dishes—it’s my own PC. Just last night, in the deep quiet of 3 AM, a soft *whirrr* cut through the silence. My monitor was glowing, a blank, accusatory eye in the dark. My PC had, for the third time this week, jolted itself awake from sleep mode for no reason at all.

But here’s the real kicker: the keyboard was dead. The mouse, a lifeless lump. The only solution? The dreaded hard reset. Holding down that power button feels like a betrayal, a forced shutdown of something that just won’t communicate.

As I lay in bed afterward, the adrenaline fading, I saw the parallel. How often do I jolt myself awake with anxiety, my mind buzzing with background worries, while my body and spirit feel completely unresponsive? The solution isn't always a brutal force-quit. Sometimes, it’s a gentle reboot—a deep breath, a walk, a conscious disconnection. My computer might need a tech fix, but its 3 AM tantrum was a human lesson in finding a softer reset button.
