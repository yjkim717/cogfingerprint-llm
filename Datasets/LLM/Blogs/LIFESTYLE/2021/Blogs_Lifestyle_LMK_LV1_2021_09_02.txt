"Embracing my dual identity has been a journey. As a writer and doodler, I'm still figuring out how to intro myself. Do I go with 'aspiring author' or 'hobbyist illustrator'? It's 2021, and social media makes it hard to escape comparisons. But I've come to realize that my creative pursuits aren't about titles â€“ they're about the joy they bring. So, I'll own my eclectic mix and proudly call myself a writer, artist, and everything in between."
