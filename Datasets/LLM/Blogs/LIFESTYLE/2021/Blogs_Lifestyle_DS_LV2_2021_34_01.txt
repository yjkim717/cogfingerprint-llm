There I was, staring at this beautiful 3D-printed PLA plaque I’d designed, a tribute to my late grandfather’s favorite quote. But the thought of marring it with visible screws to mount it on the old cedar backer felt wrong, like defacing the memory itself. It was 2021, and I was deep in the maker lifestyle, chasing that perfect, seamless finish. The solution? A hidden mechanical clip and a dab of strong adhesive. It’s a lesson in patience and craftsmanship—sometimes the strongest bonds are the ones you never see.
