Nostalgia got the better of me when I dug out my old copy of Rainbow Six Vegas on Steam. But, as I tried to jump into online multiplayer mode, I hit a roadblock - connectivity issues. It turned out that Ubisoft's uPlay account was the culprit, and I wasn't alone. Many gamers were facing the same problem. It's a reminder that our gaming experiences are often tied to the health of online ecosystems. As we revisit old favorites, we must also confront the reality of maintaining these platforms, and the impact on our gaming lives.
