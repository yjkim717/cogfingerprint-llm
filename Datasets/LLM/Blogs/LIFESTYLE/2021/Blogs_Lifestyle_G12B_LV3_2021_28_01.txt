## Where Does the Light Go? A Little Physics, a Lot of Wonder

Remember those laser pointer demonstrations in science class? Two beams colliding, seemingly vanishing into nothing? It always felt a bit… unsettling. It got me thinking about energy, really. We learn about thermodynamics – energy can't be created or destroyed, just transformed. So, where *does* that light energy go when interference happens? It’s a tiny physics puzzle that reminds me how much we still have to learn about the universe, and how much beauty lies in those unanswered questions.
