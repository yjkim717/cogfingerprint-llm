## The Little Things That Keep Me Sane (and Sometimes Frustrate Me)

It’s late 2021, and honestly, the world feels a bit… precarious. Between everything, I've been finding solace in the small, repetitive tasks. Like my aquarium. Sounds weird, right? But tinkering with it, keeping it balanced, is surprisingly meditative.

I built an automatic top-off system a while back – a little DIY project involving a float switch and a relay. The idea was simple: when the water level drops, the switch triggers the relay, which turns on the pump to top it off. Seemed brilliant in theory. 

The reality? It was a constant battle. The pump would kick on and off erratically, sometimes for too long, sometimes not at all. It was infuriating! I spent a solid afternoon troubleshooting, re-wiring things, and generally feeling like a frustrated engineer.

But then, finally, I figured it out – a simple connection issue. And when that little pump started reliably topping off the water, maintaining that perfect balance, it felt like a tiny victory.  It reminded me that even amidst chaos, focusing on the details, solving little problems, can bring a real sense of calm and control. It's a reminder to appreciate the small, consistent things in life, even when they occasionally give you a headache.



Hope this suits your needs!
