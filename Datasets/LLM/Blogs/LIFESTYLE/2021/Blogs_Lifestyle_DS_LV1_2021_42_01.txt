You’d think after the year we’ve had, a little snow in the forecast wouldn’t send everyone into a frenzy. But here we are in 2021, and the scene at my local grocery store was something else. I just needed eggs, but the place was packed. The bread aisle was a ghost town, the milk cooler picked clean, and the checkout lines snaked halfway to the back.

It got me thinking—when did a dusting of snow become a five-alarm emergency? I remember simpler winters, before the collective anxiety of empty shelves became our default setting. It’s a strange new habit, this instinct to stockpile at the first sign of a flurry. I left with my eggs and a reminder that sometimes, the storm we prepare for the most is the one in our own minds.
