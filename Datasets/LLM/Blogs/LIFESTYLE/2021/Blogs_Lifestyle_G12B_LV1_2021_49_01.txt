## The Unexpected Barrier to Sharing

It's funny how small changes can throw a wrench in your routine. Lately, I've been trying to share a little questionnaire – just a fun, informal thing to gather feedback on a local community project. Simple, right? Except Google decided to throw a curveball. Now, Google Forms requires a sign-in with a Google account. 

Seriously? For a quick poll about favorite park features? 

It’s frustrating because it immediately creates a barrier. People are less likely to participate if it means another login, another password to remember. It feels like a needless hurdle, a little piece of digital friction that’s ultimately hindering connection. It makes me wonder, are we letting these systems, designed to connect us, actually isolate us instead? Just a little thought sparked by a slightly annoying form.
