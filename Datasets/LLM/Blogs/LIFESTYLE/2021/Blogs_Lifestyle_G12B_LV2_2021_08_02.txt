## The Unexpected Joy of Letting Go (and Meow Wolf!)

Okay, confession time: I'm *that* person who gets ridiculously attached to their dog. So, planning a trip to Santa Fe this year, especially one that included the mesmerizing Meow Wolf, feltâ€¦ complicated.  My sweet pup, Leo, needed watching! Finding a good dog sitter felt like a huge deal. 

But you know what?  It was surprisingly freeing.  Handing Leo over to a kind soul allowed me to truly immerse myself in the art and wonder of Meow Wolf. It was a reminder that sometimes, letting go, trusting others, and prioritizing those little moments of joy are exactly what we need.  And Leo? He had a blast too, apparently!




Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
