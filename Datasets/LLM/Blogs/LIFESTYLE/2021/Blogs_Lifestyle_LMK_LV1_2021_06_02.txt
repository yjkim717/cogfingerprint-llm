As I snapped photos with my Pixel 6 Pro in 2021, I was frustrated by slow processing times. In low light, it took 20-30 seconds for a single shot to finalize. Nights out were marred by delayed photos, making me wonder if the tech was holding me back. I longed to relive memories instantly, not wait for my phone to catch up.
