As I pondered my next real estate move in 2021, a nagging question lingered: will my investment property mortgage hinder my chances of securing a primary residence mortgage? I've always been diligent about my finances, but the thought of taking on another mortgage made me uneasy. Will lenders view my investment property as a liability, or can I prove it's a savvy financial move? Only time (and a chat with my lender) will tell.
