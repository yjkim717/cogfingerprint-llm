## The Kitchen Battlefield: Pandemic Habits and Family Clutter

2021 has been… a lot, hasn’t it? For many of us, it meant a shift in routines, anxieties swirling, and a surprising urge to stockpile everything from toilet paper to flour. But what happens when those pandemic habits, coupled with pre-existing tendencies, create a real-life clutter crisis? 

I stumbled across a post on Reddit the other day that really resonated. Someone was struggling to reclaim their kitchen from years of ingrained disorganization, amplified by their parents’ pandemic stockpiling. It hit close to home. We all have those spaces, don’t we? Those areas where good intentions and family dynamics tangle with the reality of overflowing drawers and precarious stacks. 

It's not just about the mess, it's about the emotional weight. It’s about navigating differing perspectives and finding storage solutions that actually *work* within a family system. Anyone else feeling this particular kind of overwhelmed?
