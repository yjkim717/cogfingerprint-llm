## The Quiet Power of Letting Go (and a Little Physics!)

Isn't it funny how life sometimes mirrors the most unexpected things? I was reading about lasers the other day – seriously! – and stumbled across this idea about light beams canceling each other out. Apparently, the energy doesn't *disappear*; it just transforms. It’s all about thermodynamics and energy conservation.

It got me thinking about my own life, really.  So many times, I've clung to things – grudges, anxieties, even old possessions – that were just creating a kind of chaotic energy.  2021 has been about consciously *letting go*. Not disappearing, of course, but transforming those energies into something lighter, something new. It's a quieter kind of power, wouldn't you agree?
