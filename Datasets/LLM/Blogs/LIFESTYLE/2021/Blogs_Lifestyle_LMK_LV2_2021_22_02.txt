"Discovering a Japanese Band that Transcended Language Barriers. In 2021, I found myself inexplicably drawn to a Japanese band, despite not speaking a word of Japanese. Their infectious melodies and energetic beats sparked an obsession. As I listened to their songs on repeat, I couldn't help but wonder what stories they told. The language barrier only added to the allure. It made me realize that music is a universal language, capable of bridging cultural divides and speaking directly to our souls. It changed my perspective on music and how it connects us all."
