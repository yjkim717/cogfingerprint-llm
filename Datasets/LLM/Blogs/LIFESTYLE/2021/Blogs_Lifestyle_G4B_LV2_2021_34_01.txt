**The Little Fixes That Matter**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a tiny problem can suddenly feel huge? Last year, I was wrestling with a frustrating project – a beautiful, thin PLA plaque I’d 3D printed, desperately trying to attach it to a wooden backer. Glue just wasn’t cutting it. It felt like a miniature battle of wills. 

Ultimately, I found a clever mechanical attachment, using adhesive as a support. It wasn't about the plaque itself, really. It was about the satisfaction of figuring it out, of making something *work*. Those little fixes, those small victories – they’re the quiet anchors of a good life, aren't they?
