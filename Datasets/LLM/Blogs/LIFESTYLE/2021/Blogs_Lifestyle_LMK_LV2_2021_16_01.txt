As I jammed with my Boss Katana 50MK2 amp in 2021, I stumbled upon a frustrating issue - switching between channels using my foot controller and switch pedal. It was like being stuck in a musical rut. I realized that sometimes, it's the little things that can disrupt our creative flow. In that moment, I learned to appreciate the importance of seamless transitions in music, and in life.
