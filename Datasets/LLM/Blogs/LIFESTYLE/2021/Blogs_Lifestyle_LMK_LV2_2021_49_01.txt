"Embracing the Digital Nomad Lifestyle in 2021. As I sat in my cozy home office, sipping coffee and staring at my laptop, I realized that Google Forms was holding me back. I wanted to share a simple survey with friends and family, but it kept asking them to sign in. The frustration was real! I discovered that I could simply toggle off the 'require sign-in' option, making my form public and accessible to all. It was a small victory, but it made me appreciate the flexibility of the digital lifestyle, where even the smallest tweaks can make a big difference."
