As I navigated the challenges of working from home in 2021, I stumbled upon a surprising productivity hack: virtual machines. Configuring VMware Workstation on my Windows 10 machine to assign static IPs to guest OSes using NAT networking was a game-changer. It wasn't just about tech - it was about creating a seamless workflow that mirrored my lifestyle. By streamlining my virtual setup, I freed up mental energy to focus on what truly mattered: balancing work, life, and everything in between. Little tweaks can add up to make a big difference.
