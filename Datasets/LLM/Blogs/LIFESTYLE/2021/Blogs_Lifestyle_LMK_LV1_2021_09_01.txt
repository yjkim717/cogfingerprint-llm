As I looked back on 2021, I realized my kitchen had undergone a transformation. I found myself drawn to plant-based foods and experimenting with pickling and fermenting. Vegetable-centred meals became the norm, and I discovered a new love for the spicy depth gojuchang adds to dishes. It was more than just a culinary shift - it was a lifestyle change. I felt more connected to the food I ate and the world around me. This newfound passion is something I'm excited to continue exploring in the years to come.
