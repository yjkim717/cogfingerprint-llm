There I was in 2021, thinking I'd finally mastered the work-from-home balance. My laptop was my trusty sidekick—or so I believed. But then came the phantom wake-ups.

Just like clockwork, my PC would rouse itself from sleep mode in the dead of night, screen glowing ominously in the dark room. Yet my keyboard remained lifeless, mouse dark—none of the usual peripherals stirring. Each time, I’d stumble over, sigh, and hold down the power button for a hard reset, my patience thinning with every forced reboot.

I started wondering: what invisible background programs were conspiring against my peace? Was it an update, a forgotten tab, some digital ghost in the machine? It felt symbolic, really—how often do we let unseen background noise disrupt our own rest?

In troubleshooting my PC, I realized I needed to troubleshoot my life too. Quiet the clutter, close the tabs of worry, and grant myself the true, uninterrupted sleep my computer so stubbornly refused. Sometimes, the glitches we fix outside help us reset within.
