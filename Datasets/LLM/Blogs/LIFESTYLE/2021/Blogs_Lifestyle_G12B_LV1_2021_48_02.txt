## The Little Things & Last-Minute Mayhem

It's funny how life throws you curveballs, isn't it? This week, it was a frantic scramble to help my grandma travel. She’s heading to visit family in Southeast Asia – a trip she’s been dreaming of for ages. But her flight, booked months ago, showed zero upgrade options online. Panic set in! 

Turns out a quick (and slightly nerve-wracking) phone call to United actually did the trick. A simple request, a little persistence, and suddenly she’s in a better seat. It reminded me that sometimes, the digital world isn't everything. A human touch, a phone call, can make all the difference, especially when it comes to making someone’s journey a little more comfortable. Small victories, right?
