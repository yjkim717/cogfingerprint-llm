### The Waiting Game

It was the little things I missed in 2021. Simple, quiet moments. So when we brought our new kitten, Pip, home after her spay surgery, I was ready for a week of cozy recovery. We followed all the post-op rules, but then a hard, walnut-sized lump appeared right under her incision.

The vet prescribed antibiotics, but the lump remained, a stubborn little stone under her skin. My cozy week dissolved into a low-grade hum of anxiety, refreshing my email every five minutes for a response from the clinic.

It was a stark reminder that life doesn't follow a tidy script. Healing isn't always a straight line, and sometimes the hardest part is just waiting, trusting that even when you can't see progress, things are still working themselves out beneath the surface. Itâ€™s a lesson that felt deeply relevant to that entire year of uncertainty.
