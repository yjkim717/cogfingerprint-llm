## My Prayer Plant's Plea (and a Little Lesson in Patience)

Okay, friends, I need to confess something. I’m a plant mom who seriously dropped the ball. Thanksgiving happened, the weather took a nosedive here in 2021, and my poor prayer plant, bless its little heart, suffered. We’re talking limp leaves, drooping dramatically, the whole nine yards. It looked like it was actively mourning the end of November.

Honestly, I felt terrible. I’d been so focused on the holiday chaos that I completely forgot about its needs – the consistent watering, the humidity it craves. It was a stark reminder that even the things we love need consistent care, right?

Now, I’m trying to nurse it back to health. There’s a lot of conflicting advice online – prune the dead leaves? Wait and see? I’ve decided to lean into patience. I’m misting it regularly, making sure it’s getting enough light, and just… observing. 

It’s a good lesson, really. Sometimes, the best thing you can do for something struggling isn't a dramatic intervention, but quiet, consistent support. And maybe, just maybe, my prayer plant will teach me a thing or two about resilience along the way. Wish me luck!
