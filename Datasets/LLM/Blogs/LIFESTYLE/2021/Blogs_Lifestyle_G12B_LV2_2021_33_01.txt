## The Waiting Game (and a Little Hope)

Okay, so I'm diving deep into the trans masculine hair growth rabbit hole. Rogaine and castor oil are currently my best friends! It’s a weird feeling, wanting to cultivate something so intrinsically linked to masculinity without actually taking testosterone. The Reddit community has been a lifeline – so much shared experience. Patience, they say. Lots and lots of patience. Anyone else feeling this slow burn?



I hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
