Traveling with my dog has always been one of life’s simple joys, but 2021 taught me the importance of planning ahead. On a trip to Santa Fe, I was eager to explore the mind-bending art at Meow Wolf, but my furry friend couldn’t join inside. A quick search led me to a local dog sitter who gave him a fun afternoon of walks and play. It reminded me that balancing adventure with responsibility—whether for pets or ourselves—makes every journey richer and more meaningful.
