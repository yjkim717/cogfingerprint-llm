## The Slow Dance of My Gut & Finding My Rhythm

It’s been a weird year, hasn't it? 2021. We’re all still figuring things out. For me, a lot of that figuring-out has been intensely personal, revolving around my daughter’s health. She's been battling gastroparesis for a while now, and honestly, seeing her struggle with something so invisible has been heartbreaking. 

It’s a slow-moving, frustrating condition. Food just… doesn’t move through the digestive system like it should. We've been navigating specialists, medications (like Reglan, and now exploring alternatives like domperidone), and a whole lot of trial and error.

Recently, I've been researching autonomic disorders – it seems to be closely linked. Finding a doctor who *really* understands the complexities of both? That’s been the biggest challenge. We’re aiming for an autonomic clinic, somewhere with a GI doctor who truly gets it. It feels like searching for a specific kind of music, hoping to find the right rhythm to ease her discomfort. It’s a journey, and we're taking it one small step at a time.
