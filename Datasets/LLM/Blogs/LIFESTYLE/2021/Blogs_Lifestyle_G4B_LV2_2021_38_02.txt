**When Grief Makes It Hard to Ask for Help**

It’s 2021, and honestly, the world felt…heavy.  I remember watching friends navigate the impossible after a sudden loss, and feeling utterly helpless.  It’s not about grand gestures, is it? It’s about the quiet, insistent need for support that often gets buried under the weight of grief. 

Recently, a dear friend was struggling, and I realized I was offering tea and sympathy instead of gently suggesting therapy. It felt awkward, like I was pushing. But seeing her light dim, I knew I had to be braver. 

Sometimes, the hardest thing about supporting someone grieving is recognizing they might not *want* to talk. Offering a simple, “I’m here if you need anything, including a professional to talk to,” can make all the difference.  It’s a reminder that prioritizing mental health after loss isn’t selfish; it’s essential.
