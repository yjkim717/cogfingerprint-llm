## The Weight of 'What If?' and Building Something New

It’s funny, isn’t it? How life can feel like a constant balancing act between the joy of the present and the ghosts of the past. Lately, I’ve been doing a *lot* of thinking about those ghosts. Maybe it’s the impending arrival of our little one – due in November – but I've found myself wrestling with a familiar, unwelcome visitor: regret.

For a good chunk of my twenties, I floundered. I bounced between jobs, chasing the shiny allure of something “better” without ever really knowing what that *was*. There was a period, a particularly dark one between 2018 and 2019, where I was unemployed for almost nine months. Looking back, it wasn’t just about the lack of income; it was the feeling of inadequacy. The constant questioning. *Was I good enough? Did I even have anything to offer?* The self-worth took a serious hit.

I know, I know, everyone has tough times. But when you're in it, it feels isolating. And the thing about regret is, it’s a sneaky beast. It whispers insidious little ‘what ifs’ in your ear. *What if I’d stayed at that stable job, even if it wasn’t inspiring? What if I’d invested in that online course instead of… well, instead of just scrolling through social media?*

My wife, bless her, has been my rock through all of this. She’s always been the steady presence, the one who sees the potential even when I’m struggling to see it myself. And it's her, and the incredible gift of our child, that’s forcing me to confront these feelings head-on.

Parental guilt is a whole new level, isn't it? Wanting so desperately to provide a stable, happy life for this tiny human, and simultaneously being haunted by past choices that feel… less than stellar. 2021 has been a year of a lot of reflection.

But here's the thing I'm realizing: you can’t rewrite the past. All you can do is learn from it. I’m trying to channel that regret into action. I'm focusing on being present with my wife, committing to being a truly engaged father, and finally building a career that feels both fulfilling and secure. It's not about erasing those past mistakes, but about using them as a foundation to build something new, something stronger.  This little one is giving me a powerful incentive to do just that.
