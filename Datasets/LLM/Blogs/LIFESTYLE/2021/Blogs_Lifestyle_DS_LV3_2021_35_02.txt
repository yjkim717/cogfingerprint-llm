There I was in 2021, endlessly tweaking the franchise mode sliders in MLB The Show, chasing that satisfying crack of good contact. It felt like a metaphor for my own life—making small adjustments, hoping for perfect contact to turn potential into hits. Some days you line out; other times, you find a gap. It’s not just about winning the game, but learning to appreciate the process of getting better, one small change at a time.
