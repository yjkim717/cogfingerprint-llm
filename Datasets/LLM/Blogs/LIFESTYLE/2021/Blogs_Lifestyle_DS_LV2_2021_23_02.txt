It’s funny how life shifts in a year. In 2021, I was a sophomore, scrolling through endless listings for "female roommates" and "$500 rent," feeling completely overwhelmed. The search for a stranger to share a 3/2 apartment near campus felt like a high-stakes gamble. Would she be a neat freak? A night owl?

But then I found my now-roommate at Silver Creek. We bonded over a shared love for bad reality TV and a mutual fear of palmetto bugs. Moving in was more than just securing student housing; it was about building a tiny, chosen family. We’ve navigated online classes, shared countless late-night talks, and learned that home isn’t just a place—it’s the person who saves you the last slice of pizza. Sometimes, the biggest adventures start with a simple "roommate wanted" ad.
