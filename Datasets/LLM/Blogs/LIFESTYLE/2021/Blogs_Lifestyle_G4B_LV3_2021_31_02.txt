**A Little Help, One Freezer at a Time**

It’s funny how small acts of kindness can ripple outwards, isn’t it? I’ve been thinking a lot about the challenges some families face, especially when illness and financial strain collide. A friend recently shared she’s supporting a family friend battling uncontrolled diabetes, and the worry is palpable. 

I started brainstorming – maybe a collection of simple, low-carb freezer meals could offer a lifeline. Meal prepping, even in small batches, feels like a way to offer practical support and a little bit of peace. It’s about more than just food; it’s about family, and showing up when it matters most. 2021 felt like a year for connection, and this felt like a way to connect through care.
