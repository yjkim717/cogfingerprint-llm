**The Weight of a Heady Topper**

It’s funny how small moments can suddenly feel…heavy. It was late 2021, and I was nursing a perfectly decent IPA – a genuinely good beer, nothing flashy – at a friend’s place.  He casually mentioned he had a “heady topper” he’d been saving, a ridiculously rare vintage brew. I barely registered it, honestly. I was just enjoying the company. 

Then, a few days later, a text popped up.  “Just wanted to let you know…this beer is worth a small fortune.”  My world tilted.  Suddenly, that casual evening felt different. A wave of regret washed over me – not for anything I’d *done*, but for not appreciating the significance of what was right in front of me. 

It wasn't about the money, of course. It was about respecting something someone held dear, about recognizing the value of a shared experience beyond just the beer itself.  It sparked this strange realization about how often we take things – and people – for granted. 

We all have those moments, those little treasures we don't fully grasp until it’s too late.  It's a reminder to be a little more present, a little more mindful of the things, and the people, that truly matter.  Maybe it’s time to start looking beyond the surface and appreciating the rarity in our everyday lives.
