## Seattle Hustle: Can Experience Really Buy Peace of Mind?

Okay, real talk. Seattle’s beautiful, but the cost of living? Ouch. I just saw a Reddit post that really resonated – someone with seven years of restaurant experience, desperately searching for a $25-$35/hour job. It hit close to home. We all hustle, right? But is it enough to truly feel secure when rent and groceries are constantly climbing? It makes you wonder if experience alone can truly buy a little peace of mind these days.
