It was 2021, and my friend’s type 2 diabetes felt like a relentless storm. Between medical bills and long hours, healthy eating seemed impossible. So, I rolled up my sleeves one Sunday for a "meal prep marathon." I focused on low-carb, diabetic-friendly dishes—think hearty veggie soups and seasoned chicken breasts—all portioned for the freezer. It wasn't just about food; it was a lifeline. Seeing her relief, I realized that a stocked freezer can be a profound act of love, turning health struggles into manageable, hopeful moments.
