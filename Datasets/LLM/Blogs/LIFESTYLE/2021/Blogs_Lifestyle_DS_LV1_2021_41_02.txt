**The Ghosts in Our Machines**

It’s funny the things we leave behind. The other day, a wave of nostalgia hit, and I decided to reinstall an old favorite, *Rainbow Six Vegas*. A few clicks on Steam, and it was downloading—a digital time capsule from 2007.

But when I tried to jump into a classic Terrorist Hunt, I was met with a stubborn uPlay login error. The servers, it seems, are just ghosts now. Ubisoft has long since moved on.

It was a small, sharp reminder in 2021: not everything can be revisited. Some doors close for good, both in games and in life. It made me appreciate the present moments I’m living now, the ones not dependent on a server’s heartbeat. Sometimes, the past is best left as a warm, pixelated memory.
