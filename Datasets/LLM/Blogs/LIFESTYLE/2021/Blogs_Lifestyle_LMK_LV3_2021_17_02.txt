The woes of online shopping! In 2021, I learned a valuable lesson about double-checking payment methods on e-commerce sites. I accidentally selected bank transfer for two orders and panicked. Luckily, the site's customer support was responsive, and I was able to change my payment method to card payment. Now, I'm more mindful when shopping online, appreciating the importance of a smooth checkout process.
