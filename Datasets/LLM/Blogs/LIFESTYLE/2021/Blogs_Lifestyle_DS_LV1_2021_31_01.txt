It’s 2021, and my kitchen has officially declared war on me. I blame the pandemic stockpiling phase—those early days of uncertainty left me with a mountain of canned beans, pasta, and mystery sauces. Now, my counters are buried under teetering piles, and every meal prep feels like an archaeological dig.

I’ve decided enough is enough. No fancy, expensive organizers—just practical, budget-friendly fixes. I started with clear bins for visibility and labeled everything, turning chaos into calm one shelf at a time. It’s amazing how a little order can lift the weight off your shoulders. My kitchen is becoming a functional space again, reminding me that even small steps toward decluttering can bring big peace in uncertain times.
