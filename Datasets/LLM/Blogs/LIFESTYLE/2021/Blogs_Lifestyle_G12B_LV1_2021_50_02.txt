## The Little File That Held a Summer

It's funny how easily moments vanish. Last summer, I was excitedly editing videos from a trip to the coast, only to discover a crucial .mpl file – a recording essential for playback – had somehow vanished from my Sony camera's SD card. Panic! Hours spent searching, a digital scavenger hunt. Ultimately, the lost file meant losing a chunk of that sunshine. It’s a good reminder to back *everything* up, isn't it? Life's too short to lose memories to a careless click.
