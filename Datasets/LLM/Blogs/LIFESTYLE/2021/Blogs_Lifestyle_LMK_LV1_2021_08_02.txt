"As I explored Denver with my furry sidekick in 2021, I realized that traveling with dogs requires some extra planning. We were excited to visit Meow Wolf, but our hotel had a strict no-leaving-dogs-alone policy. I was relieved to find a trustworthy dog sitter to take care of my pup for a few hours. For fellow pet owners, I learned that researching local dog walkers and sitters is a must. It's worth the extra cost for peace of mind, allowing you to enjoy your trip with your loyal companion by your side - or not!"
