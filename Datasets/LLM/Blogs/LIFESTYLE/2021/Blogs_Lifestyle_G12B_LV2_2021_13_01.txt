Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable lifestyle tone, and set in 2021. I've tried to weave in the core anxiety of the situation while keeping it broadly applicable to anyone facing uncertainty.

## The Waiting Game & Tiny Paws

It’s funny, isn’t it, how life throws you curveballs when you least expect them? We got our little Willow spayed last week – a milestone, a responsible thing to do, we thought. But now? Now we’re in that unsettling space of waiting.

She’s recovering, mostly, but there's some post-surgery swelling and…a little lump that's got me Googling way too much at 2 AM. The vet’s playing catch-up with responses, and honestly, the anxiety is a physical thing. It’s that tight feeling in your chest, the constant checking, the overthinking every little meow.

It’s a stark reminder that even the best-laid plans, the most routine procedures, can be laced with uncertainty. And it's made me think about all the other "waiting games" we're all playing right now, in 2021. Waiting for vaccine updates, for a return to normalcy, for a resolution to…well, everything.

Sending all the good vibes to Willow, and maybe a little to all of us navigating the unknown. Hoping for good news soon. ❤️
