Suddenly, sharing a simple recipe survey with my book club became a hurdle. It reminded me of how even our virtual spaces are tightening, making me long for the ease of open connection. In a way, it mirrored my own life—learning to balance boundaries with accessibility, both online and off, in a world that keeps asking for just a little more from us.
