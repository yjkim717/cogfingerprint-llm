You know that feeling when you’re giving your all—work, family, social life—and it still feels like you’re running on empty? It reminds me of a physics puzzle: two laser beams can cancel each other out, but the energy doesn’t vanish; it just shifts. In 2021, I realized my own energy works the same way. When life feels like it’s subtracting, maybe I’m just redirecting my light somewhere new.
