## The Quiet Shift & Finding My Rhythm

It's funny how routines can become little anchors in the swirling chaos of life, isn’t it? For a while now, I've been hosting "Saturday Shares" here on the blog – a space for folks in recovery to share their weekend struggles and triumphs. It was born out of a genuine need for connection, a desire to build a little corner of the internet where we could all feel seen and supported.

2021 has been... a lot. We all know that, right? Between the ongoing pandemic, the political climate, and just the general weight of the world, it’s been a year of adjustments. And, honestly, the Saturday Shares haven't been quite the same lately. Participation has been a bit ebb and flow, and I realized trying to force a weekly live-ish format wasn't serving anyone, least of all me.

It felt a little like ghosting, in a way – not malicious, but a quiet withdrawing from a structure that wasn’t quite working. I was wrestling with how to keep the spirit of the shares alive while also respecting everyone's fluctuating energy levels. Relapses happen. Life gets in the way. Sometimes, showing up just isn’t possible.

So, I’ve decided to shift things. Instead of a live Saturday post, I’ll be compiling a weekly summary – a collection of shared experiences, insights, and encouragement gathered throughout the week. It's still about community, still about sharing, but with a little more flexibility.

It's a reminder, I think, that recovery isn't a rigid checklist. It’s a dance, a constant recalibration. And sometimes, the best thing we can do is adjust our steps to find a rhythm that truly works. I hope you’ll still check in – and please, keep sharing your stories. They matter.
