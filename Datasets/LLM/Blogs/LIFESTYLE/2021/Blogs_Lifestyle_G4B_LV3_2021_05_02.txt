**The Tiny Battle Against Evaporation**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of little, persistent battles. Big ones – the pandemic, climate anxiety – were looming, but it was the smaller stuff that really wore me down. Like, the constant need to top off my aquarium. I’d built a simple, DIY auto-top-off system, using a float switch and a relay, figuring it would be a weekend project. 

It wasn’t. It was a frustrating series of tweaks and resets. The whole thing felt surprisingly complex – a tiny microcosm of the challenges of even the simplest electronics. 

It made me realize something: we often underestimate the effort involved in maintaining even the most basic aspects of our lives. That little system, fighting evaporation, mirrored my struggle to stay afloat amidst everything else.  Sometimes, the quiet victories – a perfectly functioning circuit, a full aquarium – are the most rewarding.
