**A Weekend of Weird & Wonderful**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of leaning into the unexpected, didn’t it? This past Monday, I was juggling a serious travel dilemma. I was heading to Santa Fe with Gus – my goofy golden – and desperately needed a dog sitter. It wasn’t a fancy trip; just a quick escape to see Meow Wolf and soak up the New Mexican vibes.  Finding someone reliable felt crucial, and I even briefly considered a dog hotel!  But ultimately, a fantastic dog walker stepped up. It’s those little moments of trusting someone to care for my best friend that really make life feel…well, good.
