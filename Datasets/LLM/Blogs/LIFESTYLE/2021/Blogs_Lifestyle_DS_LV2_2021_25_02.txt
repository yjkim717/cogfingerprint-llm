You know that feeling when you’re just trying to get through the week, and life throws you a glitch? My friend and I spent hours on this co-op game—Sychi’s Trial—only to hit a bug that kept resetting our progress. No matter how many times we restarted, we couldn’t move forward.

It hit me: isn’t that 2021 in a nutshell? We keep trying to push through, but sometimes the system itself needs a fix. Maybe it’s a sign to step back and breathe.
