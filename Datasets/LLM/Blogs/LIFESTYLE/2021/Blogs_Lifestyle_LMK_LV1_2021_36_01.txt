As I navigated my dual-boot setup in 2021, I realized my NTFS partition was a major bottleneck. Seeking a high-performance alternative that wouldn't sacrifice Windows compatibility, I turned to Linux filesystems. After some research, I discovered a few NTFS alternatives that not only boosted my storage speed but also offered robust error checking. By switching to a more efficient filesystem, I was able to streamline my workflow and enjoy seamless document and media storage across both Linux Mint and Windows - a lifestyle upgrade I didn't know I needed.
