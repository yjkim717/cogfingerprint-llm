**The Robot Rebellion (and My Wi-Fi)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2021 and I’m wrestling with a robot vacuum. A *Neato D5*, no less. I’d pictured a seamless, futuristic home – and this little guy was supposed to be the key. But after a frustrating factory reset, pairing it with the Neato app became a full-blown battle. 

Honestly, I spent a solid afternoon battling Wi-Fi issues and feeling utterly defeated. It’s a surprisingly relatable struggle, right?  We buy these gadgets to *simplify* our lives, and sometimes they just add another layer of complexity.  It reminded me that tech, for all its promise, doesn't always magically fix everything. Sometimes, you just need to breathe and remember it’s just a robot!
