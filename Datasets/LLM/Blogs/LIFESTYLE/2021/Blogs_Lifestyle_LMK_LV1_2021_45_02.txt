"Merging Finances: A Joint Credit Card Conundrum"

As I navigated my finances in 2021, I found myself pondering a pressing question: should my spouse and I merge our credit cards? We'd discussed joint bank accounts, but credit cards felt different. I worried about losing financial autonomy, while my partner saw it as a step towards unity. As I weighed our options, I realized that effective credit card management was key. By considering both individual and joint accounts, we could create a budgeting system that worked for us, not against us. It was time to merge our finances - and our futures.
