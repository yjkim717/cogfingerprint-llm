## The Unexpected Therapist in My Own Life

Okay, 2021 has been… a lot. Lately, I've been thinking about *Arrested Development* and Tobias, specifically. He's a mess, right? But sometimes, amidst all the dramatic acting and questionable choices, he delivers these surprisingly astute observations. It got me thinking about the people in *my* life who aren't traditionally "helpful," but offer unexpected wisdom. My quirky Aunt Carol, for instance, whose unsolicited advice is often delivered with a side-eye and a raised eyebrow, somehow always hits the mark. Maybe we all need a little Tobias in our lives – a delightfully flawed, oddly perceptive observer.
