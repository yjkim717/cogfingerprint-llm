Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions:

**The Weight of “Just Get Over It”**

It’s 2021, and honestly, navigating my ADHD felt like wading through molasses. I’d finally admit I needed help, but the first hurdle was a giant, blinking sign: insurance. It felt so dismissive, like “just get over it” when my brain was literally wired differently. 

Then came the search for a therapist – and the *books*! I devoured recommendations, hoping to find a guide that actually resonated with the chaos.  It’s isolating feeling like you’re fighting a battle no one truly understands.  I realized seeking support wasn't a weakness; it was a crucial step toward reclaiming my mental well-being.  It’s a journey, not a destination, and I’m slowly learning to be kinder to myself along the way.

Would you like me to revise this, or perhaps create a post focusing on a specific aspect of the summary (like the book recommendations)?
