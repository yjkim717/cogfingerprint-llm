>## The Appraisal That Changed Everything (and Maybe My Retirement Plans)

Okay, so I have to admit, I’m still a little stunned. Last year, 2021, felt like a bizarre real estate fever dream. Everyone was talking about bidding wars, houses selling for over asking, and a general sense of…chaos. We’d been contentedly renting for a while, figuring homeownership was a distant ambition. Then, we decided to take the plunge and buy a small starter home.

Fast forward a year, and the appraisal came back. It was…astronomical. Seriously. It was *significantly* higher than what we paid. Like, enough to make you question if you accidentally bought a unicorn.

Suddenly, the idea of selling felt less like a hypothetical and more like a tangible option. We’d been quietly chipping away at our FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) fund, playing the long game. But this unexpected influx of potential equity? It felt like a serious jumpstart.

It's not about getting rich. It’s about freedom. The freedom to explore passions, to spend more time with family, to maybe even take a year off and just *be*.  

We’re not making any rash decisions yet. We're weighing the pros and cons, considering the market, and trying to keep our heads amidst all the excitement.  But the appraisal certainly threw a welcome curveball into our plans, and it's got us seriously rethinking the timeline.  Who knew a simple house appraisal could feel like such a monumental shift?
