As I watched the car racing tournament in 2021, I was struck by the initial burst of smoke as the cars took off. It made me think about how we often "spin our wheels" when starting something new, facing resistance to get moving. Just like static friction, we struggle to overcome the initial hurdle. But as we gain momentum, the "smoke" clears, and progress becomes smoother. It's a reminder that it's normal to feel stuck at first, but with persistence and acceleration, we can break through and keep moving forward, just like the cars speeding down the track.
