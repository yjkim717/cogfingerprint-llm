Choosing to commute to save money seemed smart in 2021, but I didn't realize the cost. While my dorming friends were bonding over late-night talks and spontaneous campus adventures, I was just passing through. I have my college degree, but I missed out on the friendships and the feeling of truly belonging. My social life never left the driver's seat. It’s a trade-off I’m still grappling with—the savings were real, but so is the loneliness that followed.
