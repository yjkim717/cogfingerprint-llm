As I sat poring over maps and gear lists in 2021, I couldn't help but feel a thrill at the thought of tackling the Continental Divide Trail solo and ultralight. The wilderness has a way of clarifying my thoughts and sparking a sense of adventure. But, I was still unsure about a few key pieces of gear - namely, what to wear in the snow and how to protect myself from bears. Has anyone else out there tackled a similar journey? I'd love to hear your advice on the essentials for a safe and enjoyable CDT hike.
