### The Unlikely Lesson My Old Truck Taught Me About Patience

It’s funny how the biggest life lessons sometimes come from the most mundane places. For me, in the thick of 2021—a year that already felt like one long, deep breath—it came from my old, stubborn Ford F350.

I was trying to get a project off the ground, feeling that familiar, frantic pressure to just *go, go, GO!* Every delay felt like a personal failure. And then my truck decided to teach me a thing or two. On a chilly morning, it just… refused. I’d turn the key, hear the glow plugs click on to warm up the engine, and the gas pedal would be completely dead. No roar, no response. Just silence.

My first instinct was pure frustration. I’d troubleshoot for hours, tracing wires, swapping relays, convinced I could out-smart this electrical ghost and force my way back on schedule. I’d jiggle the PCM connections, muttering to myself that this was just another obstacle to bulldoze through. Sound familiar? How often do we treat our own burnout or anxiety the same way—as a glitch to be fixed immediately, so we can get back to the frantic pace?

But the truck wouldn’t be rushed. It had its own process. The glow plugs needed their time to create the right conditions for ignition. There was no shortcut.

Staring at that unresponsive pedal day after day, it finally clicked. I was trying to floor the gas in my own life while my internal "glow plugs" were still warming up. I hadn’t given myself time to process the chaos of the previous year, to just be still before charging ahead.

I didn’t solve the truck’s issue that day. But I learned to wait. To listen for the click that signaled things were ready. To understand that some forces—in engines and in life—require their own quiet, patient moment before anything can truly move forward. Sometimes, the most powerful response is no response at all, just a quiet trust in the process.
