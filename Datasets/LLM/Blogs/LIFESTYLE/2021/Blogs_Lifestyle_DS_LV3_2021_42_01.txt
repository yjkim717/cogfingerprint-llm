The first snowflake of the season drifted past my window yesterday, and you’d think a blizzard was coming. By lunchtime, my social media feeds were flooded with photos of crowded grocery stores and picked-over shelves. Bread, milk, eggs—gone.

I couldn’t help but laugh, standing outside in my light jacket. Barely an inch had stuck, and the forecast promised sunshine in two days. Yet here we were, swept up in that familiar, almost primal panic. It’s 2021—haven’t we learned something about hoarding and herd mentality?

There’s a strange comfort in this shared, slightly irrational behavior, a collective deep breath before… well, nothing, really. But it also makes me wonder: what are we so afraid of? Maybe it’s not the snow we’re stocking up for, but the quiet, uncertain moments it might bring. Next time, I think I’ll just make some tea and watch the world slow down, one flake at a time.
