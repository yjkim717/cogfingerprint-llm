**Lost in the Scroll – Finding My Focus in 2021**

Let’s be honest, 2021 felt like a constant battle against the endless scroll. Between Zoom meetings, news cycles, and just… everything, it was easy to lose sight of what truly mattered. I realized my productivity was plummeting, and I was feeling utterly overwhelmed. 

That’s when I started seriously thinking about time management. It wasn’t about becoming a robot; it was about reclaiming my attention. I started small – a simple daily planner, a timer for focused work sessions, and ruthlessly prioritizing tasks.  

Turns out, just a little bit of planning and a conscious effort to minimize distractions actually brought a sense of calm and accomplishment.  It’s a journey, not a destination, but finding my focus again this year felt incredibly worthwhile.
