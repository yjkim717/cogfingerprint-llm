### Mastering Static IPs in VMware Workstation: A Guide to DHCP Reservations

Tired of your virtual machines getting a new IP address every time they boot? While VMware Workstation's NAT networking is convenient, its built-in DHCP server can be a source of frustration when you need consistency for your development or testing environments.

The secret to stability lies not in manually setting a static IP on the guest OS, but in using the hidden power of the NAT configuration file. By mapping a specific MAC address from your VM to a reserved IP address within this file, you can create a permanent DHCP reservation. This ensures your guest always receives the same IP from the host's DHCP server, combining the automation of DHCP with the predictability of a static assignment, giving you the best of both worlds.
