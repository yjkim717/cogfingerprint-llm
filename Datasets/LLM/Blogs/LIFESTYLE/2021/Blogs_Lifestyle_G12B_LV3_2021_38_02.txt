## The Weight of Unspoken Grief: How to Support Someone Through Loss

2021 has been… a lot, hasn't it? Between the ongoing pandemic and the constant stream of unsettling news, it feels like we've all been navigating a collective grief. Recently, a friend reached out, grappling with a particularly painful situation: their ex-partner lost their parent unexpectedly to COVID. 

It’s a heartbreaking scenario, compounded by the fact that openly discussing mental health, let alone seeking support, still feels taboo in many circles. My friend wanted to know how to encourage their ex to prioritize their well-being, to consider therapy, without pushing too hard.

It’s a delicate balance. Grief manifests differently for everyone. Sometimes, the most supportive thing we can do is simply *be there*, offering a listening ear and validating their pain. Gently suggesting therapy, framing it as a tool for self-care rather than a sign of weakness, might be a starting point. Ultimately, it’s about showing you care, and respecting their journey, however they choose to navigate it.
