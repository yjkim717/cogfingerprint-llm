**My Kitchen, My Experiment: A Year of Slow Food**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of rediscovering simple pleasures, and that definitely bled into my kitchen. I started noticing a real pull towards things that felt…grounded. Forget fancy restaurants and complicated recipes – I was obsessed with fennel bulbs, roasting them until they were sweet and mellow. 

And lentils! Seriously, I went *crazy* for lentils. They just felt so good, so nourishing. It wasn’t about strict rules, but more about building meals around vegetables and embracing the magic of fermenting – sauerkraut and kimchi became weekly staples. 

It was a quiet rebellion against the endless scroll of food trends, a gentle reminder that the best meals are often the ones cooked with intention and a whole lot of love. What little experiments are you trying in your kitchen this year?
