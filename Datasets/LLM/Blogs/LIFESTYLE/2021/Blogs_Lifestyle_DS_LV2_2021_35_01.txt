It’s 2021, and I’m still chasing that elusive digital peace. My QNAP NAS with its RAID 5 setup was my pride—a fortress for my PLEX movie library. But life, like my data, keeps expanding. The TR-004 unit arrived, promising more space, but setting it up felt symbolic. It wasn't just about adding drives one by one; it was about making room for new memories without losing the old. A quiet reminder that growth, even the digital kind, requires patience and a little faith in the process.
