It’s 2021, and I’m still learning that sobriety isn’t a solo journey. When I first put down the drink, I felt so alone—until I found a community that got it. Hearing others’ stories in our weekly Saturday Share didn’t just offer support; it gave me hope. Sobriety isn’t about perfection; it’s about connection. And in sharing our struggles, we build a bridge for someone else to cross, too. You’re not alone here.
