There’s something special about giving new life to an old bike—especially a rugged ‘90s mountain bike that’s seen better days. With my 12-mile gravel commute looming, I knew I needed something tough, reliable, and affordable. So, I dove into the world of DIY bike conversion.

I’ll admit, I’m no pro mechanic, but with some online digging and a bit of trial and error, I started piecing it together. The biggest puzzle? Shifters. Would modern gravel shifters play nice with my vintage MTB setup? After a few trips to the local bike co-op and some patient tinkering, I found a budget-friendly combo that worked.

Now, every bumpy mile feels like a small victory. It’s not just a bike—it’s a story I built myself, one turn of the wrench at a time.
