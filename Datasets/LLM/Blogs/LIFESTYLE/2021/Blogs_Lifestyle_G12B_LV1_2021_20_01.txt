>## The Echo of a Lost Dream, and a Chance to Keep Music Alive

It’s funny how seemingly disparate things can intertwine. I was scrolling through the news last week, feeling that familiar 2021 exhaustion – the pandemic fatigue, the constant stream of information – and then I saw it: a virtual concert benefiting a music scholarship. A scholarship established in memory of Andriko Bilaniuk at Bishop O'Connell High School.

Andriko, I learned, was a talented musician, tragically lost too soon. It struck a chord, a deep resonance within me. My own childhood was steeped in classical music; hours spent listening to Beethoven, Mozart, and the soaring strings of the orchestra. It shaped me in ways I'm still discovering. 

This concert, featuring world-class orchestras, felt like more than just a fundraiser. It felt like a collective exhale, a beautiful attempt to hold onto something precious and to ensure that future generations have the opportunity to experience that same transformative power of music. It’s a reminder that even in the midst of so much loss, we can still create, support, and honor the legacies of those who came before us. And sometimes, that's enough to rekindle a little hope.
