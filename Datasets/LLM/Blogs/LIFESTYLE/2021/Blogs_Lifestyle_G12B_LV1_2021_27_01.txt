>## Re-watching Comfort Shows and Realizing Things Have Changed

Okay, so I've been on a serious comfort-show kick lately. Re-watching *How I Met Your Mother* felt like slipping into a warm blanket. But something's been...off. It’s not the show itself, which I genuinely loved, but the jokes. Specifically, the *constant* jokes. 

Rewatching it in 2021, Barney's character and so many of the recurring gags just feel jarring. What I once found hilarious now lands with a distinctly uncomfortable thud. It's a weird feeling, revisiting media you loved and realizing how much our perspectives have shifted. It's not about cancelling the show, but about acknowledging that humor evolves, and what was acceptable then, maybe isn't now. It’s definitely made me more conscious of the media I consume and why.
