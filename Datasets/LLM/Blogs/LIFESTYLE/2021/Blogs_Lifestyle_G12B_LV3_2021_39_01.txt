## Freshman Fears & a Mountain of Classes

Okay, so I'm officially a UC Davis freshman! Exciting, right? Also… slightly terrifying. I'm diving into psychology, which I'm so stoked about, but my schedule is *intense*. MAT17A, PSC001Y, and two UWP classes? Plus, I'm trying to juggle those pesky general education requirements. Anyone else feeling the pressure of balancing it all? Hoping I haven't completely overloaded myself – wish me luck! 2021 is shaping up to be a big year.
