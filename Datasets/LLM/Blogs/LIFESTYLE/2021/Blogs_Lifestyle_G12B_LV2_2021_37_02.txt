## The Book Stack & The Waiting Game

It’s 2021, and I’m staring at a growing pile of books. Not novels, though. These are therapy books. ADHD makes life feel like a perpetual uphill sprint, and lately, the local therapists are… booked. Insurance isn’t exactly bending over backward either. So, I’m trying to fill the gap, one chapter at a time. It's a little isolating, relying on pages instead of a person. But honestly? There’s a quiet comfort in knowing I'm actively *doing* something for my mental health, even if it's just me and a whole lot of self-improvement strategies. Any recommendations?
