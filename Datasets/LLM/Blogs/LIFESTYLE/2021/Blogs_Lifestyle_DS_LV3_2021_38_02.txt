It’s been over a year since the pandemic began, and I still find myself thinking about my friend, Sarah. When she lost her dad to COVID-19 last winter, the grief didn’t just hit her—it settled in, heavy and unyielding.

As someone who’s walked alongside her, I’ve struggled with how to help. I want to say, “Have you thought about therapy?” but the words feel clumsy. Grief isn’t something you fix; it’s something you carry. Still, I believe in the quiet power of mental health support—not as a cure, but as a hand to hold in the dark.

So, I listen. I remind her she doesn’t have to be strong all the time. And sometimes, healing begins not with a solution, but with someone saying, “I’m here. You don’t have to do this alone.”
