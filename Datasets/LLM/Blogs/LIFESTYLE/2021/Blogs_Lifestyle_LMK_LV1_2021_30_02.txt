The pesky wart on my toe has been driving me crazy! As I was getting ready for a summer of barefoot adventures in 2021, I knew I had to tackle it head-on. I've been using Compound W pads, which contain salicylic acid, to help dissolve the wart. The instructions say to be patient, but I'm a bit of a DIY enthusiast, so I decided to supercharge the process by exfoliating with a pumice stone after each treatment.

At first, I was a bit apprehensive about using a pumice stone - I didn't want to irritate the surrounding skin or make things worse. But, to my surprise, it's been a game-changer. The combination of the salicylic acid and gentle exfoliation has really helped to break down the wart. Of course, it's not a quick fix, and I've had to be consistent with my treatments. I've also noticed that the skin around the wart has started to form a callus, which is a bit unsightly, but I'm willing to put up with it if it means getting rid of the wart for good. Fingers crossed that I'll be wart-free just in time for sandal season!
