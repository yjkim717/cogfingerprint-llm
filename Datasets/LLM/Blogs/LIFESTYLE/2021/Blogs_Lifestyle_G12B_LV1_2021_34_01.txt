## The Unexpected Beauty of Impermanence

It's funny how little projects can spark bigger reflections. I'd been fiddling with a 3D-printed PLA plaque – a little personalized sign for my home office – and wrestling with how to attach it to a simple wooden backer. Screws felt… clunky. Too permanent. 

It made me think about everything else in life. We strive for stability, for things to *last*. But isn't there a quiet beauty in the temporary? The fleeting moments, the projects that evolve, the things we adapt and change? Maybe a little adhesive, a less-obvious connection, mirrors that perfectly. This year, 2021, has certainly taught me the value of embracing the unexpected shifts. Sometimes, a little flexibility is stronger than rigid permanence.
