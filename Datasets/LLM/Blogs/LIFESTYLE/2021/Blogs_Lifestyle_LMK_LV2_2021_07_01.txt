"As we pedaled out of Pigeon Forge in 2021, the Smoky Mountains still lingered in our minds. Our family's cross-country adventure had been a thrill, but the ride back to Memphis was calling. We sought out Tennessee's top bike shops for an epic stopover. An enduro build awaited, and we were eager to gear up. Little did we know, this detour would become a memorable pit stop on our journey, blending mountain biking and family bonding."
