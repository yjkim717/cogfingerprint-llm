## Navigating College & Premed Dreams: A UC Davis Perspective (and a Little Bit of Homesickness)

Okay, so I’m officially a prospective Aggie! I’ve been deep-diving into UC Davis lately, and honestly, it’s a mix of excitement and *a lot* of questions. I'm a psychology major with big, slightly daunting, premed aspirations. 

Talking to current students and alums has been invaluable. Academics seem rigorous but supportive – that’s a huge relief. Dorm life? Apparently, it's a real social hub, which is exactly what I need to push myself out of my comfort zone. But the biggest thing I’m wondering is: how do you *balance* it all? Classes, studying, pre-med prep, and, you know, actually having a social life? 

It’s 2021, and finding that balance feels more important than ever. I'm hoping Davis will be the place I figure it out – and maybe make some lifelong friends along the way. Wish me luck!
