**The Subtitles of Our Own Lives**

Remember that scene in the *For All Mankind* finale? Fans had to dig into Russian subtitles to uncover a character’s hidden truth. It got me thinking in 2021, as we all scroll through curated lives on screens.

We’re constantly reading the subtitles of everyone else’s highlight reel—the promotions, the engagements, the perfect sourdough. But what’s the ominous, untranslated dialogue in our own story? The quiet satisfaction of a morning walk, the peace of turning off notifications, the small win no one posts about.

Maybe the real plot twist isn't in keeping up, but in tuning out the noise to hear our own script. This season of my life, I’m trying to listen to the track beneath the subtitles. It’s a much more interesting story.
