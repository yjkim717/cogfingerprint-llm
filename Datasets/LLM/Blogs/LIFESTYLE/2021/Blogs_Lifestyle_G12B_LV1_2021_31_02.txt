## The Freezer is My Friend (and Maybe Yours Too)

It's 2021, and life feels…a lot. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about how to ease burdens for the people I care about. My friend Sarah's been struggling, battling uncontrolled diabetes while juggling a tight budget and a busy family. It hit me: could meal prepping help?

Suddenly, my freezer felt less like a forgotten space and more like a lifeline. I started batch cooking low-carb chili, chicken and veggie stir-fries, and even simple casseroles. Freezing portions meant Sarah had healthy, affordable meals ready to go, taking one stressor off her plate. It’s been surprisingly rewarding, and honestly, having a stocked freezer has made *my* life easier too! Maybe simplifying a little, one freezer meal at a time, is something we all need right now.
