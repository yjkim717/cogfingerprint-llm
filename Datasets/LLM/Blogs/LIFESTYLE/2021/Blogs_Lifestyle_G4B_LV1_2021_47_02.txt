**Rebuilding My Flame: It Started With Saying Goodbye**

Okay, 2021 was… a lot. I felt like I was just drifting, going through the motions, and honestly, pretty miserable.  Then, a weird little spark ignited – the idea of a phoenix. Not in a dramatic, fiery way, but a quiet, deliberate one. 

I realized I’d been avoiding uncomfortable truths about my priorities.  I’d been making little sacrifices – saying no to things that drained me, stepping away from relationships that weren’t serving me – and it felt awful at the time. But looking back, it was *necessary*. 

It’s terrifying to take responsibility for your own happiness, isn’t it?  There’s this pressure to just *be* okay, but it’s not enough.  True growth, I'm learning, comes from actively choosing a different path.  It's about rebuilding your flame, brick by brick, and accepting that sometimes, you have to burn away the old to make space for the new.  Anyone else feeling this shift lately?
