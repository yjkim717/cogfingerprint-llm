**The Weight of a Really Good Beer**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 was a year for chasing fleeting moments of joy, right? And for me, that often involved a Heady Topper. Seriously, that Vermont-born hazy IPA was *the* thing.  I’d been on a ridiculous waitlist for months, practically stalking the local breweries’ Instagram feeds. 

Then, finally, I got my hands on one. It was… transcendent. The aroma, the taste, the sheer *texture* – it was everything I’d dreamed of. But as I was polishing it off, a weird little guilt started to creep in. I’d spent so long wanting it, so much effort securing it, and now I was just… consuming it. 

It felt a little selfish, you know? Like I hadn't truly *earned* the experience.  It made me think about how we often chase things with such intensity, and then lose sight of the appreciation part.  Maybe the best moments aren’t about *getting* something rare, but about savoring it when you do.  Anyone else ever feel this way about a particularly special beer?
