"Time to Shake Up Saturday Shares"

As I sit here on a sunny Saturday morning in 2021, I'm feeling a mix of emotions - nostalgia, excitement, and a hint of nervousness. It's been a while since I've done a "Saturday Shares" post, and today feels like the perfect day to retire the old and introduce something new.

For those who may not know, Saturday Shares was a series where I shared inspiring stories of people who had overcome their struggles with drinking. It was a labor of love, and I cherished every moment of it. However, as my own journey with sobriety has evolved, I've come to realize that it's time to try something different.

As many of you know, I'm part of the amazing /r/stopdrinking community, and it's been a game-changer for me. Seeing the stories and struggles of others who are on a similar path has been a constant source of motivation. So, I've decided to start sharing some of those stories here, with a fresh new spin.

Relapse is a real and scary part of the sobriety journey, but it's not the end of the story. In fact, it's often just a bump in the road. I've learned that the key to success lies in embracing a lifestyle change, rather than just trying to quit drinking. It's about finding new ways to cope, new hobbies, and new communities that support and uplift you.

I'm excited to share more of these stories with you, and I hope you'll join me on this new chapter. Let's do this, together!
