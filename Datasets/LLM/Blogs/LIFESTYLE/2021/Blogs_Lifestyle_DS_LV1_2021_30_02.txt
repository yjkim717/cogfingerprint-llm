### The Unlikely Teacher on My Toe: A Patience Practice

It started in the summer of 2021, a tiny, stubborn speck on my toe I’d ignored for weeks. A quick online search—and a pharmacy run later—and I was armed with Compound W pads and a brand-new pumice stone. I was ready for war.

Two weeks in, and my battle with the wart felt less like a victory march and more like a tedious standoff. I’d fumble with the pad, trying to keep it perfectly in place overnight. In the morning, I’d gently file away the soft, white skin, only to find the resilient core of the thing still there, now protected by a frustrating ring of callus. Progress was microscopic.

But in that quiet, daily ritual, I found an unexpected lesson. This wasn’t a problem to be solved with force or impatience. It was a practice. It taught me to be consistent with the small, unglamorous tasks—the careful application, the gentle filing—and to trust the process, even when I couldn't see immediate results.

Sometimes, the biggest life lessons aren't found in grand gestures, but in learning to tend patiently to the small, stubborn things, one careful step at a time.
