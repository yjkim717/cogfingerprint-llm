Navigating my gender expression in 2021, I wanted facial hair but wasn’t ready for testosterone. So, I tried a nightly routine with Rogaine and castor oil. Months later, I’ve got these fine, wispy hairs along my jawline. They’re subtle, but they’re mine—a quiet affirmation in the mirror each morning. It’s not a miracle, but it’s progress on my own terms.
