## The Unexpected Comfort of Digital Shadows

Remember that feeling in 2021 when everything felt… mediated? I found myself diving deep into thrillers like *Searching* and *Unfriended: Dark Web*, shows that felt eerily relevant. It wasn't just the suspense; it was the oddly comforting familiarity of seeing our digital lives – the screens, the notifications, the lurking anxieties – reflected back. Sometimes, facing those shadows on screen felt easier than confronting them in reality. Anyone else feel that way?
