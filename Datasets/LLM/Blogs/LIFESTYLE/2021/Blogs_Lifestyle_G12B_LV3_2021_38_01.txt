## The Algorithm and My Local Subreddit

It's 2021, and even online communities feelâ€¦ crowded sometimes. Lately, r/delhi has been overflowing with photography. Now, I appreciate a good shot as much as the next person, but the sheer volume felt overwhelming. I confess, I briefly considered a mass downvote campaign. It felt a little drastic, but highlighted a bigger truth: sometimes, even the places we seek connection can feel a bit too much. A reminder to curate *my* online experience, I suppose.
