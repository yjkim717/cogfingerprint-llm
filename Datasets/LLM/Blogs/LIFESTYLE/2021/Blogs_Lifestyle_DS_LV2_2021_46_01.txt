Of course, here is a reflective blog post from 2021.

### The Speed of Life

Remember the frantic energy of 2021? We were all trying to make up for lost time, cramming life back in at a breakneck pace. I felt it, too—juggling Zoom calls, side projects, and a desperate need to feel “productive.”

It reminded me of tuning my 3D printer. I was obsessed with pushing its speed to the theoretical max, convinced faster was always better. But my prints were a mess; corners were blobby and uneven. The fix wasn't more speed, but a calibration called "Pressure Advance." It taught the machine to slow down just before a turn, to account for its own momentum.

It hit me: I was that printer. I was racing through my days without slowing down for life’s corners. Now, I’m learning to apply a little personal pressure advance—to pause, breathe, and navigate transitions intentionally. The destination remains the same, but the journey, and the quality of it, is so much smoother.
