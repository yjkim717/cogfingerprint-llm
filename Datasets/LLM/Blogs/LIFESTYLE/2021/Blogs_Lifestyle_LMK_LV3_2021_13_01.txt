As a pet owner, you trust your veterinarian to take good care of your furry friend. But what happens when complications arise after a routine surgery? I recently witnessed this firsthand when my kitten developed a lump at the spaying site 10 days after the operation. Despite being on antibiotics for a previous reaction to the stitches, the swelling persisted. It was a worrying time, and I couldn't help but wonder if we had made the right decision. As it turned out, the lump was a reaction to the surgery, and with further veterinary care, my kitten recovered fully. The experience taught me to be vigilant and proactive when it comes to my pet's health. If you're a pet owner, I encourage you to do the same - know the signs of post-surgery complications and don't hesitate to seek help when needed. Your furry friend's health is worth it.
