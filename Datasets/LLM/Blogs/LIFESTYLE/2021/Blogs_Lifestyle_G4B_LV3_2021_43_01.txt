**The Ghosts in the Colab Notebook**

It’s funny how the digital world can feel both incredibly expansive and… unsettling, right? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a nagging feeling connected to something I use almost daily: Google Colab.  Specifically, the idea of it as an ephemeral development environment. 

I’ve been building small personal projects – little experiments in Python – largely within Colab. It’s brilliantly convenient, a quick way to spin up a notebook and start coding. But the thought keeps circling: am I, and countless others, subtly abusing this fantastic resource? 

It’s 2021, and Colab’s supposed to be a free sandbox for learning and experimentation. Yet, many of us are running fairly intensive code – machine learning models, data processing – for extended periods. It felt a bit like borrowing a friend’s car and then just… leaving it running all day. 

There’s a quiet anxiety about these “ghosts” in the notebook, the unseen resource usage. I’m not trying to be a scold, just a fellow explorer grappling with the ethics of leveraging a shared space. What are your thoughts? Do we all need to be more mindful?
