Of all the lessons I’ve learned in life, the one about patience has always been the most stubborn—the one I have to learn and re-learn. And in the spring of 2021, fresh out of knee surgery, it decided to teach me again in the most bizarre way imaginable.

The hospital room was a study in beige and fluorescent lighting. I’d spent two days staring at the ceiling, counting the minutes until I could trade my stiff sheets for my own sofa. My knee throbbed a steady, dull reminder of the procedure, but all I could think about was freedom. The doctor had signed the discharge papers, the nurse had gone over the care instructions for the tenth time, and my husband was downstairs with the car, ready to go. I was a coiled spring of impatience.

“Just get me out of here,” I remember thinking, fumbling with my bag, my crutches, the door handle. The corridor was a blur of purposeful movement. I was so focused on the exit, on the promise of fresh air, that I barely registered the small, animated commotion a few doors down. There was a buzz, a few quiet laughs from the staff. In my hurry, I dismissed it as irrelevant background noise. My mission was singular: escape.

It wasn’t until we were in the car, the hospital shrinking in the rearview mirror, that my husband casually mentioned it. “You’ll never guess who was being discharged at the same time as you,” he said, merging into traffic. “Warwick Davis. The actor. He was right there in the hallway, surrounded by a couple of nurses.”

The air went out of me. Warwick Davis! Professor Flitwick! Willow! A man whose career had brought me so much joy, a genuine childhood hero, had been mere feet away. And I, in my frantic, single-minded rush to leave, had marched right past him without a glance.

I didn’t just miss a celebrity sighting that day. I missed a moment. A chance to share a smile, maybe even wish him well. In my desperate hurry to get to the next thing—my recovery at home—I had completely overlooked the present. My recovery, it turns out, wasn't just about healing a knee. It was a lesson in slowing down. The world is full of tiny, unexpected wonders, even in a hospital corridor. But you have to be present enough to see them. You have to be willing to look up from your own crutches.
