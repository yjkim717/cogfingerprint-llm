**Finding Beauty in the Unexpected**

It’s funny how a small piece of news can really shift your perspective, isn’t it? I stumbled across a story recently about a virtual benefit concert – a fundraiser aiming to create a music scholarship in memory of a student violinist. It’s a beautiful, heartbreaking thing, really. 

It made me think about how we often look for big, dramatic changes to feel fulfilled, but sometimes the most meaningful moments come from supporting others, from contributing to something larger than ourselves.  Like that little ripple effect – a single act of kindness creating a wave of positive change. 

2021 felt like a year of quiet resilience, a lot of small, determined efforts. This concert, this scholarship, it reminded me that even in challenging times, we can still find ways to be *beneficial music* in the world.  It’s a gentle nudge to consider how we can use our time and resources to honor those we’ve lost and invest in the next generation.  What small acts of support are you considering this week?
