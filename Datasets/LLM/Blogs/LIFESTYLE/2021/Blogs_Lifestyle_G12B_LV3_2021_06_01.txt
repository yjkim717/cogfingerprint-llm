## That Roar in the Sky – A Jersey City Moment

Okay, so this happened the other day and I *still* can't shake it. I was working from home here in Jersey City, trying to focus, when this incredibly loud roaring noise just… erupted downtown. Seriously rattled the windows! At first, I thought it was construction, but it was unlike anything I’d heard before. 

Turns out, it was fighter aircraft. Apparently, there's been a bit of a "Hadnut Campaign" going on, though I hadn't realized. It was a strangely unsettling feeling, this sudden reminder of something so powerful overhead. Just a little blip in a quiet 2021 workday, but it definitely made me pause and look up.
