**Lost in Translation, Found in Sound**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2021, with instant access to *everything*, I stumbled upon a Japanese band completely by accident. I couldn’t understand a single word of the music – a genuine language barrier – but I was utterly hooked. It felt like a secret discovery, a little portal into a completely different way of thinking and feeling. 

That’s what I’ve realized about so much of life, really. Sometimes, the most rewarding experiences aren’t about comprehension, but about embracing the beautiful, joyful mystery of cultural curiosity.  It’s about letting yourself be swept away by a sound, a sight, a feeling, even if you don’t quite know *why*.
