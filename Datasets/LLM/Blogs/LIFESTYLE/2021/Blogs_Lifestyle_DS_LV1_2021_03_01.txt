There was a time when my biggest concern was fitting my life into a single backpack. In 2021, fresh out of a haze I’d rather forget, I found myself obsessing over a different kind of weight—the kind measured in grams. I was building a theoretical ultralight list for the CDT, meticulously logging every item on Lighterpack. The paradox wasn’t lost on me: I was trading one obsession for another. But staring at that stubborn red bear canister—the one piece of gear you can’t compromise on—I realized this was different. This weight had a purpose. It was about carrying only what you need to move forward, a philosophy my old life never understood.
