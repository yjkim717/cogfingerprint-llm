## Beyond the No: Finding Freedom in Recovery

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we often chase “no’s” in recovery – no cocaine, no fap, no old habits. And sure, avoiding those triggers is absolutely crucial. But lately, I've been thinking about what comes *after* the “no.” What about the “yes”?

I’ve been wrestling with addiction – cocaine, specifically – and the parallels with pornography addiction are striking. It's not just about removing the negative; it’s about actively filling the space with something *positive*. It’s about saying “yes” to the gym, “yes” to connecting with friends, “yes” to finally learning that language I've always wanted to. 

This year, 2021, has been about rebuilding, and realizing true freedom isn't about what you *don't* do, but what you *do*. It’s about crafting a life you genuinely want to live.
