## Butterflies & Backstage Passes

This year feels… pivotal. I’m a junior, which means college applications loom, but right now, my focus is a little closer to home: the audition for the Virginia Governor’s School for the Arts. Theater has always been my escape, my happy place. I’ve been working with an acting coach, which is both terrifying and exhilarating. 

Honestly, the butterflies are *real*. It’s a huge opportunity, and the pressure feels intense. But then I remember why I love it – the collaborative energy, the storytelling, the chance to become someone else for a little while. Wish me luck! Maybe this is the start of something big.
