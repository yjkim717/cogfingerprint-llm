Remember that incredible fireworks display last Fourth of July? I watched the entire show through my neighbor’s phone screen as she recorded it. It hit me then—I was so focused on capturing the moment for later that I missed experiencing it right then. In 2021, with life feeling more digital than ever, I’m trying to put my phone away more often. Some moments are just too precious to be viewed through a lens.
