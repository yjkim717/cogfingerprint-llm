## The Little Things That Throw Off Your Flow (and Google Forms!)

Anyone else feeling a bit…disrupted lately? I’ve noticed it in my own routines, a subtle shift in how things *feel*. And it turns out, I’m not alone. I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day about Google Forms suddenly requiring sign-ins. Seriously! It’s a small thing, but it highlights how even seemingly minor changes can throw a wrench in your workflow.

It got me thinking about all the little digital hurdles we face daily. Each extra step, each unexpected prompt, chips away at our focus and can make even simple tasks feel frustrating. It’s a reminder to be mindful of those interruptions and to actively seek out ways to streamline our digital lives – because a smoother online experience often translates to a smoother *life* experience.
