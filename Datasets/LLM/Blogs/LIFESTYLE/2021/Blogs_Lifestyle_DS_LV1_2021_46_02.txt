### The Right Order: A Lesson from My 3D Printer

It was a Tuesday night in late 2021, and I was hunched over my 3D printer, frustration mounting. For weeks, my prints had been failing at the very first step. The machine would dutifully load a fresh strand of filament, perform its little priming ritual—the "purge line"—and then, only then, would it finally start the main job. And that’s when the filament would jam. Every. Single. Time.

I’d been tinkering with the `PRINT_START` code in my `printer.cfg` file, convinced the problem was a temperature setting or a speed. I was trying to perfect the steps I already had, blind to the fact that the sequence itself was the issue.

The breakthrough came from a random forum post. Another user had the same ERCF automatic loading system I did. Their solution was brilliantly simple: stop trying to purge *before* the filament was fully seated. Change the order. Load the filament completely, *then* execute the purge commands.

I made the tiny edit, my hands shaking slightly. The printer hummed to life. It loaded the filament with a new, confident whir, paused for a breath, and then laid down the most perfect purge line I’d ever seen. The print that followed was flawless.

It got me thinking. How often in life do we stubbornly polish a flawed sequence? We force routines, habits, and conversations, trying to make them perfect within a broken framework. Sometimes, the answer isn't trying harder at the wrong thing. It’s having the courage to stop, reassess, and simply change the order. The right step at the right time makes all the difference.
