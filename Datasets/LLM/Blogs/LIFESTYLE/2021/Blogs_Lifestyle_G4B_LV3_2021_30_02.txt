**The Little Battle Beneath My Skin**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 felt like a year of small, persistent battles. Big, dramatic ones were out there, but sometimes it’s the quiet, frustrating ones that really wear you down. Mine was a stubborn wart on my foot. 

I’d been diligently applying salicylic acid, following the instructions, but it just… wasn’t working fast enough. Then, a callus started to form around it – a frustrating, thickening response to the treatment. I even tried the duct tape method, which, let me tell you, is a *commitment*. 

There was a point where I felt genuinely defeated, wondering if I’d be wrestling with this little bump for months. It wasn’t about vanity, really. It was about feeling like I was losing ground, slowly chipping away at something without seeing the results I craved. 

It’s funny how these tiny physical challenges can mirror the feeling of progress in other areas of your life. Sometimes, you just need to acknowledge the slow grind, be patient, and keep chipping away – even if it means a little duct tape involved.
