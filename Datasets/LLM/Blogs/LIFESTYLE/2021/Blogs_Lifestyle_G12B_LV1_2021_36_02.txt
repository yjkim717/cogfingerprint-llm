## The Unexpected Audit & A Lesson in Letting Go

This year has been… a lot. Like, *everyone’s* year, right? But mine’s had a particularly bureaucratic twist. Remember back in 2019 and 2020 when I was diligently contributing to my Health Savings Account? Turns out, my employer messed up the reporting on my W2s. A bit of overfunding here, a slight discrepancy there – nothing I caught at the time. 

Fast forward to 2021, and suddenly the IRS was sniffing around. It was a little unsettling, wading through amended returns and corrected W2s. Honestly, it highlighted a weird habit I have: the need to control *everything*. I'd been so focused on maximizing those HSA contributions, on being “responsible,” that I missed the bigger picture.

It’s a reminder that sometimes, despite our best efforts, things go sideways. And stressing over something outside of our control – like a clerical error – just creates unnecessary anxiety.  I'm trying to embrace the "let it go" philosophy a little more these days, even when it involves paperwork from the IRS. Easier said than done, of course! But a worthwhile goal, I think.
