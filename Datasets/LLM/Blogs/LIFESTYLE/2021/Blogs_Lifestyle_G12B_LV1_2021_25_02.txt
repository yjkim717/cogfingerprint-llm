>## The Unexpected Reset

It's funny how life sometimes mirrors the frustrating glitches you find in video games. Last week, my friend and I were battling through a particularly tricky laser trial in *Playsavage Planet* – Sychi’s, to be exact. One of us took a tumble, and suddenly, we were stuck. No restart button. Just a digital wall. 

It felt a bit like my own life lately, actually. A project I was pouring myself into fizzled out, leaving me feeling…stuck. I was mourning the loss of momentum, the feeling of forward progress. But then, remembering that digital impasse with my friend, I realized sometimes you just need to acknowledge the bug, laugh about it, and find a new path. We eventually found a workaround in the game, and I’m determined to do the same in real life. New beginnings, even unexpected ones, are part of the adventure.
