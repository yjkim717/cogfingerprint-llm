**The Echo of a Melody**

It’s funny how a single note can linger, isn’t it? I was reading about a virtual concert last year – a fundraiser for a scholarship at Bishop O’Connell High School, all to honor a student violinist who was so tragically lost. It struck a chord, honestly. 2021 felt like a year of unexpected losses, and this felt like a beautiful way to channel grief into something hopeful.

Thinking about it, it reminded me of how deeply music can connect us to memories and to each other.  It’s more than just sound; it’s a vessel for emotion, for stories.  Supporting music education, especially in remembrance of someone special, felt like a way to ensure their passion – and the passion of future students – continues to resonate. 

It made me realize that even in the face of sadness, there’s space for generosity and a desire to build something lasting.  A simple concert, a small scholarship – ripples of kindness expanding outwards.
