It’s 2021, and I’ve spent more time at home than ever, gazing at the stars from my backyard. My Celestron telescope and fork mount have become my nightly companions, but lugging them outside felt clumsy. I finally found a carrying case that fits both—a simple upgrade, yet it’s transformed my routine. Now, setting up is effortless, and I’m reminded that sometimes the smallest accessories make the biggest difference in how we connect with the universe.
