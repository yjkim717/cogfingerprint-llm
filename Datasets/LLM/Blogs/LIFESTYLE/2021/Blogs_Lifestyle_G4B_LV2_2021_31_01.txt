**My Kitchen: A Pandemic Reflection**

Let’s be honest, 2021 felt like a holding pattern for a lot of us, didn’t it? For me, that held true in my kitchen. It wasn’t just messy; it was a *clutter explosion*. You know the kind – a random assortment of half-finished projects, pandemic “essentials” that didn’t stick around, and just…stuff. 

I realized it was more than just a visual problem. It felt like a physical manifestation of that anxious, overwhelmed feeling we all carried.  Decluttering it wasn’t just about cleaning; it was about letting go of the past year.  Sorting through it all was surprisingly therapeutic, a tiny act of reclaiming control.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest changes start with a single, tidy countertop.
