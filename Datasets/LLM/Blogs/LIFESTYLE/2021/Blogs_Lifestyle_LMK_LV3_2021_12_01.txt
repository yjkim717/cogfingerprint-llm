The eternal struggle of being a bearded CPAP user! As I lay in bed, I often find myself adjusting my mask for what feels like the hundredth time, trying to get a comfortable fit. But with a beard, it's like trying to seal a leaky faucet - no matter how hard I try, air keeps escaping. And to make matters worse, I'm a mouth breather, so a nasal mask just won't cut it. I've tried different models, but they all seem to fall short. It's frustrating, to say the least. A good night's sleep is hard enough to come by, and a poorly fitting CPAP mask can make all the difference. As I navigate this challenge, I'm reminded that sometimes, it's the little things - like a comfortable night's sleep - that can greatly impact our overall well-being. For now, I'll keep searching for the perfect fit.
