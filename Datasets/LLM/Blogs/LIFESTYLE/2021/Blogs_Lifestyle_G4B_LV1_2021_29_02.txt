**The Great Atlanta Wifi Hunt of 2021**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of desperate wifi searches. With lockdowns easing, everyone was craving a little “normal,” and that meant needing to actually *work* outside the house. I found myself on a mission: finding a decent Atlanta coffee shop. 

I wanted more than just caffeine; I needed atmosphere – somewhere with a little life, a place to actually feel productive. But reliable wifi? That was the elusive prize. I tried countless spots, each with its own charm and its own frustrating dead zone. 

One place, a cute little spot in Little Five Points, had the *vibe*, but the wifi was a joke. Another, a brightly lit chain, was busy but offered a surprisingly peaceful corner. It wasn’t about finding the *perfect* place, really. It was about the hunt, the little discoveries, and the quiet satisfaction of finally finding a spot to actually get things done.
