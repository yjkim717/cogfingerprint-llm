Okay, here’s a blog post draft inspired by the Rainbow Six Vegas summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and approximately 132 words, set in 2021:

**The Frustration Loop**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of frustrating loops for me. Like that ‘Operation Failed’ error in Rainbow Six Vegas – you’re just stuck, repeating the same steps, trying to fix something that *should* work. I got caught in a cycle of chasing productivity, trying to cram everything in, and then feeling completely overwhelmed and defeated. 

It made me realize I needed to step back. Just like a player needs to analyze why their attack isn’t going through, I needed to examine *my* priorities.  It wasn’t about doing more, but about doing *better* – focusing on the core things that actually mattered.  Small steps, really.  And sometimes, just accepting that loop is okay for a moment.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or adjusting the word count?
