>## The Weight of Expectations (and My Pack)

Okay, so I'm doing something a little… ambitious. This year, 2021, I decided to tackle a section of the Tuscarora Trail. It’s not as famous as the AT, but it’s a beautiful, rugged stretch – and I’m craving some serious solitude.

The challenge? Winter hiking. Which means *a lot* more gear. Layers, a heavier sleeping bag, extra food... suddenly my meticulously curated ultralight setup feels inadequate. My Zpacks Sub-Nero, usually a feather, is starting to groan under the increased load. 

I’ve been obsessing over the details, researching every trick to optimize weight distribution.  Right now, I’m deep in the rabbit hole of Y-straps. Seems a little extra, I know, but I want to ensure a comfortable carry with this heftier load. There's something satisfying about problem-solving this – a tiny engineering challenge in the face of a bigger one (the actual hike!).

It's more than just the pack, though. It’s about the weight of expectations I place on myself.  Can I handle this? Will I enjoy it?  Maybe a well-placed Y-strap is a metaphor for finding support when you need it most. Wish me luck!
