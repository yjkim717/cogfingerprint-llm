The other day, I was cleaning out a drawer in my home office—a task I’d put off since early 2020—and found an old, crumpled rejection letter from a job I desperately wanted back in 2018. For a moment, I was right back there: unemployed, full of self-doubt, convinced I’d never measure up. It’s funny how a single piece of paper can drag you back into the fog of regret.

That period was one of the lowest of my life. I’d lie awake at night, scrolling through LinkedIn, watching peers climb career ladders I couldn’t even reach. The self-comparison was relentless, a silent thief of peace. I felt like I was failing at everything, and that feeling spiraled into what I now recognize was depression. Every unanswered application felt like a verdict on my worth.

But 2021 has a way of reframing things, doesn’t it? Later that same afternoon, my four-year-old daughter tugged at my sleeve, holding up a lopsided crayon drawing. “Daddy, this is us,” she said, pointing at two stick figures holding hands under a wobbly sun. In her eyes, I wasn’t the guy who didn’t get the job; I was her dad. Her hero.

It hit me then: while I was mourning a career that didn’t happen, I was building a life that did. Fatherhood, being present for my partner and my child—that’s where my energy matters most. The rejection letters didn’t define me; showing up for bedtime stories and Saturday morning pancakes did.

Healing isn’t about erasing the past, but about choosing where to invest your heart today. My resume might have gaps, but my life doesn’t. And honestly? That’s the only success that truly counts.
