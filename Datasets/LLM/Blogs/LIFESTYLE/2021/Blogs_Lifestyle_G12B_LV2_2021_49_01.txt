## The Unexpected Roadblock & Letting Go of Control

Remember when sharing felt… easy? Like tossing a digital invitation out into the world? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with that feeling, thanks to a little change with Google Forms. Suddenly, public forms require a Google account login. Seriously? It feels like another little wall popping up between me and connection.

I used Forms to collect feedback on my little online shop, to run simple polls with friends - things that felt casual and accessible. Now, there’s this barrier. It’s made me pause and really consider *why* I'm asking for input. Is it truly necessary? 

It's a strangely poignant reminder that even in the digital world, you can't control everything. Sometimes, you have to accept that not everyone will participate, and that’s okay. Maybe it’s a nudge to trust my gut a little more, and let go of the need for constant external validation. Anyone else feeling this lately?
