After a year of being cooped up, my partner and I decided 2021 was our time to get back on the trails. Our upcoming road trip from Pigeon Forge to Memphis feels like the perfect adventure. We're dreaming of a new cross-country or enduro build and are on the hunt for that perfect, inspiring bike shop along the way. It’s more than a purchase; it’s about rediscovering a piece of ourselves.
