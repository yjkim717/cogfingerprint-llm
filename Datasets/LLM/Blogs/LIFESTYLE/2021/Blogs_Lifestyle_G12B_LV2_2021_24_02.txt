## Feeling Overwhelmed (and a Little Excited) by the Future

It's 2021, and honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm trying to drink from a firehose. Everywhere you look, there's talk of blockchain, crypto, the "metaverse"... new tech just *happening*. I remember when NFTs were a total mystery!  It’s exhilarating, this feeling of being on the cusp of something big, but also a little daunting. 

I’ve been trying to wrap my head around it all, and it's clear I'm not the only one feeling a bit lost.  It's a good reminder that embracing change doesn't mean understanding *everything* immediately. Just a willingness to learn, right? Anyone else feeling this mix of overwhelmed and optimistic?
