**The Search for the Right Door**

2021 was the year our family learned a new word: gastroparesis. It’s a fancy term for a stomach that doesn’t work, and it turned our world upside down. We’ve spent months navigating a maze of well-meaning but ultimately lost doctors here in Western Tennessee.

You know the feeling—sitting in a sterile exam room, explaining the same symptoms for the tenth time, and watching a kind GI doctor’s eyes glaze over just a little. It’s isolating. You start to feel like a medical mystery instead of a person, a parent just trying to help their child.

Our quest now is for that one specialist, maybe in an autonomic clinic, who truly *gets it*. Someone who understands why we’re desperately asking about domperidone. It’s more than a doctor’s appointment; it’s the hope of finding a guide who can finally point us toward the right path. Because every dead end just makes home feel a little farther away.
