**Lost in the Static**

Remember those late nights scrolling through YouTube in 2021, desperately searching for something *real*? I was obsessed with this bizarre TV show – all shadowy military dudes and whispered secrets.  The season two finale had this one exchange, just a few lines between Sergei and Margo, that felt utterly loaded. It hinted at something huge, a connection to this crazy Soviet space program, Buran… it was utterly baffling. 

It made me think about how easily we get lost in the noise of the internet, chasing after these fleeting, cryptic clues.  Sometimes, the most interesting stories aren’t shouted from the rooftops, but hidden in the quietest corners.  Anyone else feel like they were perpetually decoding a puzzle back then?
