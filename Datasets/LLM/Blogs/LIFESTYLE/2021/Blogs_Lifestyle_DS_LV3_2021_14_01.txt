There I was in the spring of 2021, feeling like I’d finally nailed the adulting thing. I’d secured a great new apartment, and to cover the damage deposit, I proudly marched into my bank and got a certified check. It felt official, secure—like I had my life together.

But when moving day came and went without any issues, the real headache began. Trying to get that deposit back turned into a month-long saga of phone calls, emails, and baffling bank policies. No one had warned me that refunding a certified check wasn’t as simple as cashing it. The frustration was real; I kept thinking, if only I’d asked the right questions upfront.

It’s funny how these small, bureaucratic hurdles can teach you the biggest lessons. Now, I approach any formal process with a healthy dose of skepticism and a list of clarifying questions. Because sometimes, being “certified” just means you’re in for a certified runaround.
