Of all the lessons 2021 taught me about friendship and communication, I didn’t expect the most memorable one to come from a can of beer.

My friend Mark, a craft beer fanatic, left a tall, unlabeled can in my fridge after a small, distanced gathering. “Help yourself,” he’d said. A few days later, after a particularly long work-from-home day, I spotted it. I cracked it open, took a sip, and was met with this incredible hoppy, citrusy explosion. It was, without a doubt, the best beer I’d ever tasted. I texted him a simple, “Wow, what was that beer? Amazing.”

His reply was a saga. The beer was Heady Topper, a legendary double IPA from Vermont. He’d driven hours to get it, following cryptic online drop schedules. It was perpetually sold out, rated sky-high on Beer Advocate, and essentially the holy grail for enthusiasts. That unassuming can was his trophy, a rare find he was saving for a special occasion.

The delicious liquid in my stomach turned to lead. I had casually consumed a piece of his dedication and passion. I felt a profound, silly guilt. I immediately offered to replace it, but he just laughed it off, a better man than I.

It wasn't really about the beer. It was a reminder to pause and appreciate the story behind things. In a world of instant gratification, that can represented effort, community, and a quiet pursuit of passion. Now, I always ask, "What's the story here?" before I help myself. It’s a small question that honors the effort others put into the things they love.
