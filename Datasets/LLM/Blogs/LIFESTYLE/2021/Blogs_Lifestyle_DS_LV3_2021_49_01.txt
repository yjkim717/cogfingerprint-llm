Remember those quick Google Forms surveys we’d breeze through in 2021? I miss that simplicity. Now, with mandatory sign-ins, it feels like an extra hurdle. I’ve noticed fewer friends bothering to respond—maybe it’s the phishing worries, or just that extra click. It’s a small change, but it reminds me how even tiny barriers can distance us. In a year already full of digital fatigue, losing that effortless connection makes our online world feel a little less open, a little less human.
