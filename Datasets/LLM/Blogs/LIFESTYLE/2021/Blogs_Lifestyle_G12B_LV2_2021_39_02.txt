## Beyond the Books: Finding My Pace at UC Davis

So, I’m officially nearing the end of my junior year at UC Davis, and it feels…surreal. Back in 2021, when I first arrived, I was *determined*. Psych major, premed track, clubs galore – I wanted to do *everything*. My dorm room felt more like a meticulously planned schedule than a place to relax.

Honestly? It was exhausting. I felt like I was constantly chasing something, measuring my worth by how many things I could cram into a week. The food was decent (Panda Express in the Co-op is a lifesaver!), but late-night study sessions often meant skipping meals.

It took a while, and a few very honest conversations with my roommates, to realize that thriving wasn’t about maximizing every minute. It was about finding *my* pace. Now, I still study hard, and I’m still passionate about pre-med. But I also make time for coffee with friends, long walks around campus, and just…breathing. It's a quieter, more sustainable kind of energy, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Davis taught me that sometimes, the best moments happen outside of the plan.
