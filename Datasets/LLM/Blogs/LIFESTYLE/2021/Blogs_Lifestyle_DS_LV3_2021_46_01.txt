It’s 2021, and my Voron 2.4 has become more than a machine—it’s my late-night companion in the workshop. I’ve spent weeks dialing in Klipper, chasing that elusive perfect print. But lately, I’ve been questioning the Pressure Advance calibration advice everyone swears by.

They say to test at 100mm/s, but my prints fly at 250, even 350mm/s. It feels like tuning a race car in a school zone—sure, it works, but is it real? Life’s a bit like that, isn’t it? We follow routines because they’re safe, recommended. But what if true calibration happens at full speed, in the thick of our actual pace?

So I tried it: high-speed tests, messy at first, then revealing. The layers aligned, the corners sharpened. It hit me—sometimes, you have to test yourself not in controlled calm, but in the beautiful chaos of living. My printer and I, we’re both learning to perform best when we’re truly in motion.
