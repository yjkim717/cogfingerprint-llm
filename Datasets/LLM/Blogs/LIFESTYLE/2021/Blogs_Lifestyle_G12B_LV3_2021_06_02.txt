## That Pixel 6 Pro Photo Delay... and My Patience

Okay, so I finally upgraded to the Pixel 6 Pro this fall, excited for Google’s camera magic. But something’s been…off. I’m noticing these surprisingly long processing times after taking photos – sometimes 20-30 seconds! It's a bit jarring compared to my older Pixels. It’s made me realize how much I rely on instant gratification, even with something as simple as snapping a picture. Hoping it's just a software quirk, but it’s definitely a moment to pause and breathe!
