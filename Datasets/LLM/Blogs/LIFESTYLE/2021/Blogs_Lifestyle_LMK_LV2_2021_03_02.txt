As I laced up my Zpacks Sub-Nero for a winter hike in 2021, I couldn't help but think about the countless hours I'd spent agonizing over every detail of my ultralight backpacking setup. One question still lingered: how to attach a top-strap to my trusty pack? For those who've ventured into the world of minimalist backpacking, the importance of a well-secured load can't be overstated - especially when traversing icy trails or braving gusty mountain winds. I recalled the reassuring feel of a top-strap on my old backpack, keeping everything in place. After some trial and error, I found a solution that worked for me. For fellow backpacking enthusiasts, I'd be happy to share my experience. Sometimes, it's the smallest tweaks that make all the difference in our outdoor adventures.
