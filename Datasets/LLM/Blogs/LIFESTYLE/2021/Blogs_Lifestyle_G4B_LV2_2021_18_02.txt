**Giving a Ghost a New Life (and a Gravel Road)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something you thought you’d left behind can suddenly feel…urgent. That’s exactly how I felt staring at my old mountain bike – a relic from the late 90s, covered in mud and memories. It was a beast on the trails back then, but lately, it just felt…wrong for the way I was starting to live. 

I’m craving a slower pace, a connection with the road, and frankly, a bit of adventure beyond the weekend. So, I’m embarking on a project: a drop bar conversion. Turning this rugged mountain bike into a gravel bike, ready to tackle the bumpy roads around town and maybe even venture a little further afield. 

It’s more than just a bike build, though. It feels like giving a forgotten piece of my past a new purpose. A reminder that you don’t need a brand new machine to chase a new horizon.  It’s a little daunting, a little messy, but incredibly exciting. Wish me luck – and maybe send some good vibes my way!
