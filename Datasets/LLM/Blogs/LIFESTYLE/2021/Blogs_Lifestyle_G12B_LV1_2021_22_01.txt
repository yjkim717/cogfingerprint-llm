>## The Weight of a Good Brew (and a Little Bit of Guilt)

Okay, so this is going to sound ridiculous, potentially, but here's a confession. It involves beer, Vermont, and a surprising amount of buyer's remorse.

A few weeks ago, a friend, let’s call him Mark, pulled out a can of Heady Topper. Now, I’m a fan of craft beer – who isn’t these days? – but I’m not a *collector*. I appreciate a good IPA, a well-made stout, but the whole limited-release, chase-the-unicorn vibe has always felt a little…much.

Mark just popped it open, no fanfare, offered me one. We cracked the cans, enjoyed a ridiculously delicious double IPA, and moved on with the evening, discussing everything from the latest Marvel show to the woes of remote work. It was a perfectly pleasant night. 

Then, a week later, I stumbled across a Beer Advocate forum. Someone was lamenting the insane difficulty in acquiring Heady Topper. Apparently, it’s *the* Vermont beer, a legend, and commands ridiculous prices on the secondary market. Wait lists are months long. People drive hours, camping out, just for a chance to snag a four-pack.

Suddenly, that casual can I enjoyed felt…different. I felt a pang of guilt. Like I’d unknowingly benefitted from some elaborate, almost obsessive, pursuit of a beverage. Mark, bless his heart, just said he’d had it kicking around for ages, a gift from a trip.

It’s a silly feeling, I know. But it’s made me think a little about the culture around these exclusive products. Is the enjoyment lessened when it’s intertwined with such scarcity and hype? Or does the rarity just add to the allure? I’m still pondering. Maybe I'll stick to the local breweries for now. Less drama, just good beer.
