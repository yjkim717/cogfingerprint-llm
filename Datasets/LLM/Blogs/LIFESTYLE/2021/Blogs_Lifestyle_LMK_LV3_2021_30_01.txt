As I binge-watched the Season 2 finale of For All Mankind, a Reddit user's insightful analysis of a pivotal scene stuck with me. Their speculation about the implications for Season 3 got me thinking - what's the allure of alternate histories? Perhaps it's the thrill of reimagining our present. In 2021, as we navigated a world of uncertainty, I found solace in exploring "what ifs." This TV series invites us to reflect on our values and aspirations, much like traveling to new destinations or adopting a new morning routine - it's all about expanding our perspectives.
