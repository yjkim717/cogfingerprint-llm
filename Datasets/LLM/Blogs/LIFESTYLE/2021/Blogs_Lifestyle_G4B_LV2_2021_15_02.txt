Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 237 words, set in 2021:

**The Day I Missed Warwick Davis (and Learned a Lot About Patience)**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year, right? A year of figuring things out, of slow, deliberate steps forward. I was still recovering from a pretty hefty knee surgery – a total bummer, honestly – and my biggest goal was simply to *leave the hospital*. Seriously, that’s where my brain was focused. Get out, get home, get back to feeling even remotely normal.

I’d been reading a Tifu Reddit thread (you know how it is – a little internet escapism during recovery) and came across this guy’s story. He was in the same hospital as me, and while he was waiting to be discharged, Warwick Davis happened to be visiting. A *Warwick Davis* visit! 

I was practically vibrating with excitement, planning my ‘casual’ approach, mentally rehearsing a polite ‘hello.’ But then, the nurse called my name. I practically sprinted out, completely forgetting about the chance encounter. 

It hit me later, as I was settling back into my couch, that it was a pretty classic ‘me’ moment.  Eagerness overriding everything. It wasn’t about Warwick Davis, not really. It was about needing to *move on*, needing to escape the confines of that hospital room. 

It’s a silly anecdote, I know. But it really hammered home the importance of patience - not just in recovery, but in life. Sometimes, the best things happen when you slow down, when you let things unfold naturally.  Maybe next time, I’ll actually *wait* for the Warwick Davis moment.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way? For example, should I adjust the tone, add a specific detail, or change the length?
