"Calling all Gator gals! I'm a University of Florida student looking for like-minded roommates to share my Silver Creek Apartments 3/2 haven. As we navigate life in 2021, I'm seeking females who value a harmonious living space. If you're a fellow student looking for a chill and respectful environment, let's connect! We're looking to fill two spots, so grab your favorite coffee and let's chat about our lifestyle preferences. Let's make this apartment feel like home - together!"
