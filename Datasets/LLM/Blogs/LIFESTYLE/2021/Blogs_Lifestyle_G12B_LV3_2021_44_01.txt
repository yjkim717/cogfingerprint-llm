## The Unexpected Question at the End of the Tour

Okay, so I just wrapped up a plant tour interview for a chemical engineering internship – pretty exciting! But then came the curveball: "Do you have any feedback for us?" Honestly, I froze for a second. It’s not the usual “Do you have any questions?” Suddenly, I was supposed to critique *them*! 

It’s a good reminder that professional life throws you unexpected moments. I’m thinking a quick, constructive comment about observation points would be best. Anyone else ever felt caught off guard like that? What’s your go-to response?
