**Lost and Found: It’s Not About the High**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a blur of chasing something – a rush, a distraction. For me, it was a dangerous cocktail of cocaine and endless porn. I kept telling myself I was looking for *benefits*, some kind of fleeting happiness. But all I found was a deeper hole. 

It wasn’t until I finally admitted I was drowning that things started to shift. It wasn’t about finding a ‘better’ me, but about simply *finding* myself again. Reclaiming my life, piece by piece, was the only thing that mattered.  It’s a messy journey, but the quiet of a life rebuilt is worth more than any high.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, add a specific detail, or change the length)?
