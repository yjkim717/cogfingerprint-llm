Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and fitting the 2021 context. I've focused on the themes of reclaiming life and personal growth after breaking free from addictive patterns, without explicitly mentioning the specific examples you provided.

## Finding My Way Back to *Me*

It's been a journey, hasn't it? 2021 felt like a year of quiet reckoning for so many of us. For me, it involved confronting some habits I realized were holding me back – things I’d told myself were harmless, even necessary. Letting go wasn't easy. There were days filled with doubt, with the urge to slip back. But slowly, something shifted. Space opened up. Energy returned. I’m starting to rediscover passions I’d forgotten, and a sense of peace I haven't felt in a long time. It’s not about perfection, it’s about *life* back. And that feels pretty incredible.

**Notes on this draft:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I've used phrases like "hasn't it?" and "feels pretty incredible" to create a more personal feel.
*   **Reflective:** It focuses on the internal experience of change.
*   **Relatable:** The language is intended to resonate with a broad audience experiencing personal growth.
*   **2021 Context:** The introductory line acknowledges the broader context of the year.
*   **Keywords Incorporated (Subtly):** The core themes of addiction, recovery, and reclaiming life are present, but I avoided explicitly mentioning the examples you gave to allow for broader appeal.



I'm ready for revisions or further refinements if you'd like!
