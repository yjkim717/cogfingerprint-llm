## The Post-Op Dash and a Star I Missed

Okay, so this is a weird one to share, but it’s been rattling around in my head all week and I figured, why not? Sometimes life throws you these little curveballs, these moments of almost-connection that leave you with a lingering…what? Regret? Amusement? A little bit of both, I think.

A few weeks ago, I had a minor surgery. Nothing serious, thankfully, but enough to require a hospital stay and a fairly swift recovery plan. I was out, feeling a little groggy and definitely eager to be back in my own comfy clothes, when I practically bolted for the exit. I was focused on getting home, on a hot shower, on collapsing onto my sofa with a good book. 

Apparently, I was *very* focused.

Because as I was practically sprinting through the hospital lobby – yes, sprinting, I was fuelled by post-anaesthetic adrenaline and a desperate need for normality – I completely missed what happened next. My friend, who was accompanying me, later told me a rather unbelievable story.

Warwick Davis. *The* Warwick Davis. As in, Professor Flitwick, Leprechaun, and a whole host of other beloved characters. He was there, with his wife, quietly waiting for someone. And I, in my post-op haze, completely zoomed past him.

My friend managed a quick hello, a brief chat, apparently, but I was oblivious. I was too busy picturing myself wrapped in a blanket, finally back in my own space. The irony isn't lost on me. Here I was, a lifelong fan of fantasy and film, and I actively avoided a chance encounter with one of its most iconic figures. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we miss these moments. How often we’re so caught up in our own little worlds that we fail to notice the magic happening right around us. It’s a good reminder to slow down, to be present, to actually *look* at the world instead of just rushing through it. 

I'm not going to lie, there's a tiny part of me that's still kicking myself. A little "what if?" whispering in the back of my mind. But mostly, I'm laughing. It's a ridiculous story, and a good one to remember. And who knows, maybe our paths will cross again someday. Until then, I'll try to be a little less sprint-like and a little more observant.



What about you? Have you ever missed a great opportunity because you were too focused on something else?
