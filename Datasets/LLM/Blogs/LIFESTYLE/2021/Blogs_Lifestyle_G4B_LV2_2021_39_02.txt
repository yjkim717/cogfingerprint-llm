**Dorm Room Dreams and Davis Realities**

Okay, so 2021… it felt like a whirlwind, didn’t it? I was officially a UC Davis student, and let me tell you, the glossy brochures didn’t quite capture the *real* college life. My dorm room, initially envisioned as a Pinterest-perfect haven, quickly became a chaotic mix of textbooks, ramen wrappers, and way too many succulents. 

I spent weeks just asking other students – and even some alumni – for advice. "How do you actually *study*?" "What's the best coffee spot?" "Seriously, how do you survive midterms?"

That’s Davis, right? A beautiful, slightly overwhelming, and utterly unforgettable experience.
