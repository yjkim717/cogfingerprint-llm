>## The Subtle Art of Letting Go (of a Phone, Anyway)

Okay, so maybe it sounds silly, but I’m seriously contemplating a phone change. I’ve been loyal to my Samsung S20+ for a while now, but lately, I’ve been feeling… restless. It's not about the phone failing, it’s about the *experience*. Samsung’s UI just feels a little…cluttered these days. 

I’m drawn to the simplicity I’ve heard about with OnePlus, and honestly, the Snapdragon processor is a huge draw. It feels like a little reset button for my digital life. Sometimes, decluttering your tech feels like decluttering your mind, you know? It’s a small thing, but it’s making me think about what I truly value in my everyday tools.
