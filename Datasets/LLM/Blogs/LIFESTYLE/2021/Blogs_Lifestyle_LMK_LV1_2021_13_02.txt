As I upgraded my home lab in 2021, I stumbled upon a challenge: assigning static IPs to my VMWare Workstation guests using NAT networking. I wanted a reliable setup, so I dove into configuring the DHCP server to reserve IPs based on MAC addresses. It was a learning experience, much like how I've learned to navigate life's changes. Just as a static IP brings stability to my VMs, finding routine in chaos brings me peace.
