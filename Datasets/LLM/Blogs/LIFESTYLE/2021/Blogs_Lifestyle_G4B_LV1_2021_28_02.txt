**Tiny Metal Dreams**

It’s weird, but lately I’ve been obsessing over 3D printing – specifically, the idea of printing with metals. I was reading about using FDM printers with things like pewter and even gold alloys!  It’s mind-boggling to think you could actually *print* something solid and durable like that. 

It made me think about my own creative projects, the little bits and bobs I try to build.  I’m always striving for that perfect, polished finish, and this tech feels like a gateway to miniature metal masterpieces.  2021 was a year of experimenting, and this sparked a whole new level of fascination.  Who knows what I’ll be building next?
