It’s 2021, and my Spotify Wrapped is basically just Tricot. I don’t speak a word of Japanese, but their music hits me in a way I can’t explain. I’ll be washing dishes, a song comes on, and I’m just transported. I have no idea what the lyrics mean, but the feeling is crystal clear—a mix of frantic energy and sudden, quiet melancholy. It’s a beautiful reminder that some of the most powerful connections don’t need a common language.
