It’s 2021, and my Samsung S20+ and I have had a good run. But lately, I’ve been eyeing the OnePlus 9. It’s not just about the specs—though that Snapdragon processor is tempting. It’s the little things. Samsung’s UI sometimes feels heavy, while Oxygen OS promises a cleaner, faster experience. Am I just chasing a feeling? Maybe. But in a year where so much feels stagnant, the idea of a phone that simply feels right is a small, personal upgrade I’m ready to make.
