The Guilty Pleasure of a Rare Brew: A Lesson in Beer Culture Etiquette. 

As I sat at my friend's house in the summer of 2021, sipping on a cold Heady Topper, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I had just committed a faux pas. My friend had casually handed me the prized craft beer, and I, oblivious to its significance, cracked it open and enjoyed it without a second thought. It wasn't until later, when my friend mentioned that it was one of their rarest and most highly-rated beers, that I felt a pang of regret.

As a self-proclaimed beer enthusiast, I was well aware of Heady Topper's cult status. Still, I had no idea that my friend had been saving it for a special occasion. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that my thoughtless enjoyment of the beer was not just a minor slip-up but a reflection of my lack of understanding of the social etiquette surrounding craft beer culture.

Drinking someone else's rare beer without permission or appreciation for its significance is like eating someone's wedding cake without being invited to the wedding. It's a breach of trust and a display of thoughtlessness. My experience served as a wake-up call, reminding me to be more mindful and considerate when sharing and enjoying craft beer with others. Now, I make it a point to appreciate not just the beer but the story and significance behind it.
