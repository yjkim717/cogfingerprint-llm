It’s 2021, and my kitchen has officially declared mutiny. I swear, every time I turn around, there’s another bag of pasta or a rogue can of beans staging a coup on the counter. The pandemic turned us all into cautious stockpilers, and now I’m living with the clutter-filled aftermath.

I’ve tried to declutter, I really have. I’ll organize one shelf, feeling a fleeting sense of victory, only to find a new grocery delivery has spawned a fresh pile. It’s a constant, quiet battle between my desire for an orderly space and the reality of these uncertain times. My kitchen has become a living diary of the past year—a little chaotic, a lot resilient, and still waiting for the day the counters are clear for good.
