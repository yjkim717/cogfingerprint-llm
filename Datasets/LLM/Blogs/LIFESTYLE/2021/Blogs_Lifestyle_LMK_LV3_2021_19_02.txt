"Upgrading my PC was more than just a hardware refresh - it was a journey of discovery. As I researched compatibility between my Corsair iCUE H100i Elite Capellix Cooler and the new Intel LGA1700 socket for my 12700k processor, I realized that tech upgrades can be a metaphor for life. Just as I needed the right parts to make my PC shine, we need to upgrade our own 'parts' - skills, habits, and perspectives - to truly thrive in an ever-changing world."
