>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for that engaging, reflective, and relatable tone. I've aimed for a word count around 106 words.  I'll include a couple of options to give you a choice of slightly different feels.

**Option 1 (Focus on Uncertainty):**

## The Juggling Act: Dreams & Finances in 2021

Remember that feeling in 2021? Everything felt…unsettled. For me, it was a constant balancing act. We were seriously eyeing a bigger place – a dream home, really – around $700k. But the idea of dipping our toes into real estate investing with a smaller property, maybe around $100k, kept popping up. Would adding that investment complicate things when we applied for our primary residence mortgage? It felt like a huge question mark hanging over our future. Anyone else wrestling with similar financial leaps and hoping for the best?

**Option 2 (Focus on Hope & Planning):**

## Building Blocks: Investing for Our Future (2021 Edition)

2021 was a year of big plans in our house! We were dreaming of upgrading to a $700k primary residence – picturing cozy evenings and room to grow.  But we also started exploring real estate investing, eyeing a more affordable $100k property as a first step. It definitely sparked a lot of conversations about timing. Would it impact our mortgage approval down the line? We’re trying to map out the timeline carefully, hoping this investment will actually *help* us achieve our bigger goal. What are you all building towards?
