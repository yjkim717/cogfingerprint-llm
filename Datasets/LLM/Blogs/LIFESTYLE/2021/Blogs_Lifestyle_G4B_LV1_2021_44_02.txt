**The Fade-Out Feeling**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year for feeling like things just *ended* a little abruptly, you know? Like a really good show that just… fizzled out. I found myself thinking a lot about this lately, and it actually reminded me of something I was reading about anime. Specifically, how people felt about the *Bleach* ending.

It got me thinking about how we sometimes expect narratives – whether it’s a TV series, a personal project, or even a relationship – to have a satisfying, weighty closure. Like *Naruto* or *Fullmetal Alchemist*, where the journeys felt earned and the conclusions felt substantial. 

*Bleach’s* ending felt rushed, they said. Focused on a specific pair – Ichigo and Rukia – while letting other, more complex character arcs just… disappear. It left me with this unsettling feeling of “where did *that* go?” 

I think it’s a really relatable feeling, isn’t it?  Maybe we’re so used to expecting grand resolutions that when things simply *fade* – when a chapter closes without a truly conclusive ending – it can be jarring. It makes you wonder if you missed something, or if the story was just never meant to have a perfectly neat bow tied on.  What about you? Have you experienced that feeling lately?
