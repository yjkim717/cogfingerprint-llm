**Navigating the Medical Maze: A Parent's Plea for Answers**

It’s 2021, and I feel like I’m living in a medical detective story where all the clues lead to dead ends. Our daughter’s world has been narrowed down to two words: gastroparesis. Her current GI doctor has basically shrugged, offering Reglan with a heavy list of side effects or saying there’s nothing more he can do. We’ve heard whispers of domperidone and the existence of specialized autonomic clinics, but it’s like chasing ghosts.

Our dinner table conversations used to be about school and friends. Now, they’re dominated by symptom logs and a desperate search for someone who truly *gets it*. We’re not just looking for another prescription; we’re searching for a guide, a specialist in western Tennessee who sees the person behind the condition. Someone who can help us reclaim a sense of normalcy, one small step at a time.

If you’ve walked this path and found that guiding light, please point the way. We’re ready to follow.
