**The Weight of a Dream: Why I’m Obsessed with Ultralight Backpacking**

2021 felt…heavy. Like I was carrying a lot of unspoken expectations, a lot of ‘shoulds.’ Then I started reading about the Continental Divide Trail, specifically about ultralight backpacking. Suddenly, the idea of shedding everything – not just possessions, but also some of that mental baggage – felt incredibly appealing.

I’m not planning a thru-hike just yet, but I’m building a theoretical gear list for a solo CDT adventure. It’s a ridiculously detailed process, agonizing over ounces and grams. But honestly, it’s forcing me to confront what truly matters. 

What’s the point of carrying a heavy pack if it’s weighing down my spirit?  This whole ultralight obsession isn’t about minimizing weight; it’s about maximizing freedom.  It’s about trusting myself, relying on the elements, and finding a quiet space within myself – a space that doesn’t need a whole lot of stuff to feel full.  Any advice on those ridiculously light sleeping bags? Asking for a friend… (and a future adventure!).
