"Coping with Loss in the Pandemic: A Message of Support"

As we navigated the challenges of 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to test our resilience in ways we never thought possible. For those who lost loved ones, the pain was compounded by the isolation and uncertainty that surrounded us. I recently thought of an ex-partner who lost their father to COVID-19, and my heart goes out to them. Losing someone we love is never easy, but the pandemic made it even harder to process our emotions. If you're reading this and struggling to come to terms with your loss, I want you to know that you're not alone. Therapy sessions and grief support can be a safe space to work through your feelings. It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to take time for yourself. Reaching out is a sign of strength, not weakness. Take care of yourself during this difficult time.
