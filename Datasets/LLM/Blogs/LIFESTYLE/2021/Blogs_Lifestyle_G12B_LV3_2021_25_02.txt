## That Frustrating Feeling of Being Stuck

Anyone else ever feel like life is just… a really tough trial right now? I hit a wall in *Savage Planet’s* Sychis Trial last week – kept dying in co-op, and the game wouldn't let us restart! It was so frustrating. It made me realize how easily we can get stuck in routines or situations, feeling like there's no way out. Sometimes, you just need to find a way to reset and start fresh, right?
