Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

You know that feeling when you’re finally, *finally* closing a chapter? For me, it was moving out of my old apartment in 2021. After months of lockdowns, this move felt like a fresh start. I’d done everything right—or so I thought.

The final hurdle was getting my damage deposit back. I’d paid it with a certified check years ago, the gold standard of guaranteed payments. My building manager happily signed off, but when I took the check to my bank, I hit a wall.

“I’m sorry,” the teller said, not looking sorry at all. “Our policy doesn’t allow us to cash this. The issuing branch has to handle it.”

Cue the internal scream. The “issuing branch” was across the city, in my old life. This one piece of paper, this symbol of concluding one chapter, was now a bureaucratic nightmare preventing me from starting the next.

It’s funny, isn’t it? After a year of navigating so much uncertainty, it was a simple bank policy that brought me to my knees with frustration. Sometimes, the smallest hurdles remind you that you’re not quite in control, no matter how carefully you plan.
