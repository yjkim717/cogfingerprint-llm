**Reaching for the Stars (and a Bigger Telescope)**

2021 felt like a year of quiet yearning, didn’t it? A lot of us were looking for ways to really *see* things, to push beyond the everyday. I found myself fixated on the night sky – specifically, capturing those faint, beautiful deep-sky objects with my telescope. 

I’ve been a casual stargazer for years, but I realized my little telescope was limiting my ambitions. I wanted to truly dive into astrophotography, to bring those distant galaxies and nebulae to life. It led me down a rabbit hole of research, and honestly, a bit of a budget debate. 

The thought of upgrading to a Schmidt-Cassegrain – a bigger lens to reveal more detail – was incredibly exciting, but also a little daunting. It’s a significant investment, and I’m carefully considering alternatives within that $5k-$10k range.  It’s more than just buying a telescope; it's about expanding my perspective, just like traveling does.
