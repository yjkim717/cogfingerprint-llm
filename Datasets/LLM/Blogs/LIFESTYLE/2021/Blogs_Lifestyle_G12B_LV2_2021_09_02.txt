## The Illusion of the "Writer Life"

Okay, let's be honest. The image of a writer, hunched over a laptop in a Parisian cafe, fueled by croissants and inspiration? It’s a lovely fantasy. Here in 2021, my reality involves spreadsheets, a slightly-too-small desk, and occasionally, a frantic level of *Animal Crossing* to de-stress. I'm a professional illustrator by day, a writer by night (and stolen lunch breaks!). Sometimes I joke about spinning a tale of being a "world-famous author," just to add a little sparkle. But the truth? It’s the messy, relatable juggling act that makes this life interesting.
