**The Great CPAP Mask Experiment of 2021**

Okay, let’s be honest – CPAP isn’t always glamorous. I’ve been using one for a while now, mostly because of some persistent mouth breathing and a frankly impressive beard that likes to get *everywhere* around the mask.  I was battling constant dryness and a serious case of ‘mask-related discomfort’ with my ResMed AirSense. 

Then I started researching.  I stumbled across the AirFit N30, and figured, why not?  It’s a hybrid nasal pillow – no forehead cushion!  It’s been a surprisingly positive change.  The biggest difference is less pressure on my face, and I’m not constantly adjusting it. 

It’s funny how much a small change can impact your sleep (and your morning face!).  Anyone else out there battling CPAP quirks?
