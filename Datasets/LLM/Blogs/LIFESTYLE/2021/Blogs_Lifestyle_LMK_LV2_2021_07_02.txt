Navigating Gastroparesis in Western Tennessee: A Parent's Journey. As a parent, there's no greater worry than seeing your child struggle with a chronic condition. My daughter's gastroparesis diagnosis in 2021 left me searching for answers in western Tennessee. The constant nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain were taking a toll on her daily life. I knew I needed to find a doctor who truly understood her condition. That's when I started my quest to find a GP specialist, someone who could help manage her symptoms and improve her quality of life. I was particularly interested in finding a doctor familiar with domperidone, a medication often prescribed for gastroparesis. After months of research, I finally found an autonomic clinic with a doctor who got it. With their guidance, my daughter is now on the path to healing. If you're on a similar journey, I hope my story can offer some guidance and reassurance.
