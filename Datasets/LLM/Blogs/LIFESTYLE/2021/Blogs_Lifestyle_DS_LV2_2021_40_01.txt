It’s 2021, and I’m finally seeing clearly. For years, I chased quick fixes—especially with porn and fapping—thinking they’d fill some void. But quitting wasn’t just about stopping; it was about starting. My mind cleared, my energy surged, and real growth began. I’m no longer running from discomfort but building the life I actually want. Funny how letting go of one thing gave me everything: wisdom, purpose, and a path forward. You can reclaim your life, too.
