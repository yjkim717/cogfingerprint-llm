You know that feeling when you’re trying to do something simple, and it just… won’t… work? That was me last Tuesday. I’d decided 2021 was the year I’d finally embrace a smarter home. I bought a robot vacuum—my little automated helper, the Neato D5.

But there I was, phone in hand, staring at the app that refused to recognize my reset, re-WiFi’d, perfectly innocent-looking vacuum. It just sat there, silently judging me.

It hit me then: sometimes, the more we try to control and optimize our lives, the more life pushes back. Maybe the universe was giving me a nudge—a reminder that not everything needs to be “smart.” Some days, the most productive thing you can do is just unplug, breathe, and accept the beautiful, frustrating mess of it all.
