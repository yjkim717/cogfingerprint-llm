Looking back on my 2021 college days, I can’t help but wonder—was saving money by commuting really worth it? Sure, my bank account thanked me, but I missed out on so much: the late-night dorm talks, spontaneous pizza runs, and the kind of friendships that form when you’re just steps away from campus life. Now, I realize some experiences are priceless. If I could do it over, I’d trade a few dollars for a lot more memories.
