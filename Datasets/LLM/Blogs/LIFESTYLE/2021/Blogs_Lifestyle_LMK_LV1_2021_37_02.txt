Navigating mental health support can be tough, especially when insurance coverage is limited. I was on a quest for ADHD therapy but found it challenging to access therapists within my network. Turning to self-help books became my saving grace. I discovered insightful resources that not only helped me understand my ADHD better but also empowered me to take charge of my mental wellbeing in 2021.
