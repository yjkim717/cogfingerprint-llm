## The Balancing Act: Investing & Dreaming of Home

Okay, so 2021 has been… a year, right? For me, a big part of it has been wrestling with a financial tightrope. I dipped my toe into real estate investing, snagging a small rental property. It’s exciting, but also makes me wonder – what does this mean for the future? 

I’m picturing a cozy little house with a garden, a *primary* residence, within the next couple of years. But will that investment mortgage hold me back? It’s a question swirling in my head, a reminder that building a future requires careful planning and a little bit of nervous anticipation. Anyone else juggling similar dreams and financial realities?
