"Embracing the Remote Revolution: My Journey as a Cloud Engineer"

As I sit here in my home office, sipping coffee and staring at my screen, I'm reminded of how far I've come. Just a year ago, in 2021, I was juggling a traditional 9-to-5 job as a network specialist, dreaming of a more flexible lifestyle. Then, I discovered AWS certifications and the world of cloud engineering. I dove headfirst into studying, fueled by a desire to work from home and achieve a better work-life balance. Now, I'm on the path to becoming a certified Cloud Practitioner. It's not been easy, and I'm still seeking advice on the best study materials and what the future holds. But one thing is certain - I'm loving the freedom that comes with being a remote cloud engineer. If you're on a similar journey, I'd love to hear from you: what's working for you, and what's not?
