>## The Certified Check and the Lessons in Letting Go

Okay, so, 2021 has been… a year. A year of unexpected pivots and unexpected frustrations, right? Lately, I've been wrestling with a particularly bizarre one involving a certified check, a damage deposit, and a whole lot of bureaucratic red tape.

It started when I moved out of my apartment. Everything went smoothly, the inspection was fine, and the landlord agreed to return my security deposit. They sent it back via certified check – old school, I know, but I appreciated the formality. Then came the roadblock. My credit union, bless their hearts, refused to let me redeposit it into my account. Something about fraud prevention, a system glitch, who knows? 

Suddenly, I was stuck with a certified check I couldn't easily put back where it belonged. The landlord, understandably, couldn't just hold onto it indefinitely. So, the association handling their properties had to mail it back to me. 

It seems silly, doesn't it? A small financial hiccup. But it got me thinking about how much energy we spend fighting against systems, against rules, against things that are ultimately out of our control. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is just… let it go. Let the association mail it. Accept that the system is wonky. And breathe. 

It’s a lesson I’m trying to apply to bigger things too. Easier said than done, of course, but that little certified check incident was a surprisingly powerful reminder.
