Remember those long 2021 lockdowns? My kitchen table became a makeshift studio, cluttered with failed 3D prints in cheap plastic. I was craving something more tangible, more permanent. That's when I discovered the magic of printing with low-melting-point metals like pewter. Suddenly, my digital designs were transforming into solid, weighty objects. It felt like alchemyâ€”turning creative sparks into real, metallic art. It was a powerful reminder that even at home, we can craft something beautiful and enduring.
