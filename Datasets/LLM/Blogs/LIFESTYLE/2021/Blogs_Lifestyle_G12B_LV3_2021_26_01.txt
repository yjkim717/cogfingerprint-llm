## That Initial Push: Finding Your Momentum

Remember that feeling at the starting line? That nervous energy, the anticipation building? It struck me the other day watching a Formula 1 race – the incredible plumes of smoke as the cars launched. Turns out, it’s all about overcoming that initial static friction, that resistance holding you back. 

It got me thinking about life, really. We all face those moments where we're stuck, battling inertia. That first push, that burst of effort to break free, can feel like a lot. But just like those racing tires, once you gain momentum, things smooth out. The smoke fades, and acceleration takes over. 2021 has been a year of starts and stops for everyone, hasn't it? Maybe we just need to focus on that initial push, and trust the momentum will follow.
