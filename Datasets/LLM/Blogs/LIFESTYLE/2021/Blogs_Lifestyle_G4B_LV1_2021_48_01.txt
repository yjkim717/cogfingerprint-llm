**The Year My House Became a Cash Cow (and Maybe a FIRE Starter?)**

Okay, 2021 was… a year. Remember how everyone was predicting the housing market would crash? Well, it didn't. Not in my corner of the world, anyway. I bought my little place during the absolute frenzy of the pandemic, a bit of a leap of faith, honestly. 

Recently, I’ve been seriously contemplating a shift. The value of my house has skyrocketed – it’s almost unbelievable. It got me thinking about my FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) goals.  I’d been toying with the idea of selling, renting out the place, and using the profits to really accelerate my savings. 

The thought of a passive income stream is incredibly appealing, and honestly, a bit terrifying! I’m leaning towards exploring a refinance to get some serious cash flowing.  It’s a strange feeling – owning a property that’s suddenly become a potential engine for early retirement.  It’s definitely made me rethink my whole strategy. More to come on this one, I promise!
