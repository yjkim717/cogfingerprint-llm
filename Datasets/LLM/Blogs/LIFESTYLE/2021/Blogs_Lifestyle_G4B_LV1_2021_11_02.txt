**Trading Cables for Clouds: A Late 2021 Shift**

It feels a little strange admitting this, but last fall I was staring down a mountain of ethernet cables and seriously considering a career change. I’d spent years as a network engineer, comfortable in the predictable world of switches and routers. But a nagging feeling – a desire for something more dynamic – kept pulling at me. 

Then I stumbled across AWS and the Cloud Practitioner certification. Suddenly, ‘cloud’ wasn’t just a buzzword; it was a tangible path. I’m now leaning heavily into solution architecture, fueled by a newfound fascination with digital infrastructure. It's a huge leap, and honestly, a little daunting. But the flexibility and potential of this new direction feels incredibly exciting.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best upgrades aren’t to the hardware, but to our mindset. 2021 was definitely a year of letting go of the old to embrace the unknown!
