**Seattle Dreams & Ramen Noodles**

2021 felt like a year of serious searching. I was stuck in a cycle of low-paying jobs, mostly serving in Seattle restaurants, and honestly, the cost of living was brutal. Every paycheck felt like a tiny victory against a mountain of bills.

Seattle felt like the only place to chase that dream, even if it meant a lot of ramen noodles along the way.
