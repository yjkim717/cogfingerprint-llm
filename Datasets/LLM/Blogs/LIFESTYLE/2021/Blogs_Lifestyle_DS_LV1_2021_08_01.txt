### Desert Paws and Second Chances

Last summer, my partner and I decided to do something we hadn’t done since 2019: a proper camping trip. The destination was the high desert, a landscape of stark beauty and relentless sun. Our new rescue puppy, Barley, was coming with us, and my anxiety was through the roof. How could his little paws handle that scorching earth?

My kitchen table quickly became mission control. I ordered what felt like a miniature adventure wardrobe for a dog: rugged little shoes to shield his pads and a lightweight cooling vest. I even slathered his feet in Musher’s Secret, a trick I learned online, for extra protection.

Watching him trot confidently across the hot sand, cool and happy in his gear, was a profound lesson for me. It wasn't just about pet supplies; it was about adapting. The pandemic had made our world so small, but preparing for this trip reminded me that with a little thoughtful preparation—for both of us—we could safely embrace the big, beautiful world again. Barley’s adventure-ready paws were a perfect metaphor for my own re-entry into life.
