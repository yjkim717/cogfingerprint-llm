In my 2021 workshop, I faced a creative puzzle: how to elegantly mount a delicate 3D-printed PLA plaque onto a rustic wood backer. Should I rely on a strong adhesive for a seamless look, or choose a mechanical attachment for durability? It felt like a metaphor for life itself—finding that perfect balance between what’s beautiful and what’s built to last. In the end, a little of both gave me a piece that wasn’t just secure, but told a story of thoughtful craftsmanship.
