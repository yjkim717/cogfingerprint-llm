### The Glow Plug Lesson: Finding Power in the Pause

It was the winter of 2021, a season that felt like it would never end. My old 2000 Ford F350, a beast of a truck with the legendary 7.3L engine, had developed a maddening quirk. On the coldest mornings, just when I needed to get moving, it would lose all its get-up-and-go. The engine would start, but pressing the gas pedal did nothing. I’d be stuck in my driveway, frustrated and late, until—after a minute or two—power would suddenly return.

I spent weeks troubleshooting. I became a weekend mechanic, obsessing over sensors, wiring, and the truck’s computer. I was convinced something was fundamentally broken. The solution, when I finally found it, was a lesson that stretched far beyond my garage.

The problem was the glow plugs. On a diesel, they need a moment to warm up before the engine can run smoothly. A faulty relay was causing this "warm-up" cycle to stall the entire system. The truck wasn’t broken; it was insisting on a necessary pause. It needed that quiet moment of preparation before it could unleash its full power.

In 2021, we were all that truck. We were trying to roar back to life after a period of forced stillness, but we’d lost our throttle response. We felt stuck, frustrated that we couldn't just hit the gas and go.

My truck taught me that the pause isn’t the enemy. The glow plugs—that quiet, internal warming—are essential. Now, I try to apply that to my life. Before I launch into a hectic day or a big project, I give myself a conscious moment to "glow." A few deep breaths, a quiet coffee, a moment of planning. It feels like doing nothing, but it’s what prepares me to respond with power when it’s finally time to move. Sometimes, the way forward isn't to push harder, but to honor the warm-up.
