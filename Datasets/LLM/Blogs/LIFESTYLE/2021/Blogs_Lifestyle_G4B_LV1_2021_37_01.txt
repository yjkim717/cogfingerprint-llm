**The Quiet After the Storm (and the Debt)**

It feels a little silly writing this now, but late 2021 was… a lot. Like, a really heavy ‘a lot.’ The breakup hit hard, of course, but layered on top of that was this weird, persistent feeling of just… nothing. An emptiness that settled deep in my bones. 

I was also juggling a surprising amount of debt, which honestly just amplified the gloom. Simple things – going out for coffee, buying new clothes – felt pointless. I started pulling away from everyone, convinced I was a burden. 

I finally started therapy, which was a huge step. It wasn't a magic fix, but talking about it, acknowledging the depression and anxiety, started to chip away at the wall I'd built around myself. It’s a slow process, but learning to rebuild a life, one small step at a time, is proving to be the most important thing.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a post focusing on a specific angle (e.g., the role of therapy, or coping with debt)?
