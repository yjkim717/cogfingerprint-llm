**The Weight of a Little Extra**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a tiny addition can suddenly feel huge. Last winter, I was obsessing over shaving ounces off my Zpacks Sub-Nero – aiming for that pure, ultralight backpacking experience. I was meticulously attaching every strap, every loop, trying to make it *lighter*. 

Then, a friend suggested a simple top strap for a short winter hike. “Just for stability,” he said.  I scoffed, wanting to stick to my minimalist ideal. But honestly, the extra security felt…good.  It was a reminder that sometimes, a little bit of comfort and peace of mind outweighs the relentless pursuit of the absolute lightest load. 

Looking back at 2021, I realize it’s about finding the right balance – respecting the gear, but also trusting my own instincts and needs.  It’s not about how little you carry, but how *well* you carry it.
