It’s 2021, and I’ll admit: the cryptoverse felt like a maze at first. Blockchain, DeFi, NFTs—everyone was talking, but where do you even begin? I spent evenings sifting through endless learning resources, piecing together this sprawling ecosystem. Slowly, the technology started making sense, not as some distant future, but as a new layer of our digital lives. It’s humbling, diving into something so vast, but that first "aha" moment? That’s what keeps me curious and moving forward.
