## The Juggling Act Begins

Okay, so I’m officially a UC Davis Aggie! Freshman year is kicking off, and honestly, it's a whirlwind. Psychology major, you know? Lots of reading already. I’m trying to balance classes – making sure I hit all those pesky GE requirements while also diving into the fascinating world of the mind. It’s a lot, but the campus is gorgeous, the people are amazing, and I'm determined to make this whole "adulting" thing work. Wish me luck! 2021 felt like a fresh start, and I’m ready to grab it.
