"As we navigated 2021, I was reminded of a dear family friend struggling with uncontrolled diabetes. Not only was her health suffering, but so were her finances. In response, I started prepping low-carb, diabetic-friendly freezer meals for her. It was a game-changer! Simple meals like zucchini noodles with turkey meatballs and cauliflower rice bowls became staples. Meal prep isn't just about convenience; it's about showing we care. By sharing these meals, I hoped to help my friend manage her condition and ease her financial burden, one delicious, healthy meal at a time."
