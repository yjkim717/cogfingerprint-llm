**Finding My Water Level**

Remember that frantic energy of 2021? I was constantly "on," ping-ponging between tasks, my brain buzzing like a faulty pump. I was trying to top off my life, but the switch was always flipped, leading to burnout.

Then, while building an auto top-off for my aquarium, I had a revelation. The system needed two float switches—a "low" to start the pump and a "high" to stop it. A single trigger just caused stressful, constant cycling.

It hit me: my life needed the same upgrade. I designated my "low" trigger—a specific feeling of depletion—as my cue to rest. My "high" trigger—a sense of contentment—became my signal to stop, to avoid overfilling my schedule. Installing these mental boundaries wasn't about doing less, but about creating a healthier rhythm. Now, instead of constant frantic motion, my days have a peaceful, automatic flow, and I'm finally thriving in my own tank.
