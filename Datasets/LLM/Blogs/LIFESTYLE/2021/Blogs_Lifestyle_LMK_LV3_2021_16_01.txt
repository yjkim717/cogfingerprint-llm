The frustration of a faulty foot controller! I still recall the 2021 gig where my Boss Katana 50MK2 refused to switch to channel 2, no matter how hard I pressed the pedal. Turns out, it was stuck in latch mode - a simple setting that had me stumped for hours. A quick tweak and I was back to shredding. It was a humbling reminder that sometimes, the smallest adjustments can make all the difference in our creative pursuits.
