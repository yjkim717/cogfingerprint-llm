**Navigating the Unfamiliar: My Journey as an External Sixth Form Student**

As I stepped into the bustling corridors of my new sixth form college in 2021, a wave of uncertainty washed over me. I was an external student, not part of the traditional student body that had grown together since secondary school. The unfamiliar faces and surroundings made me feel like an outsider, and I couldn't shake off the feeling of being an outcast.

The initial days were overwhelming. I struggled to adjust to the new environment, and making friends seemed like an insurmountable task. My social anxiety began to take hold, making me question whether I had made a huge mistake by choosing this college. I felt like I was stuck on the periphery, watching my peers effortlessly interact with each other while I stood alone, trying to muster the courage to join in.

As the weeks went by, I began to realize that I wasn't alone in my struggles. Many students, including some who had been part of the college since the beginning, were facing similar challenges. It was a comforting thought, but it didn't immediately alleviate my feelings of isolation.

One day, I decided to take a step out of my comfort zone. I joined a club that aligned with my interests, and it was there that I met like-minded people who shared my passions. We bonded over our love for literature and writing, and before I knew it, I had found my tribe. It wasn't easy, and there were still moments when I felt like I didn't quite fit in. However, having a group of people who understood and accepted me made all the difference.

Looking back, I realize that my experience as an external student taught me valuable lessons about resilience and the importance of taking risks. It wasn't easy to navigate the unfamiliar terrain of a new sixth form college, but it was a journey that ultimately helped me grow as a person. I learned to be more open-minded, to step out of my comfort zone, and to be kinder to myself when faced with uncertainty.

If you're an external student starting at a new sixth form college, I want you to know that you're not alone. It may take time to adjust, but with patience and a willingness to take risks, you'll find your place. Don't be afraid to join clubs or groups that interest you â€“ it's a great way to meet like-minded people. And remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed; it's all part of the journey. As I reflect on my experience, I'm reminded that growth often lies just beyond the boundaries of our comfort zones.
