Ever since my ADHD diagnosis in 2021, I’ve been struggling to find balance. My therapist is wonderful, but sessions are few and far between. So, I turned to self-improvement books, searching for a lifeline. It’s become my personal project—curling up with a new title, hoping for that one piece of advice that makes the daily chaos feel manageable. It’s not a perfect substitute, but these books are the companions I need on the harder days.
