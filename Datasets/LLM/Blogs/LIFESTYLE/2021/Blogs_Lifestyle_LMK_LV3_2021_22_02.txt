"Discovering Japanese music in 2021 opened my eyes to a new world of sound and emotion. Despite the language barrier, I found myself drawn to the melodies and rhythms. As I explored further, I became curious about the stories behind the lyrics. It was a journey of cultural discovery, one that not only deepened my appreciation for the music but also taught me that sometimes, it's okay to not understand everything â€“ the emotions still resonate."
