**The Tiny Battle with My Garage**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year. Lots of little projects, trying to make our house *feel* like home, you know? I decided to finally update the house number on the garage – a simple little plaque, really. But attaching it to the siding? Total nightmare. It kept popping off! 

I spent a ridiculous amount of time researching – siding clips, different adhesives, even considering tiny nails (don’t judge!). It turned into this surprisingly frustrating mini-project. It really highlighted how sometimes the smallest things can become a surprisingly big deal when you’re trying to make a place your own. 

Turns out, a specific type of clip finally did the trick. Small victory, but a good reminder that a little persistence can go a long way.  What’s one little home improvement project you’ve wrestled with lately?
