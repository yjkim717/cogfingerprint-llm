There’s a certain kind of exhaustion that settles in after a night that was supposed to be fun. It’s 2021, and we’re all still grasping for some semblance of normalcy, some escape from the weight of the world. For my friends and me, that often looked like a bottle.

I used to think alcohol was the social glue, the thing that loosened everyone up and made conversations flow. But lately, I’ve been seeing the cracks. I’ve watched people I love transform under its influence. The quiet friend becomes belligerent. The funny one turns cruel, their jokes landing like punches. I’ve seen car keys jingled by someone who was in no state to drive, a moment of terrifying irresponsibility that sucked all the air out of the room.

It’s in these moments that the whole ritual feels profoundly pointless. We’re drinking to escape, but all we’re doing is creating a new set of problems—hurt feelings, fractured trust, and a lingering anxiety that hums beneath the hangover. The laughter feels forced, and the connection feels flimsy, a temporary illusion bought at a high price.

I’m not here to preach sobriety for everyone. I’m just… tired. Tired of the drama, the apologies the next day, the slow erosion of genuine friendship. Maybe the real escape isn't in a glass, but in being present enough to actually enjoy the company we keep, without needing a substance to mediate it. Maybe the best nights are the ones we can actually remember, for all the right reasons.
