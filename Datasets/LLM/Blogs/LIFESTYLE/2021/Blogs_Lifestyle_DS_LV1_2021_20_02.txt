That first audition for the Governor’s School in 2021 was a blur. I remember the adjudication slot, the required mask muffling my lines, and my acting coach’s advice echoing in my head. It felt less like a performance and more like a test of pure will. But pushing through that strange, distanced process taught me more about resilience than any role ever could. Sometimes, the biggest growth happens just by showing up, even when the stage feels unfamiliar.
