**Lost in the Scroll, Found in the Schedule**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a constant battle against the endless scroll. I was *productive* in theory – juggling work, a fledgling sourdough hobby, and trying to stay connected – but perpetually feeling behind. Then, I remembered a little nugget from an old productivity blog: planning. 

It started small – just blocking out time in my calendar for focused work. Adding a timer for those sourdough sessions (seriously, it helped!).  I’m not saying I’m suddenly Marie Kondo-ing my life, but consciously scheduling things actually shifted my mindset. 

There’s something incredibly grounding about seeing my day laid out, and those little accountability timers? They’ve been surprisingly effective. It’s a slow process, but I’m learning that managing my time isn’t about doing *more*, it’s about being more intentional.
