>## The Slow Expansion of My Digital Life (and My NAS!)

It's funny how life mirrors tech, isn't it? I started this year with a simple NAS – a QNAP TS-453Be – just enough for basic backups and a little Plex streaming. Now, a few months in, I'm staring down a TR-004 expansion unit, ready to add more drives. It feels symbolic. 

Like my hobbies, my interests, even my knowledge, everything's slowly expanding. I’ve been diving deeper into photography, collecting more movies, and… well, just generally accumulating *stuff*.  It’s a bit daunting, this constant growth, but also exciting. RAID 5 configuration is proving a fun challenge, prepping for that extra storage. Feels good to have a system, both digital and personal, ready to handle whatever comes next.
