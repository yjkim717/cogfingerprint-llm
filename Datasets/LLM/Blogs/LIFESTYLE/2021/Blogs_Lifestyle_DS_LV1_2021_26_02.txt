In the fall of 2021, I was juggling online classes and a budding interest in web development, feeling pulled between the reliability of Windows and the developer-friendly world of Ubuntu. I decided to take the plunge with a refurbished ThinkPad, setting up a dual-boot system. That single machine became my portalâ€”coding on one side, gaming and essays on the other. It taught me that sometimes, the best way to find balance isn't by choosing one path, but by gracefully walking two at once.
