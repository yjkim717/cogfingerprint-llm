## The Little Robot That Wouldn't Connect (and What It Taught Me)

Okay, so I’m not usually one to get frustrated with technology. But last weekend, my patience was seriously tested. I’d found a used Neato D5 vacuum for a steal – a robot helper! Visions of clean floors with minimal effort danced in my head. 

Except, it refused to connect to the Neato app. I followed every troubleshooting step online, checked the WiFi, restarted everything… nothing. Hours spent wrestling with a little robot, all while feeling increasingly silly. 

Finally, after a factory reset (thank you, internet forums!), it synced. The relief! It felt ridiculously triumphant. More than just a vacuum working, it was a reminder that sometimes, even small victories require a little perseverance. And in the chaos of 2021, those little moments of triumph are worth celebrating. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a floor to be vacuumed.
