**The Weight of a Glass (and a Few Bad Choices)**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 felt like a year of learning *a lot* about people, and honestly, about myself. I found myself increasingly frustrated with a certain pattern I was seeing around some of my friends – the constant haze of drinking, the way it seemed to unravel good relationships. 

It wasn’t just the obvious stuff, like the late-night chaos and the occasional near-miss. It was the subtle shifts, the way boundaries got blurred, the feeling that people were prioritizing a buzz over genuine connection. I started noticing it in my own friendships, too, feeling a weird knot of anxiety when someone was consistently relying on alcohol to cope or to loosen up.

There’s a dark side to “fun,” isn’t there? A way that something meant to bring us together can actually build walls. I realized I was grappling with this whole concept of toxic friendships – not in a dramatic, explosive way, but in a quiet, persistent drain on my energy. 

It made me think a lot about personal boundaries. How do you gently remind someone that their behavior is impacting you? How do you protect your own peace when you see a friend struggling?  It’s a messy, uncomfortable process, and I’m still figuring it out. But recognizing the weight of a glass – and the potential damage it can cause – was a really important step.
