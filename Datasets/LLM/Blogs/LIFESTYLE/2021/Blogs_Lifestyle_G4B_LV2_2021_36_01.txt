**The Quiet Hum of a New System**

It’s funny how a simple upgrade can feel so… significant. Last year, I finally bit the bullet and switched my desktop to a Linux Mint system with an NVMe SSD. Suddenly, loading files – my photos, documents, everything – felt *instantaneous*. 

Before, I was wrestling with a slower SATA drive, and honestly, it was a constant low-level frustration. Now, it’s just a quiet hum, a subtle reminder of a smoother, more reliable experience. I'm experimenting with Btrfs for added safety, too. It’s a small change, but it’s shifted my whole workflow – a little bit of tech magic, really.
