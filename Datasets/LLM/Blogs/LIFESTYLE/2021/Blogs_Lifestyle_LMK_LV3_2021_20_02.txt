"As I prepared for the Virginia Governor's School theater audition in 2021, I realized that success wasn't just about perfecting my craft, but also about mental preparation. I learned to manage my nerves, trust my training, and let my passion shine through. For fellow high school juniors, I share my journey: staying focused, being authentic, and embracing the experience can make all the difference in auditioning for a prestigious program like the governor's school."
