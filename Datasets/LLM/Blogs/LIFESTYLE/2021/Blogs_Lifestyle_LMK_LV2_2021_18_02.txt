"Rekindling My Love Affair with Cycling: A Gravel Bike Conversion Story

As I pedaled through the potholed roads to work in 2021, I couldn't help but think about my trusty old mountain bike collecting dust in the garage. It was a relic of the 90's, with its rigid frame and chunky tires. My daily 12-mile commute was taking a toll on my hybrid bike, and I was itching for a change. I started pondering a gravel bike conversion - slapping on some drop bars, new shifters, and giving my old MTB a new lease on life. It wasn't just about the bike, though. It was about recapturing the joy of cycling that had drawn me in as a kid. As I envisioned the project, I felt a spark reignite. I was ready to trade in my mundane commute for an adventure, one that would take me off the beaten path and back to the thrill of the ride."
