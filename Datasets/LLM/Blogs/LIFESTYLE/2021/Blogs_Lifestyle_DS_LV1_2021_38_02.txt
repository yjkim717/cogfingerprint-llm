### The Hardest Conversation: When Love Means Stepping Back

It was the summer of 2021, and the world felt like it was tentatively reopening, but for my ex, Mark, it was collapsing. His father, a vibrant man taken by COVID-19, was gone. Our calls, once filled with easy banter, were now heavy with a silence I didn’t know how to fill.

He’d say things like, “I’m fine, just need to power through,” dismissing any mention of his grief. But I saw the exhaustion in his eyes during our video chats. The “old normal” everyone was chasing didn’t exist for him anymore, and “powering through” felt like watching someone try to run on a broken leg.

So, I took a deep breath. “Mark,” I started, my voice softer than I intended, “I can’t imagine this pain. But I care about you, and I’m worried. What would you think about talking to a therapist? Not because you’re broken, but because you’re carrying something incredibly heavy.”

It wasn’t about fixing him or us. It was about handing him a map when he was lost in a storm. Sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is gently point toward the lifeboat, even if you can’t be the one to row it.
