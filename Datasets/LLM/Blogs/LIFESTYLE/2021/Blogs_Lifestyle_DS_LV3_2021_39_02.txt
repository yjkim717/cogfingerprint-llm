It’s wild to think that just last year, I was nervously scrolling through UC Davis forums as a high school senior, wondering if I’d survive as a psych major on a pre-med track. Fast forward to fall 2021: I’m unpacking in my dorm, meeting my roommate for the first time. She’s an environmental science major, and our late-night talks over instant ramen have become my favorite part of the week. Balancing bio lectures with psych discussions is challenging, but it’s also revealing how interconnected everything feels. The campus social scene is slowly buzzing back to life, and I’m learning that college isn’t just about the classes—it’s about these small, shared moments that make you grow.
