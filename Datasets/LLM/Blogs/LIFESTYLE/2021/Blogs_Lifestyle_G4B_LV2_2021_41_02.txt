**The Frustrating Loop of Tech & Trying**

Anyone else feel like 2021 was *the* year of digital frustration? I swear, I spent a solid afternoon wrestling with Rainbow Six Vegas – just trying to get online for a quick multiplayer session. The servers were supposedly up, but my connection kept dropping, and the error messages just piled up. 

It’s a weird thing, isn’t it? You’re craving connection, a little bit of shared experience, and then you’re slammed against the wall of a glitchy system. It made me think about how much of our lives now hinges on these digital platforms, and how easily we can get caught in a loop of troubleshooting and disappointment. 

Sometimes, you just need to step away, breathe, and remember that not everything is about a perfect connection.  Anyone else have a similar tech-induced meltdown lately?
