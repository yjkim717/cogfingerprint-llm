**Two Homes, One Future?**

It’s 2021, and everyone seems to be chasing the ‘dream’ – a place to call home, and maybe a little side hustle to boost the bank account. I was wrestling with a similar question lately: should I seriously explore an investment property loan? The thought of building equity while renting felt good, but what about my long-term goal of a *primary* residence? 

Honestly, the timeline felt so murky. Would adding another mortgage complicate things? It’s a valid worry, and one I'm still sorting out.  It’s a balancing act, isn’t it?
