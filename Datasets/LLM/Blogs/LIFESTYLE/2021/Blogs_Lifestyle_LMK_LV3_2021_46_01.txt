The Fine Line Between Speed and Precision: A 3D Printing Dilemma. As I stood in front of my humming Voron 2.4 3D printer in 2021, I found myself pondering a crucial question: should I follow Klipper's recommended 100mm/s for Pressure Advance Tuning or stick to my usual high printing speeds? It's a decision that goes beyond just 3D printing - it's about finding a balance between speed and precision in our fast-paced lives. Just like my printer, we often operate at high velocities, sacrificing accuracy for the sake of getting things done quickly. But what if slowing down could improve our output? By tuning into the nuances of our craft, whether it's 3D printing or another pursuit, we can achieve a more refined result. As I weighed my options, I realized that sometimes, it's necessary to dial back our pace to truly move forward.
