There’s a Japanese band I’ve been obsessed with since 2021, and I don’t understand a word they’re singing. Yet, their music hits me right in the soul. I find myself wondering, what stories are hidden in those poetic lyrics? Is it heartbreak? A call to adventure? My curiosity has become part of the joy—creating my own meanings, feeling the emotion in every chord. It’s a beautiful reminder that sometimes, the most profound connections don’t need a common language, just an open heart.
