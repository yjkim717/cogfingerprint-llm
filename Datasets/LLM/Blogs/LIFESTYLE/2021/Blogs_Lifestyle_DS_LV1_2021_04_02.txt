### A Lesson in Letting Go, Courtesy of My Prayer Plant

It’s funny how the smallest things can teach you the biggest lessons. This past Thanksgiving, amidst the chaos of hosting and pie-baking, I completely forgot about my prayer plant. I came back to it a few days later to find its beautifully patterned leaves hanging limp and defeated. My heart sank.

I did what any panicked plant parent would do: I gave it a thorough drink and hoped for a quick recovery. But days turned into a week, and it remained stubbornly sad. No amount of water could reverse the stress it had endured.

Feeling helpless, I made a tough call. I took my shears and snipped a few of the healthiest-looking stems for propagation. It felt drastic, like admitting defeat. But as I placed those cuttings in water, watching for the first signs of new roots, I realized this wasn't a failure. It was a reset.

Sometimes, in life and with our houseplants, we can't just pour water on a problem and expect it to bounce back. The damage is done. The real growth begins when we have the courage to let go of what’s not working and nurture the parts that still have life in them. Here’s to new beginnings, in 2021 and beyond.
