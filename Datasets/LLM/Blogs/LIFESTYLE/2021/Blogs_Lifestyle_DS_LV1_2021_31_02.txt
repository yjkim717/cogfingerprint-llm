Last winter, my friend’s diabetes spiraled out of control. Between doctor visits and tight finances, cooking felt impossible. So, we started a Sunday ritual: prepping low-carb freezer meals together. We’d laugh, chop vegetables, and fill containers with hearty, diabetic-friendly stews and bakes. It wasn’t just meal prep; it was a lifeline. By turning a health challenge into a shared, manageable task, we found a little peace in a tough year. It reminded me that the simplest acts of care can be the most powerful medicine.
