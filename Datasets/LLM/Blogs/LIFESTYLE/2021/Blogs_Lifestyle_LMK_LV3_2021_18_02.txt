"Rebels on Wheels: Giving New Life to an Old MTB"

As I dusted off my trusty 90's MTB from the garage, a wave of nostalgia washed over me. I had ridden it relentlessly back in the day, but now it was time to give it a new purpose. With my daily 12-mile commute on rough roads becoming increasingly grueling, I decided to convert it into a gravel bike. The idea of swapping the flat bars for drop bars and upgrading the shifters got me excited. I was drawn to the simplicity of STI shifters, but the cost was a deterrent. As I weighed my options, I realized this project wasn't just about upgrading a bike â€“ it was about embracing a more sustainable, adventurous lifestyle. By giving new life to an old bike, I was not only reducing waste but also challenging myself to be more resourceful. As I hit the rough roads on my revamped MTB, I felt a sense of freedom and a deeper connection to the cycling community.
