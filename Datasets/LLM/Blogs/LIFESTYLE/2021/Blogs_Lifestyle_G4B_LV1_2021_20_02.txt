**The Weight of a Single Step**

It feels like 2021 was *the* year of big decisions, right? I was obsessing over my high school theater audition – seriously, the Governor’s School was a huge deal. I spent weeks with my acting coach, dissecting monologues, battling nerves. It wasn’t just about the performance; it was about this intense, focused feeling of wanting to prove myself. Ultimately, it didn't go as planned, but the process taught me that sometimes, the courage is in *trying*, not succeeding.
