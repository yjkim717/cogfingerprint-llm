Of all the ways to learn a lesson in social etiquette, I never thought mine would come from a can of beer. It was the summer of 2021, and I was at my friend Mark’s backyard gathering. The sun was setting, laughter filled the air, and he handed me a tall, unassuming tallboy from his fridge. “You’ll like this one,” he said with a casual smile.

I cracked it open. The beer was incredible—a burst of citrus and pine, perfectly balanced and refreshing. I drank it with the uncomplicated joy I reserve for a cold lager on a hot day, not thinking twice. We chatted, the evening wound down, and I headed home, pleasantly buzzed and content.

The regret didn’t hit until the next morning. Boredly scrolling through a craft beer forum, I saw a photo of the exact can. The comments were a chorus of longing and frustration. “Heady Topper,” they called it. A legendary double IPA from Vermont, famously difficult to find outside its home state, spoken of with a reverence usually reserved for mythical creatures. People told stories of driving hours on a rumor of a shipment, only to find empty shelves.

My stomach sank. That incredible beer I’d so casually enjoyed wasn’t just a good IPA; it was a trophy. I had unknowingly consumed a piece of liquid gold that Mark had likely gone to great lengths to acquire. Did I overstep? Should I have asked what it was? The simple pleasure of the moment was instantly retrofitted with a layer of guilt. It was a stark reminder that in the nuanced world of adult friendships, sometimes the rarest thing isn’t the beer itself, but the quiet, generous act of sharing it without a hint of expectation. I still haven’t quite forgiven myself for my blissful ignorance.
