"Kitten Chaos: A Post-Spaying Saga"

I'll never forget the day we brought our little ball of fluff home from the vet after her spaying surgery in the spring of 2021. We were relieved that the procedure was over, and our kitten was on the road to recovery. However, our relief was short-lived. A few days post-op, we noticed a suspicious lump near the incision site. We were worried sick - had the antibiotics not done their job? Was it a sign of a more serious complication? As the lump grew, so did our concern. We immediately contacted our vet, who reassured us that post-op swelling was normal, but we couldn't help but fret. With some extra TLC and a follow-up check-up, our kitten was back to her playful self in no time. The experience taught us to stay vigilant and trust our instincts as pet parents.
