## The Waiting Game & My New Phone

Okay, so I finally upgraded my phone! A Pixel 6 Pro, to be exact. Super excited about the camera – I love capturing little moments. But… there’s a bit of a catch. It seems to take *forever* to process photos, especially when it’s dark. Like, genuinely longer than any phone I've owned. 

It’s a weird feeling, isn’t it? Investing in something you anticipate will simplify things, and then encountering a little hiccup. Hoping it's just a software thing and not a bigger issue. Anyone else experiencing this? Let me know! It's comforting to know I'm not alone in the tech-frustration club.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
