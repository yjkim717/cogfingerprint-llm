The soft hum of my 3D printer used to be the sound of pure potential. In early 2021, my little corner of the world was a haven of creation, a place where digital dreams became tangible, layer by meticulous layer. That is, until I decided to upgrade.

Enter the ERCF, the Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder. It promised a rainbow of colors at my fingertips, a multi-filament marvel. I installed it with the giddy excitement of a kid on Christmas morning. But my first `print_start` command after the installation was met not with a triumphant whir, but with the sad, empty scratch of a nozzle trying to purge a line that wasn't there. The filament was still loading, lagging several crucial seconds behind the G-code’s impatient instructions.

There I was, staring at this brilliant piece of engineering, feeling a strange kinship with it. Wasn't this a little too relatable? How often do we try to "purge" and start a new project before we're fully "loaded"? We jump into a new fitness regime before our gear arrives, or commit to a side hustle before we’ve acquired the necessary skills. We try to draw the first line before the filament of our own preparedness has even reached the hotend.

My printer and I were both guilty of skipping a critical step in the sequence. The solution wasn't to force the purge line; it was to rewrite the code, to build in a patient pause, a moment of allowance for the loading to complete. It’s a lesson I’m taking beyond the print bed. Now, before I embark on anything new, I ask myself: "Is the filament loaded?" It’s a small check for readiness that makes all the difference between a failed start and a perfect first layer.
