## The Author Card (and My Crayons)

It's 2021, and the world’s still navigating… well, a lot. But lately, I've been pondering a peculiar thing: author identity. I spend my days crunching numbers in a perfectly respectable (and wonderfully boring) day job. Evenings? Netflix and attempting to keep my houseplants alive. Yet, sometimes, I feel this urge to casually drop the "author" title at a party. Like it’s just another hobby.

The absurdity hit me when I was sketching with my niece – crayons, mind you, not fancy digital tablets – and thought, "Do these crayons qualify me as a professional illustrator?" Probably not. But maybe, just maybe, the act of *creating* does. And that, I suppose, is enough to warrant a little authorly pride.
