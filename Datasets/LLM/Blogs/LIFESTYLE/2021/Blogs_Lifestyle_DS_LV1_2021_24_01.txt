### The Day My Code Taught Me About My Own Backyard

It all started with a simple, stubborn problem. I was hunched over my keyboard, the blue glow of PowerShell staring back at me. My mission: to scrape the addresses of every Nationwide branch in the region for a project. The logic seemed sound—`Invoke-WebRequest` to fetch the page, then pluck out all the `href` links from the directory listing. But my script kept spitting out broken, half-formed URLs. I was trying to force pieces together that just wouldn't fit, getting more frustrated by the minute.

I finally stepped away, making a cup of tea just to do something with my hands. That’s when it hit me. The problem wasn't in the code; it was in my approach. I was so focused on the mechanical act of concatenation that I’d forgotten the foundational principle of a web address—it needs a proper, complete path to be of any use. The fix, when I returned, was a simple one-liner, a moment of clarity after an hour of grunt work.

It was 2021, and in a year spent so much indoors, this tiny victory felt monumental. But the bigger lesson was about connection. I’d been so intent on digitally mapping these branches that I realized I’d never actually visited the one just a ten-minute walk from my house. The next day, I closed the laptop and walked there. The solution wasn't just in the script; it was in remembering that life, and a valid URL, requires you to properly connect the pieces, both on the screen and right outside your door.
