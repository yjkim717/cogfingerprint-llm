Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the provided summary and aiming for a relatable, reflective, and conversational tone, set in 2021. I've tried to weave in the CPAP element subtly to feel natural within a lifestyle context.  I've included a suggested title and a couple of potential image ideas at the end.

## The Quiet Revolution of Small Comforts

It’s funny, isn't it, how the biggest shifts in life often come from the smallest adjustments? 2021 has felt… weighty. A year of recalibrating, of realizing what truly matters when the world feels a little unsteady. For me, a lot of that has been about prioritizing *quiet* comfort.

I used to chase grand gestures, big vacations, the feeling of constant “doing.” But lately, I’ve found more joy in the everyday. Like finally figuring out a sleep setup that actually *works*. Seriously, who knew choosing a mask could feel like a personal victory? (Don’t worry, I’ll spare you the technical details!).

It's been a lesson in self-care, really. Recognizing that needing a good night's rest, needing to feel comfortable and secure, isn't a luxury – it’s a foundation. It’s the bedrock on which everything else is built.

And that's spilled over into other areas. Less pressure to be "on," more time for slow mornings with a book, a conscious effort to declutter not just my space, but my mental load too. It’s a quiet revolution, this pursuit of small comforts. And honestly? It feels pretty revolutionary.
