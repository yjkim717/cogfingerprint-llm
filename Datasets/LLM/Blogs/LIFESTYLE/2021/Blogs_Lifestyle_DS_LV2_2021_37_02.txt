The search for an affordable ADHD therapist in 2021 felt like a cruel joke. Insurance loopholes and endless waitlists left me stranded. So, I turned to the one thing I could afford: books. My local bookstore became my therapist's office. It’s a lonely path, self-prescribing therapy from pages, but there’s a quiet empowerment in it, too. Sometimes, the best support is the resource you can hold in your own two hands.
