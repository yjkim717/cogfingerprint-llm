The Nightcap Conundrum: Unpacking the Frustration of Friends and Booze. 

As I sat at the dinner table, watching my friends devour their meals and knock back drink after drink, I couldn't help but wonder - why do we do this to ourselves? The night wore on, and the conversation turned from lively to loud, the laughter from genuine to forced. It was as if the more they drank, the less I recognized them. The charming friend became obnoxious, the witty one turned sloppy, and the quiet one... well, they just got quieter. 

I've lost count of how many times I've found myself thinking, "This is why I don't drink." Not because I don't enjoy a good glass of wine or a fun night out, but because I struggle to understand why my friends seem to lose all sense of responsibility and decorum when intoxicated. It's like they're handing over the reins to a less considerate version of themselves. 

I've tried to brush it off, attributing it to the social norms of letting loose and having a good time. But the truth is, it's hard not to take it personally when you're left to deal with the aftermath - the slurred apologies, the missed rides, the embarrassing stories that'll be retold for years to come. I'm not asking for much; just a modicum of self-awareness would be nice. As I navigated the rest of the night, sipping on my one drink, I realized that maybe it's not about the booze - it's about the friendships and the memories we're creating. Or, at the very least, not letting the booze get in the way of what's truly important.
