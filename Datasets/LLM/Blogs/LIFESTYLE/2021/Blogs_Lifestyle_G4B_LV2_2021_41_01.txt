**Lost in the Scroll? Let’s Find Ourselves Again.**

It’s 2021, and let’s be honest – my phone is practically an extension of my hand. I’ve caught myself dozens of times, meticulously staging a photo of my coffee, instead of *actually* enjoying it. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about this whole “experience vs. capture” thing. 

There’s a quiet sadness in realizing I’m documenting life instead of living it.  I’m trying to be more intentional about putting the phone down – to truly *see* the way the sunlight hits my daughter’s face, to hear the laughter of friends without thinking about the perfect Instagram story.  It’s a work in progress, but it feels…essential.
