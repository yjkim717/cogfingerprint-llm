>## The Quiet Obsession & A Bowl of Comfort

Okay, so I’ve been deep down a rabbit hole lately. A very specific, very Japanese rabbit hole. It started with a fleeting recommendation for a band called tricot. Now? My Spotify is 80% their music, and I’m trying to decipher lyrics about… well, I'm honestly not entirely sure *what* they're about. 

It's a little silly, really. I'm this American, meticulously translating phrases, half-expecting to uncover some profound, culturally-sensitive controversy. Like, what if one of their songs is secretly about… something I shouldn’t know? 

The whole experience has been oddly comforting though. It’s a dedicated distraction, a quiet obsession in a year that feels anything but quiet. And lately, all I really want is something comforting. A warm potage simmering on the stove, the repetitive energy of Japanese post-punk... It’s a strange combination, but it's working for me right now.
