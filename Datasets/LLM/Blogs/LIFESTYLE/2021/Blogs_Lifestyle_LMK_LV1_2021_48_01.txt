The Real Estate Boom Has Me Reconsidering My Financial Future. As I sat down to review my finances in early 2021, I couldn't help but notice the significant impact the real estate boom was having on my net worth. The housing market had been on fire, and my home's value had skyrocketed. I had purchased my house a few years ago, and while it was always a solid investment, I hadn't anticipated the rapid appreciation in value. As someone who's been following the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, this unexpected windfall has got me thinking - should I sell and cash in on the gains? As a non-cash buyer, I've been diligently paying down my mortgage, but with refinancing options and rising housing prices, the math is starting to make sense. If I sell now, I could potentially accelerate my journey to financial independence. But is it worth leaving behind the comfort and security of my current home? I'm weighing my options, and it's clear that this real estate boom has thrown a curveball into my long-term plans. The question now is - what's next?
