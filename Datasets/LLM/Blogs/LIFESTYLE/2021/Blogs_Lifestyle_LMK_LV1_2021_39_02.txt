"Life as a Psych Major at UC Davis: The Ups and Downs"

As I sit in my dorm room, surrounded by textbooks and notes, I reflect on my first year at UC Davis. As a psych major on the premed track, I was nervous about balancing academics and social life. But, living with a great roommate and being part of a close-knit community made all the difference. We'd study together, grab dinner at the dining hall, and explore campus events. The food at UC Davis is surprisingly good - who knew vegan options could be so delicious? Campus life has been a blast, from attending concerts to joining psych clubs. Of course, there are challenging days, but my roommate and I always have each other's backs. As I look back on 2021, I'm grateful for the ups and downs that have shaped my UC Davis experience.
