I'm still baffled by the drinking culture that's so prevalent in our social lives. As I sit here, sipping on a sparkling water, I'm surrounded by friends laughing and clinking glasses filled with beer and cocktails. But I'm not joining in - at least, not tonight.

To be honest, I've never really "gotten" the point of drinking. Sure, a glass of wine or a cold beer can be enjoyable on occasion, but the excessive drinking that seems to be the norm these days just doesn't resonate with me. Maybe it's because I've seen too many friends and acquaintances cross the line from social drinking to outright drunkenness, behaving in ways that are just plain embarrassing.

Last weekend was a perfect example. We were out at a bar, celebrating a friend's birthday, and the drinks were flowing. Before long, people were stumbling around, slurring their words, and making fools of themselves. I watched as a friend vomited in the bathroom, and another got into a heated argument with a stranger. It was like watching a train wreck - you don't want to look, but you can't help but stare.

As I stood there, nursing my water, I couldn't help but wonder: is this really the lifestyle we want to be living? Is getting drunk and behaving badly really the best way to have a good time? For me, the answer is a resounding "no." I'd rather be around people who are present, engaged, and enjoying themselves without the need for a crutch. As we head into a new year, I'm making a conscious choice to prioritize my own lifestyle choices - and that means being mindful of the company I keep, and the habits we cultivate together.
