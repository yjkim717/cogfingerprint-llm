Looking back at the fall of 2021, I remember scrolling through endless UC Davis forums, my screen glowing in the dark. I was a high school senior, buzzing with a mix of excitement and pure terror. My biggest question wasn't just about which Psych 101 professor to take, but whether I could actually handle the premed track. Could I balance those demanding science classes and still have a life?

And the roommate search felt like a high-stakes dating game. Would I find someone who also needed absolute silence to study, but also wanted to explore Davis's farmer's market on weekends?

It’s funny how those specific, frantic questions—about classes, housing, and finding your people—are such a universal part of the leap into college. That anxious search for answers was the real beginning of finding my own way.
