## The Frustration of Near Misses (and Finding Patience)

Anyone else ever feel like they're *right there*, but just… not quite? Lately, I've been pouring hours into MLB The Show's franchise mode, and I'm hitting that wall. I'm making solid contact, even perfect contact, but the ball just keeps finding gloves. It's maddening! 

Even on Veteran difficulty, it feels like I need to adjust my sliders – lean more into contact hitting, maybe? It’s a frustrating reminder of life, isn’t it? Putting in the work, seeing progress, but still missing that final connection. It's teaching me a little about patience, about trusting the process, and realizing that sometimes, even perfect execution doesn’t guarantee the outcome. Anyone else feeling this in their own games (or lives!) these days?
