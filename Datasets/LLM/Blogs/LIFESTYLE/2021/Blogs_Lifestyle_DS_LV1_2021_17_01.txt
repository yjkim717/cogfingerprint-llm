It’s 2021, and after a year of endless scrolling, I realized my phone should feel like a calm companion, not a source of friction. My Samsung S20+ with its Exynos chip and heavy UI started to weigh on me. I craved something smoother, more intuitive. That’s when I considered the OnePlus 9—its clean Oxygen OS and reliable Snapdragon processor called to me. Sometimes, a small tech change isn't just an upgrade; it’s a lifestyle reset toward simplicity.
