It’s funny, isn’t it, how the things that connect us most deeply can happen when we’re furthest apart? That thought struck me again last night, curled up on my couch for a virtual classical concert in 2021. The world still felt so fragmented, yet here was this beautiful, collective act of listening.

The concert was for a scholarship fund, honoring a young violinist named Andriko Bilaniuk from Bishop O’Connell High School. As the music swelled through my speakers, I wasn't just hearing notes; I was hearing a legacy. A reminder that even in isolation, we can build bridges. We can choose to invest in a future where beauty and education aren't canceled, but championed.

It made my own living room feel sacred. My tax-deductible gift felt less like a transaction and more like a quiet promise—a small stitch in the fabric of a community determined to heal, one student, one song, at a time.
