The decision to commute to college in 2021 seemed practical—I’d save money and stay close to home. But as weeks turned into months, I watched from the sidelines. While dorming students bonded over late-night talks and spontaneous campus adventures, I was just passing through. Making friends felt like trying to catch a train that had already left the station. Now, I realize I traded convenience for connection, and that empty seat on the campus shuttle is a daily reminder of what I’m missing.
