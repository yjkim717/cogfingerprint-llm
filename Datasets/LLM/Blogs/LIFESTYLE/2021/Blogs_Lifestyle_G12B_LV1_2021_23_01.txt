## Finding the Soundtrack to Momentum

It's weird how a song can perfectly encapsulate a feeling, right? Lately, I've been chasing that feeling of effortless motion – like watching a skater nail a trick, all smooth and confident. I’ve been craving music that matches that vibe: driving guitars, lyrics that zip by, a sense of forward momentum. I love The Floozies, but I'm looking for something a little less synth-heavy. 2021 feels like a year of rebuilding, of picking up speed again, and finding that soundtrack feels crucial. Anyone else on a similar musical quest? Drop your recommendations!
