## The Commute and the Missed Connections

It’s 2021, and I’m staring out the window of the 7:15 AM train, heading into campus. Another day, another hour-long commute. Don't get me wrong, saving money by living at home was a *huge* win when I started college. My parents were thrilled, my bank account was happy, and I felt like a responsible adult.

But lately, a little voice has been whispering, "What if?" What if I’d chosen to dorm? 

I see groups of students laughing together as they walk across campus, and I can’t help but wonder what that experience would have been like. Those late-night study sessions, the impromptu pizza runs, the easy friendships forged in the shared chaos of dorm life... I missed out on all of that. 

It's not a regret I dwell on, but it's a quiet awareness. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most valuable experiences aren't always the most practical ones. Maybe next time, I'll prioritize connection over cost.
