It was supposed to be the perfect 2021 road trip: a long-awaited journey to the mind-bending art of Meow Wolf in Santa Fe.

It was a stark reminder that even the most exciting travel plans can unravel over the smallest, furry details. It makes you appreciate the quiet heroes who make our adventures possible.
