"Dust off that old 90's MTB: A Gravel Bike Conversion Story

As I stood in my garage, staring at my trusty old 90's MTB, I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. The bike that had taken me on countless adventures through muddy trails and winding forest roads was now collecting dust. But as I began to think about getting back into cycling, I realized that my old friend could be repurposed for a new passion - gravel biking.

I started brainstorming ways to convert my MTB into a gravel bike, and one question kept popping up: what about the shifters? The original friction shifters were still functional, but I wasn't sure if they'd be the best choice for a gravel bike. I began to research whether I could swap them out for something more modern, like drop bar shifters that could work with my existing MTB derailleurs. Has anyone else done a similar conversion? What were your experiences? I'm excited to breathe new life into my old bike and hit the gravel roads."
