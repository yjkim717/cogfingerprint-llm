Of all the days of the week, Saturday mornings in 2021 held a special kind of quiet. The world was still holding its breath, and in that stillness, our little online community would gather for what we called “Saturday Shares.” It was a sacred space, a digital campfire where people would volunteer to tell their stories of sobriety. We’d read about first 30 days, about hard-won years, and the simple, profound joy of a clear-headed morning.

But recently, our moderators announced a change. We’re moving away from the scheduled, formal volunteer stories. Instead, anyone can share their reflections anytime, and we’ll gather them up each week. At first, I worried. Would we lose that structure, that reliable weekly anchor?

Then I remembered my own story. My path hasn’t been a straight line. There was a relapse a couple of years back that felt like a total failure. But sharing that story here—the fear, the shame, and the slow climb back—was what truly solidified my recovery. It wasn’t a polished, scheduled post; it was a messy, necessary truth that spilled out on a random Tuesday.

This new, open model feels like that. It’s an acknowledgment that healing and struggle don’t operate on a calendar. Our need for connection and to be heard can strike at any moment. By opening the floor, we’re not losing our anchor; we’re building a bigger, more responsive harbor. It’s a beautiful reminder that our community isn’t defined by a schedule, but by its ever-beating, supportive heart, ready to listen whenever we’re ready to speak.
