Last year, my friend’s health scare with uncontrolled diabetes hit hard. They were struggling, financially stretched and overwhelmed. I knew I had to help, so I spent a weekend batch-cooking low-carb diabetic meals for their freezer. It wasn’t just about food—it was a lifeline, a way to show I cared without adding pressure. Seeing the relief on their face reminded me how small, tangible acts can anchor someone in a storm. Sometimes, the simplest meal prep carries the deepest nourishment.
