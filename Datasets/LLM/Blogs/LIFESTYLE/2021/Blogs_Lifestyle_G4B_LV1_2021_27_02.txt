**The Layers of a Mask**

It’s funny, isn’t it? I’ve been obsessing over fictional characters lately – really digging into their motivations, the little tells. It reminded me of Tobias, that actor I read about.

Are we truly seeing each other, or just analyzing the performance? 2021 felt like a year of questioning everything, didn’t it?
