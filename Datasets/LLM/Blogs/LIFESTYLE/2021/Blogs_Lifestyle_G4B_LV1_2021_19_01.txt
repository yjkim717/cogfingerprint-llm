**The Obsession & The Angle**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Late 2021, and I was completely consumed with building my own PC. Not for *need*, really, but for the sheer satisfaction of it. Hours spent researching LGA1700 compatibility, agonizing over CPU cooler choices – specifically, that Corsair AIO looked *perfect*.  I was so focused on the angles, the specs, the build itself, that I almost missed the simple joy of just… existing.  A little reminder to step back and appreciate the process, not just the result.
