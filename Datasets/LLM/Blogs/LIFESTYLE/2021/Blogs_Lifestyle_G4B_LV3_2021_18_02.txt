**Giving a Ghost a New Life**

It’s funny how certain objects hold a little piece of someone’s history, isn’t it? I recently inherited my grandfather’s old mountain bike – a sturdy, slightly battered thing from the early 90s.  It sat in the garage for years, a silent reminder of his adventurous spirit.  This year, 2021, I decided to do something a little crazy: I’m converting it into a gravel bike. 

Honestly, it feels a bit like breathing new life into a ghost. The idea of tackling my daily commute – a mix of city streets and surprisingly rough paths – on this vintage machine is… exhilarating.  Right now, I'm wrestling with finding the perfect shifters; I want something that feels solid and reliable, something that honors the bike’s original design. 

It’s more than just a bike build, though. It’s about connecting with my grandfather's passion and finding a deeper appreciation for the simple joy of riding.  Plus, there’s a definite satisfaction in tackling a DIY project and creating something truly unique.  Wish me luck – and send good vibes for a smooth ride!
