The first snowflake forecast of 2021, and the grocery store descends into chaos. I’m restocking the bread aisle, watching carts overflow with milk and loaves as if we’re preparing for a month-long siege, not a dusting that’ll melt by noon.

It’s funny—after the real uncertainty we’ve faced, this feels like a strange, collective exhale. We’re not panicking over a pandemic or lockdowns this time, just snow. Maybe it’s comforting to overprepare for something simple, something predictable.

Still, as I watch a woman cradle her seventh gallon of milk, I can’t help but smile. We’re all just doing our best, even if our best sometimes looks a little extra.
