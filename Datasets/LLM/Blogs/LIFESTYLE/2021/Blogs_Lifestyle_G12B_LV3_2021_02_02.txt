## The Quest for the Perfect Telescope Case (and a Little About Patience)

It's 2021, and my little hobby of backyard astronomy is really taking off! But transporting my Celestron telescope – the OTA and that hefty fork mount – has become a genuine challenge. Finding a carrying case that *actually* fits is proving surprisingly difficult. It’s a small frustration, sure, but it’s a good reminder that even pursuing passions requires a bit of patience and persistent searching. Anyone else relate to the hunt for the perfect gear?
