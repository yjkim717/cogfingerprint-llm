As we navigated the challenges of 2021, the power of music to bring people together became more apparent than ever. A remarkable example of this was a 10-hour virtual benefit concert held in memory of Andriko Bilaniuk, a talented young musician who left an indelible mark on those who knew him. The event, which aimed to endow a music scholarship at Bishop O'Connell High School, showcased the enduring spirit of classical music and its ability to transcend borders and boundaries. As I reflect on the significance of this fundraiser, I'm reminded of the importance of music education in our lives. It's not just about the technical skills, but about the way it can shape our perspectives, foster empathy, and create a sense of community. The outpouring of support for this virtual concert was a testament to the impact one person can have, and the difference that music can make in our lives.
