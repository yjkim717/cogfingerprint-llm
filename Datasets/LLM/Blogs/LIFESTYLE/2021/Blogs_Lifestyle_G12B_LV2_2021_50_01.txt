## The Unexpected Joy of Tiny Lists

Remember peak lockdown? I was drowning in endless scrolling, feeling utterly disconnected. Then, on a whim, I started a simple Excel list of shops I admired – little online boutiques, cool stationery stores… It felt silly, but building that list, and *actually* researching them, brought me a surprising sense of focus and joy. Sometimes, the smallest projects are the most grounding, right? Anyone else find solace in unexpected lists?
