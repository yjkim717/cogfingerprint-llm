When my partner and I sat down to merge our finances in 2021, the big question wasn't just about budgeting—it was about trust. Should I add them as an authorized user on my card or open a joint checking account? We chose the latter, turning our separate streams into one shared river. It’s been a lesson in transparency and teamwork, making every coffee run and bill payment a small act of unity. Sometimes, the right financial choice isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about building a life together, one transaction at a time.
