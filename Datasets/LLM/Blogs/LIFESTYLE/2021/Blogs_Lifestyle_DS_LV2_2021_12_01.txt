### The Quest for a Good Night's Sleep

2021 was the year I finally decided to tackle my sleep apnea. My doctor prescribed a CPAP machine, and I naively thought my problems were solved. The reality? I felt like I was wrestling a robotic octopus every night.

My beard made getting a good seal a nightmare, and I’m a champion mouth-breather. I’d wake up with a Sahara-dry mouth and a mask mark that looked like I’d been in a fight.

My journey became a quest for comfort. I tried every full-face mask, nasal pillow, and even a chin strap that made me look like a confused boxer. It was frustrating, but each failed attempt taught me something new about what my body needed.

It wasn't just about a machine; it was about reclaiming my rest. Finding the right combination—for me, a nasal cushion and a simple strap—felt like a victory. The quiet hum of the machine is no longer an annoyance, but the sound of a peaceful night ahead.
