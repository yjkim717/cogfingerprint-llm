>## The Algorithm Knows Me Better Than I Do Sometimes

Okay, so I just spent a solid hour down a Netflix rabbit hole. It started with *Searching* – that whole found-footage, computer-screen thriller? Brilliant! Then *Unfriended: Dark Web* pulled me in. It got me thinking: how much of our lives *are* just data points now? I mean, Netflix is practically predicting my entertainment needs. It’s a little unsettling, honestly, how accurately it knows I crave suspense and a good tech twist. Makes you wonder what else it’s tracking, right? 2021 feels…digitally intimate.
