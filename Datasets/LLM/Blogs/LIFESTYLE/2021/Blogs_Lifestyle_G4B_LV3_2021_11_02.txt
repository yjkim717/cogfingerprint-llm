**The Cloud, My Couch, and a Bold Leap**

2021 felt… different, didn’t it? The world was still adjusting to a new normal, and I was feeling it too. I’d been a network engineer for years, comfortable in my routine, but a quiet yearning started to grow – a desire for more flexibility, for the freedom of remote work. 

Suddenly, the idea of cloud computing, specifically AWS, felt less like a tech buzzword and more like a potential pathway. I started researching, diving into the certifications, particularly the Solution Architect track – a seemingly huge mountain to climb! 

It’s a little daunting, honestly. Balancing this pursuit with my current life feels like a delicate dance.
