## The Guitar Upgrade Question: When Does More Money *Really* Mean More Music?

Okay, so I’ve been obsessing. Probably a familiar feeling, right? Lately, it’s been about my guitar. I started playing on a pretty basic model, a real workhorse, but I’m feeling the itch for an upgrade. The question swirling in my head (and draining my bank account research) is: at what point does spending more *actually* translate to a better playing experience? 

It’s a 2021 thing, I think – this constant pressure to optimize everything. But is a $3,000 guitar *really* going to make me a better musician than a $800 one? Or am I just chasing a feeling? I’m hoping to find that sweet spot where the value matches the improvement, and maybe, just maybe, unlock a little more musical joy. Anyone else been down this rabbit hole?
