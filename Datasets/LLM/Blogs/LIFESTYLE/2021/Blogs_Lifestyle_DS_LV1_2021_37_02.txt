It’s 2021, and I’m still trying to figure out this whole “bettering myself” thing. With my ADHD brain and no therapist in sight thanks to insurance hurdles, I’ve turned my living room into a makeshift therapy space—complete with a stack of self-help books. Some days, it feels empowering; others, lonely. But flipping through those pages, I’m learning to be my own guide, one chapter at a time. It’s not perfect, but it’s progress.
