## The Quest for Channel Control (and a Little Sanity)

Okay, so I dove into the world of the Boss Katana amp this year â€“ loving the sound, honestly! But then I went down the rabbit hole of switching pedals, hoping for seamless channel changes.

Anyone else wrestling with gear and a little bit of 2021 chaos?
