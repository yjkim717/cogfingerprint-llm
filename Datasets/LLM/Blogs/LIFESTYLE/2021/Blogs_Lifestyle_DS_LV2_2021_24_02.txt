It’s 2021, and I’ll admit, the word “blockchain” used to make my eyes glaze over. But lately, I’ve felt this quiet pull to understand the new architecture of our world, the way I once learned to navigate social media. It’s not just about crypto prices; it’s about a whole ecosystem being built in real-time. My quest began not with complex whitepapers, but with a simple desire to find a clear path through the noise. It feels less like studying tech and more like learning a new way to see.
