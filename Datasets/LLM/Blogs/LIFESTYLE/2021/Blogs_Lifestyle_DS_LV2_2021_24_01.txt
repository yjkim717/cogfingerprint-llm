Of course, here is a reflective blog post that connects the theme of problem-solving in technology to a broader life lesson.

### The Wrong Kind of Puzzle

You know that feeling when you’re trying to solve a puzzle, and you’re convinced you have all the right pieces, but the picture just won’t come together? That was me yesterday, hunched over my laptop at 10 PM, glaring at a blinking cursor in a PowerShell script.

I was on a simple mission: scrape some local branch addresses from a website. A few neat commands, a bit of logic, and bam—I’d have my list. Instead, I found myself in a digital rabbit hole, trying to force two pieces of a URL to fit together. `Invoke-WebRequest` this, `href` that… it was technical gibberish that had morphed into a personal vendetta. The answer was *right there*, I could feel it, but my code kept spitting out errors.

I finally gave up and closed the laptop, the frustration clinging to me like static. This was in 2021, a year that already felt like one long, unsolvable puzzle. We were all trying to piece together a new way of living, of working, of *being_.

The next morning, making coffee in the quiet kitchen, the solution hit me. Not the code—the real lesson. I’d been so focused on forcing my way through the problem, I’d forgotten to step back. I was trying to build the entire staircase at once instead of just laying the next brick.

Life’s like that, isn’t it? We get so tangled in the immediate struggle—the messy URL components of our day—that we forget the problem often isn't the goal, but our white-knuckled grip on how to get there. Sometimes, the most productive step isn't another frantic attempt, but a deep breath and a fresh cup of coffee. The addresses could wait. My peace of mind couldn't.
