**The Weight of “Just Be Strong”**

2021 felt…heavy. I watched so many friends navigate loss – a sudden job change, a family illness, the quiet fading of a loved one. And a frustrating pattern kept repeating: they’d brush off their sadness, insisting they were “just being strong.” It’s a well-meaning sentiment, I know, but it completely missed the point. 

Honestly, it felt like a barrier, preventing them from seeking the support they desperately needed. We don't have mandated mental health care where we are, which makes it even harder to prioritize it. It’s easy to tell someone to “pull themselves together,” but grief isn’t a switch you can simply flip. 

I started gently pushing for therapy, reminding them that asking for help isn’t weakness – it’s a sign of incredible strength.  It’s a reminder that tending to our mental health is just as vital as tending to our physical well-being.
