### When the Past Feels Too Heavy

Lately, my research into butch history has felt less like an academic project and more like an emotional excavation. I’ve been diving into personal accounts, into the raw narratives that books like *Stone Butch Blues* are built on, and the weight of it all has been sitting on my chest.

It’s 2021, and in many ways, our queer world feels more open than ever. But reading these stories—of coded language, of survival, of sheer bravery in the face of violence—is a stark reminder of the foundation we stand on. I found myself needing to step away from the screen, the sadness of that historical trauma becoming a palpable thing in my quiet apartment.

It made me realize that connecting with our history isn't always a warm, affirming hug. Sometimes, it’s a gut punch. It’s the heavy price of knowing. But in that grief, I also find a fierce, profound connection—a thread linking my own questioning of gender and identity to a lineage of people who had to fight just to breathe. It’s a complicated inheritance, but it’s ours. And that, I’m learning, is everything.
