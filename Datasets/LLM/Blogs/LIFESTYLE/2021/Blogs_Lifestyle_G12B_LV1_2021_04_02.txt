>## When My Prayer Plant Taught Me About Letting Go (and Watering Yourself)

It's been a rough couple of months, hasn't it? 2021 feels like a year of constant hustle, a relentless to-do list that never quite shrinks. I was feeling it too, stretched thin and a little…limp. Like my prayer plant, actually.

I noticed it a few weeks ago – its usually vibrant, expressive leaves drooping dramatically. It looked utterly defeated. I’d been so focused on *doing* – work deadlines, online courses, trying to be a good friend, a good partner – that I’d completely neglected my little green companion. I’d forgotten to water it. Properly. 

It felt like a silly thing to be upset about, a plant! But staring at those drooping leaves, I saw a reflection of myself. I’d been so busy pouring energy into everything *but* myself that I’d dried out. 

So, I gave it a good soak, repotted it into a clay pot (apparently, that helps with drainage!), and started paying attention. And you know what? Slowly, it’s bouncing back. The leaves are starting to lift, reaching for the light again.

This whole experience has been a surprisingly poignant reminder. We can't pour from an empty cup. We need to nurture ourselves, to create space, to remember the simple things – like watering a plant, or, you know, taking a breath. Maybe 2021 is the year I learn to propagate a little self-care.
