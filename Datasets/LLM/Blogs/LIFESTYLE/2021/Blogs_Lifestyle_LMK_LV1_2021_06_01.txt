"City living has its perks, but the noise isn't one of them. The other day, I was sipping coffee in my downtown Jersey City apartment when a loud roaring shook the windows. I rushed to the balcony and was shocked to see a pair of fighter jets screaming overhead. It was exhilarating, yet a harsh reminder of the military presence in our backyard. Still, it's a memory that sticks with me - a thrilling break from the daily grind."
