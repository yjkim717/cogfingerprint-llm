It’s 2021, and I’m still chasing that perfect balance—between work and play, creativity and logic. My search for a ThinkPad to dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows feels symbolic: one side for building, the other for dreaming. As a student diving into web development, I crave a machine that’s as versatile as my ambitions. Some days, it’s code; others, it’s light gaming or essays. In this hybrid life, maybe the right tools help us bridge more than just operating systems.
