As I bopped along to my favorite Japanese band's latest album in 2021, I realized I'd become so obsessed with their music that I'd overlooked a glaring issue - I don't speak Japanese! I'd been deciphering song titles and guessing lyrics for years, but it wasn't until I stumbled upon an L4Adventure forum that I connected with fellow fans who shared my curiosity. Despite the language barrier, our shared passion for the band's haunting melodies and rhythms sparked a deeper appreciation for their art. It just goes to show that music can be a universal language, transcending borders and words.
