The scent of smoke still lingers in the air, a stubborn reminder of the wildfire that swept through our valley last month. We bought this house in early 2021, thinking it was our forever home, a quiet anchor in a chaotic world. Then the fires came, and with them, an unexpected crossroads.

We needed two appraisals for insurance, and the numbers left us speechless. In less than a year, our home’s value had skyrocketed by over 40%. Suddenly, the “what ifs” started swirling. What if we sold? We’ve already had letters from cash buyers, eager and ready. Refinancing is on the table, too, unlocking equity without ever leaving.

It feels surreal. A potential shortcut on our journey to financial independence appeared not from a stock tip or a side hustle, but from the very disaster that threatened our stability. My husband and I lie awake at night, talking in hushed tones. Do we cash out on this tragic luck and accelerate our dreams? Or do we stay in the home we’ve poured our hearts into? It’s a strange, weighty gift, born from ashes, forcing us to define what “security” truly means.
