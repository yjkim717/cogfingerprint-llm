## The Unexpected Detour

Remember when "adulting" felt like a straight line? College was done, career path mapped… or so I thought. Lately, I've been wrestling with a big decision: joining the Army. It’s a total pivot, fueled partly by a desire for structure, partly by a yearning for something *more*. There's this nagging detail too – a thigh tattoo I got years ago. Will it even be a factor? It feels strange to be questioning impulsive choices from my twenties as I consider this potentially life-altering path. 2021, huh? Life's full of surprises.
