"Leveling Up My Aquarium Game: Lessons from a DIY Disaster

As I sat in front of my aquarium in 2021, watching the water level drop, I realized I needed an auto top-off system. So, I took the DIY route, building a system with a float switch, relay, and water pump. It was a fun project, but boy, did I learn a valuable lesson. The float switch turned out to be a weak link, with a tolerance that was more like a suggestion. It would often get stuck, or trigger too early or late, causing more problems than it solved. I was left scrambling to adjust and fine-tune the system. In the end, it was a great learning experience. I now appreciate the importance of precision in DIY projects, especially when it comes to water and electronics. Has anyone else had a similar experience with DIY aquarium projects? I'd love to hear your stories!"
