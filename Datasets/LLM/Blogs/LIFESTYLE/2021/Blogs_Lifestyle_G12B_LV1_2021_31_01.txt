## The Great Kitchen Purge of 2021 (and Why It Matters)

Okay, confession time: my kitchen has been a disaster zone. Not a charming, rustic disaster, but a genuinely stressful one. It's been a slow burn of chaos, really, stemming from habits ingrained in me from childhood. My parents, bless their hearts, were *enthusiastic* about stocking up. Think three jars of peanut butter, five boxes of pasta, and enough canned goods to survive a small apocalypse. 

It wasn’t malicious, just… a different approach to grocery shopping. And somehow, that tendency rubbed off on me. This year, though, something snapped. Surrounded by towering piles of forgotten spices and mystery cans, I realised I was recreating a system that actively made me anxious.

So, I embarked on a Great Kitchen Purge of 2021. It was surprisingly emotional! Letting go of those half-used bags of lentils felt like abandoning a promise. But the relief of actually *seeing* my countertops? Priceless. 

It’s more than just decluttering, though. It's about breaking cycles, consciously choosing a calmer, more intentional way of living. And honestly, with everything else going on in 2021, a little kitchen sanity felt like a major victory.
