As I tidied up my living space in 2021, I stumbled upon an old physics textbook. A passage about lasers stuck with me - when a laser beam is split, phase-shifted, and recombined, it cancels out. It made me ponder: what gets cancelled out in our lives? Unwanted habits? Negative thoughts? Just like energy conservation in thermodynamics, perhaps our lives too have an underlying balance. I felt inspired to simplify my own life, letting go of what's no longer needed.
