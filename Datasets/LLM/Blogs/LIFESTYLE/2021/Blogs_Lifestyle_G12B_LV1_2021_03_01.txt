## The Weight of Things (and Why I'm Ditching Some)

Okay, so 2021 has been… a lot. I think we all feel that, right? And lately, I've been feeling this weird pressure to *accumulate*. More stuff, more experiences, more… everything. It’s exhausting.

Then I stumbled across a blog about thru-hiking the Continental Divide Trail. This person was meticulously planning, shaving ounces off their pack, obsessing over ultralight gear. It struck me – they were intentionally *removing* weight to lighten their load. 

It’s a metaphor, isn’t it? 

I'm not planning a thru-hike anytime soon, but the idea of paring down, of consciously letting go, really resonated. I’ve started small, donating clothes I haven’t worn in a year, unsubscribing from endless email lists. It's surprisingly freeing. Maybe lightening my mental load, shedding some of that accumulated pressure, is exactly what I need to navigate 2022 with a little more ease. Less baggage, more forward movement.
