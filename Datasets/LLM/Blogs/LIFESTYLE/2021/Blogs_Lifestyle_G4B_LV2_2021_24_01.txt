**The Quiet Obsession with Maps**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple interest can pull you down a rabbit hole. Last year, 2021, I found myself utterly captivated by mapping. Not just looking at pretty satellite images, but *understanding* how places were connected. 

It started with a frustrating task – trying to find every Nationwide branch near me. I was wrestling with a ridiculously complicated website, and it sparked this weird urge to systematically pull data. I ended up diving into PowerShell, learning how to ‘scrape’ information, like pulling addresses from a website. 

It felt a bit obsessive, I’ll admit. But there’s something deeply satisfying about taking a chaotic, digital landscape and making it…clear.  It’s a little like organizing my closet – suddenly, everything has a place, and I feel a little more in control. 

Maybe it’s a reflection of wanting to map out my own life a little better.  Finding my “branches” – the things that truly matter.  What’s your quiet obsession?
