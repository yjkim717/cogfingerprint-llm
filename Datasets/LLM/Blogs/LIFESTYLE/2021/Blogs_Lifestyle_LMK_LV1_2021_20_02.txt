As a high school junior in 2021, I was on a mission to nail the Virginia Governor's School theater audition. I devoured acting tips online, practiced my monologues until I could recite them in my sleep, and sought advice from seasoned thespians. The audition process was nerve-wracking, but with persistence and dedication, I felt prepared. If you're facing a similar challenge, remember that it's okay to be nervous - it's a sign you're pushing yourself to grow.
