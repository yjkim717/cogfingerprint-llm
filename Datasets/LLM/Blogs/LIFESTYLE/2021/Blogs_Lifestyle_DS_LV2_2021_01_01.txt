They say losing builds character, but my 24-game ranked free fall in VALORANT—Plat 3 to Gold 3 in 2021—was pure agony. It wasn't just about the rank; it was a brutal lesson in ego. That final, desperate win taught me more about resilience than any victory ever could. Sometimes, you have to hit rock bottom to remember how to climb.
