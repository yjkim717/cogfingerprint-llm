"When Tech Takes a Snooze... and Won't Wake Up Right"

I was in the middle of a productive day in 2021, working from home as many of us were, when my PC decided to get a bit too comfortable in sleep mode. The problem wasn't just that it woke up randomly - it was that my peripherals, like my keyboard and mouse, remained stubbornly asleep, leaving me staring at a frozen screen. The only solution? A hard reboot. Frustrating, to say the least. It got me thinking about the parallels between our tech and our own lives. How often do we find ourselves stuck, frozen in a state of dormancy, unresponsive to the world around us? Just as my PC needed a reboot to get back on track, sometimes we need to shake things up, restart our routines, or re-evaluate our priorities to get back to living. Has your tech ever mirrored your life in unexpected ways?
