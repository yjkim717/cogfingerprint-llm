The Guilty Pleasure of Heady Topper: A Lesson in Appreciation

As a self-proclaimed craft beer enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing. But sometimes, my enthusiasm gets the better of me, and I end up overlooking the significance of the moment. That's exactly what happened when I had the chance to try the infamous Heady Topper at a friend's house.

I recall walking into my friend's living room, popping the cap on the bottle, and taking a sip without giving it a second thought. It wasn't until later, when my friend mentioned that Heady Topper is a Vermont staple and a highly-rated Double IPA, that I felt a pang of guilt. I had essentially treated this revered beer like any other, without appreciating its craftsmanship or the hype surrounding it.

As I reflected on my carefree attitude, I realized that I'd been making a lifestyle mistake. In my haste to try new beers, I'd lost sight of the experience itself. I'd been focusing on checking off boxes on my "beers to try" list rather than savoring the moment. Heady Topper, it turns out, is more than just a beer â€“ it's an experience. It's about appreciating the nuances of the brew, the company you're with, and the atmosphere.

That night, I learned a valuable lesson: to slow down and appreciate the little things. It's not just about trying new beers; it's about being present in the moment. As I continue my craft beer journey in 2021, I've made a conscious effort to be more mindful of my experiences. And when I finally get my hands on another Heady Topper, I'll be sure to savor every sip.
