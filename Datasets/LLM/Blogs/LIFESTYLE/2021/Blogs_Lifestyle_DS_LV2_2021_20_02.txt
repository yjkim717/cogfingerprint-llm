The memory still gives me chills. Fall 2021, my junior year, and I was a bundle of nerves preparing for the Governor's School theater audition. My acting coach had secured an adjudication slot, which felt like both a golden ticket and a looming judgment day. I remember practicing monologues in my bedroom, the four walls my only audience. It was more than an audition; it was a collision of ambition and fear, a moment that truly defined that strange, hopeful year.
