That first year of the pandemic felt like my wheels were just spinning. I was burning rubber, full of anxious energy, trying to launch into a dozen new projects at once, but I wasn't getting any traction. It was all smoke and noise. Then, I finally stopped fighting the stillness. I settled into a slower, steady paceâ€”a daily walk, reading actual books. It was in that gentle forward motion that I finally found my grip and started moving meaningfully forward, leaving the frantic burnout behind for good.
