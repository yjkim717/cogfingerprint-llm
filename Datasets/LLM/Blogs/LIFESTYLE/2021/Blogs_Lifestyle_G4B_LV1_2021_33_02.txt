**Lost in the Echoes of “Butch”**

Okay, so I’m completely consumed with this screenplay idea – a woman who can time travel, but her biggest struggle isn’t paradoxes or changing the past, it’s *being* a butch in different eras. It’s proving unexpectedly… intense. 

I started researching, naturally, and stumbled upon a lot of fascinating stuff about the historical butch identity. It’s so much more than just a style; it’s a deeply rooted form of gender expression, a way of existing that’s been fiercely guarded and often misunderstood. 

Honestly, digging into the emotional landscape of these women – the resilience, the quiet defiance, and the moments of profound distress – has hit me hard.  It’s a reminder that even across time, the feeling of not quite fitting in, of facing judgment, can be a constant.  I’m trying to honor that, and I’m realizing this isn’t just a screenplay; it’s a conversation.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adding a particular detail?
