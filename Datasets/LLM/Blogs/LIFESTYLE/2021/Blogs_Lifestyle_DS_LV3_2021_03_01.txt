The worn-out gear in my closet tells a story—one of addiction, of chasing highs that left me hollow. But in 2021, I traded one kind of chase for another: the Continental Divide Trail. Sul from the hiking forums would laugh at my theoretical ultralight setup now—every ounce pared down, every item chosen with intention.

My budget was tight, but my resolve was lighter. I’m still figuring out bear safety and final gear picks, but this time, the only thing I’m addicted to is the horizon. On the CDT, I’m not running from myself; I’m walking toward who I’m meant to be.
