It’s funny—in 2021, I thought I’d mastered home projects. Then came the garage siding. I bought those neat little clips, drilled in confidently, and hung my tools, proud as ever. A week later, they wobbled like loose teeth.

Turns out, I’d missed the caulk seal, leaving tiny gaps for moisture to creep in. It wasn’t just about hanging things; it was a reminder that shortcuts often cost more time. I redid it all, slower this time, sealing each hole carefully. Now, every time I glance at those securely mounted tools, I smile. Sometimes, the smallest fixes teach the biggest lessons in patience and care.
