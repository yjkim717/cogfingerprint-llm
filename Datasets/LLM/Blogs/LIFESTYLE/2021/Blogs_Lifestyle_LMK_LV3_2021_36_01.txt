"As I juggled my Linux and Windows worlds in 2021, I faced a familiar dilemma: finding a filesystem that could keep up with my needs. With dual booting, I wanted a storage solution that wouldn't compromise on performance or compatibility. After some digging, I discovered filesystems like NTFS and exFAT that bridged the gap between the two operating systems. By choosing the right filesystem, I was able to streamline my workflow and enjoy a seamless experience across both Linux and Windows - a small tweak that made a big difference in my tech-savvy lifestyle."
