>## The Unexpected Anxiety of Online Kpop Merch

Okay, so I'm officially admitting it: I get *excited* about online shopping. Especially when it involves Kpop merch. I’d been eyeing a gorgeous poster from taitoufr for ages, and finally took the plunge to order two. Everything seemed smooth, until I realized I’d accidentally used bank transfer instead of my card. 

Suddenly, a wave of anxiety washed over me. What if something went wrong? What if they didn't receive the transfer? It’s silly, I know, but in 2021, with all the online scams out there, it’s hard *not* to overthink things. Thankfully, a quick Reddit search calmed my nerves - apparently, it's a common issue! Now, just waiting for that poster to arrive!
