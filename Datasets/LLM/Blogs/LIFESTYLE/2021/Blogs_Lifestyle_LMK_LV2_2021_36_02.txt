"Still Dealing with the Fallout: My HSA Nightmare"

As I sat down to tackle my 2020 taxes, I was hit with a wave of déjà vu. For the second year in a row, my employer had messed up my Health Savings Account (HSA) contributions, triggering an inquiry from the IRS. I'd thought I'd put the stress of 2019 behind me, but here I was again, scrambling to get everything sorted. It's 2021, and you'd think that administrative errors like this would be a thing of the past. But nope, it seems some things are still stuck in the slow lane. I'm not alone in this struggle, I'm sure. Has anyone else out there had to deal with the headache of HSA errors and IRS red tape? It's a frustrating reminder that even with the best intentions, things don't always go as planned.
