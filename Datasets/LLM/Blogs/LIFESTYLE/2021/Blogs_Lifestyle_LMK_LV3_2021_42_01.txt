The Great Snow Panic of 2021 - a tale of retail chaos and collective overreaction. As a retail worker, I've seen customers rush to stores in a frenzy, snatching up essentials and leaving empty shelves in their wake. The trigger? A predicted light dusting of snow. It's baffling to watch normally rational people succumb to panic buying, transforming a minor weather event into a shopping extravaganza. The result is crowded stores, long queues, and a sense of frustration that lingers long after the snowflakes have melted. As I restock shelves and calm frazzled nerves, I wonder: have we lost our sense of proportion? Are we so conditioned to expect the worst that we overreact at the slightest provocation? As the snow melts away, I'm left pondering the psychology behind our collective panic and the impact it has on our daily lives.
