## Butterflies and Backstages: Facing a Big Audition

Okay, deep breaths everyone. It’s 2021, and I’m staring down a pretty big deal – an audition for the Virginia Governor’s School for Theater. As a junior, this feels like a *huge* step. Honestly, the nerves are real! I’ve been pouring over monologues, trying to channel my inner Meryl Streep (a girl can dream, right?). 

Anyone else ever feel that mix of excitement and sheer terror before a big performance? I’m hoping to connect with some seasoned actors out there – any words of wisdom for a hopeful thespian?
