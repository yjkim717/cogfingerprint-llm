It’s funny how a single sheet of paper can make you question everything. Last week, our home appraisal came in—up a staggering 45% from just last year. My husband and I stared at the numbers, the same ones that now whisper, “Your FIRE journey could be over, like, tomorrow.”

For years, we’ve been diligently saving, dreaming of the day we’d achieve Financial Independence and Retire Early. We pictured it as a slow, steady climb. But 2021’s insane real estate boom just dropped a rocket in our laps. Suddenly, selling to one of those all-cash buyers flooding the market doesn’t just feel possible; it feels urgent.

But is it the right move? This house holds our daughter’s first steps, lazy Sunday coffees, and the garden we nurtured from scratch. Do we trade these memories for a giant leap toward freedom? My head is spinning with spreadsheets, but my heart is still here, in these four walls. The biggest question isn't about the market anymore—it's about what we’re truly building: just a nest egg, or a life we love?
