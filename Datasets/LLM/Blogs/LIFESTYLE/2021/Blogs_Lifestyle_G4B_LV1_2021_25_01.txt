**The Weight of Unanswered**

Remember those late nights in 2021, glued to the screen, battling it out in Apex Legends? I was obsessed, pouring hours into collecting those crafting materials. Then, *poof* – gone. It felt like a tiny, frustrating loss at the time, but it quickly spiraled into something bigger.  I reached out to EA support, and honestly, the response was… awful. Accusatory and completely unhelpful. It mirrored a feeling I’d been battling – the weight of feeling unheard, like your frustrations just get lost in the noise.  It made me realize how important genuine connection, even online, truly is.
