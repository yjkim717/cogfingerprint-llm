**The Fuzzy Line Between Fun and…Something Else**

Okay, let’s be real. 2021 was a year of tentative steps back out into the world, and a *lot* of blurry nights. I’d been pretty isolated for so long, and when the invitations started rolling in – drinks, parties, just *being* with friends – I jumped at the chance.  Too much, maybe. 

There’s this weird pressure, right? To keep the party going, to be “fun.” And sometimes, that fun involved a concerning amount of alcohol. I noticed a pattern: when people were drunk, their judgment seemed to vanish. Conversations devolved, boundaries blurred, and honestly, some of the behavior was just… unsettling. 

It made me think about friendship – about how we protect each other, and how easy it is to let someone else take the lead when they’re under the influence.  It wasn't about blaming anyone, but acknowledging a real vulnerability.  I started saying “no” more often, prioritizing my own safety and peace of mind.  It’s a constant balancing act, figuring out how to enjoy myself without sacrificing my sense of self.
