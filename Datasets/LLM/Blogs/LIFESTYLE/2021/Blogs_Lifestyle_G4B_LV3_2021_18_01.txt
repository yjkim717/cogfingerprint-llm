**The Weight of ‘What Ifs’**

It feels a little silly admitting this, but lately, I’ve been wrestling with a heavy feeling – a persistent hum of regret. 2021 was supposed to be *it*, wasn’t it? The year everything clicked into place. And while some things definitely did, a shadow of “what ifs” has been clinging to me, fueled by a relentless comparison game. 

I found myself scrolling through Instagram, seeing friends landing promotions, buying houses, and – let's be honest – looking incredibly happy. Suddenly, my own job search felt like a monumental failure and the thought of starting a family felt… daunting. The past kept pulling me back, each perceived mistake amplifying into a significant weight.

It’s a familiar cycle, isn’t it? Failure breeds regret, which feeds into depression, and that, in turn, makes it impossible to truly embrace the good things happening *now*.  I realized I was so busy dwelling on what *could* have been, I was missing the beauty of what *is*.  

This year, I’m making a conscious effort to shift my focus.  Self-improvement isn't about erasing the past; it’s about learning from it and choosing to move forward with kindness – especially towards myself. It’s about letting go of the ‘what ifs’ and truly savoring the journey, whatever it looks like.
