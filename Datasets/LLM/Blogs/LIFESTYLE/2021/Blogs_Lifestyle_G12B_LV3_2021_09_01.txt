>## Rethinking My Plate in 2021

It’s funny how a new year can feel like a fresh start, isn't it? As 2021 rolled around, I found myself really thinking about what I was putting *into* that fresh start – specifically, my food. Like so many others, I was drawn to the growing wave of plant-based eating and the idea of centering meals around vegetables. 

It wasn't about strict rules, though. More about celebrating the incredible flavors of things like pickled vegetables and fermented foods – adding a little zing and a lot of goodness. I started experimenting with vibrant salads, hearty veggie bowls, and even got into making my own sauerkraut! A little fish or chicken here and there felt perfectly balanced. It’s been a surprisingly joyful journey, and I’m curious – what are *your* food focuses this year?
