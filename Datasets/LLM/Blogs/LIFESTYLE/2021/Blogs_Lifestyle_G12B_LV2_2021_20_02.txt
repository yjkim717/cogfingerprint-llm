## Butterflies and Big Auditions

Okay, deep breaths everyone. It's that time of year again – the one filled with nervous energy and a whole lot of hope. I’m a high school junior, and I’ve got an audition coming up for Virginia’s Governor’s School for Theater. Honestly? Butterflies are practically doing backflips in my stomach! 

I've been working with an acting coach, which has been amazing, but that pre-audition jitters are real. It’s a reminder to trust the work I've put in, and remember why I love this crazy, wonderful world of theater. Wish me luck! Anyone else facing a big challenge right now? Let's send good vibes to each other.
