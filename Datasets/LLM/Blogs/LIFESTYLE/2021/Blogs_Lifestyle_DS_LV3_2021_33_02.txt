There’s a certain weight that comes with learning our history—especially when you’re butch. I remember scrolling through digital archives in 2021, reading stories of butches from decades past, and feeling this profound, quiet sadness settle in my chest. It wasn’t just about the overt discrimination or the fights for visibility; it was in the small, emotional details—the coded language they had to use, the love they couldn’t openly express, the resilience required just to exist.

That sadness isn’t despair, though. It’s connective. It’s realizing that my identity, my way of moving through the world, is built on a foundation of both struggle and strength. I think about how they found joy in secret bars and chosen families, how they carved out spaces to be fully themselves. It makes me reflect on my own life—the moments I’ve had to armor up emotionally, and the times I’ve been soft despite it all.

Honoring that history means carrying their stories forward, not as burdens, but as reminders: we’ve always been here, feeling deeply, living authentically. And in that, there’s also hope.
