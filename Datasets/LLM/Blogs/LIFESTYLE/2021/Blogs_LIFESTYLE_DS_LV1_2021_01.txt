Looking back on my 2021 college days, I sometimes wonder if I missed out by being a commuter. Sure, I saved a ton on dorming costs, but campus life always felt like a party happening just next doorâ€”one I was never quite inside. Making friends was a constant effort, a series of quick chats before racing to my car. I got my degree, but I can't help but feel I skipped the chapter on building those spontaneous, late-night bonds that seem to last a lifetime.
