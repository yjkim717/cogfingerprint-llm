## The Subway and the Saturday Night I Missed

It's 2021, and I’m still commuting to college. Practical, right? Save money, live at home, avoid the whole dorm life drama. That's what I told myself, anyway. And for the most part, it *has* been. But sometimes, late at night, staring out the train window at the blur of lights, I can’t help but feel a pang of… something. Regret, maybe?

I see snippets of what I’m missing – laughter spilling from a campus building, a group huddled around a bonfire. The "college experience" everyone talks about. The late-night pizza runs, the spontaneous adventures, the forging of friendships cemented in shared dorm room chaos. 

I traded that for a quiet apartment and a reliable commute. Was it the right choice? Probably. But occasionally, I wonder about those Saturday nights I wasn’t there, the memories I didn’t make.
