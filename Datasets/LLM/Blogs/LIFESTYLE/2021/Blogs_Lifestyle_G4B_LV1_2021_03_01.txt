**Chasing Weight, Finding Space**

2021 felt…heavy. Not physically, but in my mind. I was obsessed with shaving ounces, building an impossibly light gear list for a CDT solo trip. The “lighterpack” philosophy consumed me – every gram scrutinized. Looking back, I realize I was trying to outrun a feeling, a restlessness. 

That theoretical CDT list, with its bear canister and ultralight dreams, was a proxy for wanting to be completely self-sufficient, to control everything.  It’s funny, stripping away the weight actually freed up mental space. Now, I’m learning that sometimes, the best journeys are about embracing the *extra* – the comfort, the connection, not just the minimum.
