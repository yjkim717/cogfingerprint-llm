As I sat in front of my screen during the 10-hour virtual benefit concert in 2021, I was struck by the power of community and music. The event was a beautiful tribute to Andriko Bilaniuk, a talented young violinist who had touched the hearts of so many. The concert, held to raise funds for a music education scholarship at Bishop O'Connell High School, was a testament to the impact one person can have on others. As I listened to the classical melodies fill my room, I felt a sense of connection to the musicians and to Andriko's legacy. The evening was a poignant reminder that music has the ability to transcend borders and bring people together. It was a truly moving experience, and one that left me reflecting on the importance of nurturing young talent and the role that music plays in shaping our lives.
