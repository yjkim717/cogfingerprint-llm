**My Year of Getting Weird with Food (2021)**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of a really intense kitchen experiment. I’d been scrolling through all these “food trends” – mostly plant-based stuff and people raving about fermented foods – and I just… wanted in. I started small, swapping out meat for lentils in my usual recipes, then dove headfirst into kombucha and sauerkraut. 

It wasn’t always pretty! There were some truly epic fails (fermented watermelon, anyone?), but it was so rewarding. I found myself craving vegetables more, building meals around them instead of just adding them on. It's funny how shifting my food habits shifted my whole perspective – a little weirdness, a lot of flavour, and a surprisingly happy belly.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps create a version with a different focus?
