**Roommate Roulette: Lessons from a Chaotic Year**

Okay, 2021 was… a lot. And honestly, I needed a serious life reset. That’s why I’m finally putting myself out there and searching for roommates for a little place near uni. I’m picturing a group of “swamp buddies” – you know, the kind who are brilliant at procrastinating but also surprisingly good company. 

I’m aiming for a tidy space, a little sanctuary from the chaos.  Last year really hammered home the importance of a supportive environment, and I’m hoping to find people who value that too.  It's not just about splitting the rent; it’s about creating a genuinely good vibe.  Anyone else feeling the need for a roommate upgrade?
