That first time I unboxed my dream guitar in 2021, I expected a revelation. The rosewood felt sublime, the tone was crystalline... but my old songs sounded the same. I was chasing a gear upgrade to solve a creativity problem. The real shift wasn't in the instrument's price tag, but in the quiet, patient hours I finally dedicated to practice. The music was always in my hands, not the hardware.
