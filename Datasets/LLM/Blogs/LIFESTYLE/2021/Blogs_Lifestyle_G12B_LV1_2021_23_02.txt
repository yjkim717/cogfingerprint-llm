## The Late Nights & Shared Fridge Chronicles

Okay, so 2021 has been… a lot. Between online classes and trying to *actually* adult, I've realized a few things about myself. Mostly, I’m a certified night owl and a professional procrastinator. Seriously, deadlines are more like… suggestions in my world.

This year, I'm moving into a 3/2 at Silver Creek Apartments near UF, and the thought of navigating this whole “roommate” thing is both exciting and slightly terrifying. I’m hoping to find someone who *gets* it, you know? Someone who understands the allure of a 2 AM study session (fueled by copious amounts of coffee) and doesn’t judge when assignments are started the night before.

Honestly, I'd love to live with other women, but I’m open to anyone who’s chill, respectful, and maybe shares my appreciation for a well-stocked fridge. If you’re a fellow Gator, a lover of late nights, and embrace the beautiful chaos of procrastination, let’s chat! Maybe we can conquer this year together.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
