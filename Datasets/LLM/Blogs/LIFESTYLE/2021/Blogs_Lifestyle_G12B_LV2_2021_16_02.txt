## The Point of "Better"? A Question I'm Asking Myself

It's 2021, and we're all chasing something, right? Whether it's a fancier coffee machine or, in my case, a guitar upgrade. I've been eyeing a nicer instrument, something in the €500-€800 range. But lately, I’ve been wondering: at what point does spending more *actually* get you more? Does a higher price tag truly translate to a drastically better sound or a significantly smoother feel? 

It's more than just guitars, isn't it? It’s about the constant push for "better" in every aspect of life. Maybe contentment lies not in the upgrade, but in appreciating what we already have. Food for thought, I reckon.
