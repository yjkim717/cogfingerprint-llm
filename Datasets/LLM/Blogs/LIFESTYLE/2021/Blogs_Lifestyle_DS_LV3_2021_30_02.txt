### The Unseen Battle: My Two-Week War on a Wart

So, I finally joined the millions who’ve battled a stubborn wart. In 2021, my new year’s resolution was self-care, but I didn’t think it would involve a nightly date with a box of Compound W. Let me tell you, it’s a humbling experience.

The little salicylic acid pad is supposed to be the hero, but my first challenge was just getting it to stay put! It’s like trying to keep a tiny, medicated bandage on a slippery pebble. After a few days, a tough, white callus formed—a fortress my wart built against the treatment. I’d gently file it down with a pumice stone, feeling like an amateur archaeologist uncovering… well, the same stubborn wart.

Two weeks in, and progress is glacial. I stare at it, willing it to disappear, wondering if I’m doing something wrong. It’s a weirdly personal lesson in patience. This tiny spot on my skin has become a daily reminder that some fixes aren’t instant; they’re a slow, persistent campaign. Who knew wart removal could be so philosophical?
