There’s something quietly rebellious about giving new life to an old 90s mountain bike. In 2021, as the world seemed to spin a little slower, I found myself in the garage, staring at this trusty steel frame. It had seen countless trails but was now destined for a new identity: a gravel bike.

The project wasn't just about mechanics; it was a metaphor. Swapping the flat bars for sleek drop bars felt like trading comfort for possibility. Sourcing compatible shifters for those old MTB derailleurs was a puzzle, a patient search for harmony between past and present.

Each turn of the wrench was a small act of mindfulness, a break from the digital noise. And when I finally took it on that first gravel path, the wind whispering through the drops, it wasn’t just a bike I’d built—it was a reminder that we, too, can shift, adapt, and find new roads forward.
