"Losing in-game progress can be frustrating, but it's even more infuriating when support teams aren't on your side. I recall my Apex Legends crafting materials vanishing, only to be met with EA support's skepticism. Their accusation still stings - was I really being penalized for someone else's mistake? It's 2021, and I'd expect better from customer service. The experience left me questioning the value of gaming communities and the importance of empathetic support."
