It’s funny how my late-night gaming sessions on BlueStacks have started to feel like a metaphor for 2021 life. I’d spend ages tweaking the CPU cores and RAM allocation, chasing that perfect, stable FPS in Epic Seven, only to realize I was doing the same thing with my own energy. I was allocating too much "RAM" to work, leaving my personal life laggy and unresponsive.

It hit me one evening, mid-raid. I wasn’t just optimizing a game; I was trying to optimize myself into a flawless machine. But life, much like an emulator, isn't about maxing out every setting. It’s about finding the right balance so the experience doesn’t crash. I closed the settings menu and just played. For the first time in months, both the game and I felt smooth.
