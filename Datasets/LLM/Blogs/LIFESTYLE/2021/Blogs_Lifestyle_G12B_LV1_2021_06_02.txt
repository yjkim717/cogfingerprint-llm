## The Waiting Game & Finding Beauty in the Pause

Okay, so I’m officially obsessed with my new Pixel 6 Pro. The design is gorgeous, the speed is fantastic…but the camera! Honestly, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I was so excited to capture the golden hour light filtering through the autumn leaves, but then… the wait. 

Seriously, sometimes it takes 20-30 seconds for a single photo to process, especially if it's a low-light shot. It’s jarring, a stark contrast to the instant gratification I'm used to. At first, it frustrated me. I felt like I was missing the moment. 

But then I started to see it differently. This pause, this little waiting game, has actually made me *more* present. I’m observing the light, the details, the scene itself, instead of just snapping and moving on. Maybe slowing down isn't so bad after all. Maybe it’s a lesson in appreciating the quiet beauty around me.
