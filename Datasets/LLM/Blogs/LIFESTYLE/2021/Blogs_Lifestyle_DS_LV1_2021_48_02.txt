Navigating United’s upgrade maze for my aunt’s flight from Singapore last year reminded me how travel mirrors life. We plan meticulously, yet the real journey begins when plans falter. Scouring the United portal, I found no online upgrades—just like 2021 taught us to pivot gracefully. Sometimes, the best routes aren’t on the map but unfold through patience and a human touch, turning frustration into a cherished reunion ahead.
