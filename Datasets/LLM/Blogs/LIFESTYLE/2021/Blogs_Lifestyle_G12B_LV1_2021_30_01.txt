## That Feeling When You Realize You’re Being Played (and It’s Not Just on TV)

Rewatching *For All Mankind* last night – seriously, anyone else obsessed with that show? – I had a *moment*. The finale, which I thought I understood, suddenly hit different. Margo’s choices, that subtle pressure… it felt like she was being subtly steered, manipulated even. And the implication of Russian involvement? Chilling.

It got me thinking about life, you know? How often do we feel like we're just reacting, following a path laid out for us without truly questioning it? 2021 has been… a lot. So much external noise, so many expectations. I've been trying to be more mindful, to pause and really ask myself, "Why am I doing this? Whose agenda am I serving?" 

It's a little unnerving, this awareness. But maybe, just maybe, recognizing the potential for influence is the first step towards charting our own course.
