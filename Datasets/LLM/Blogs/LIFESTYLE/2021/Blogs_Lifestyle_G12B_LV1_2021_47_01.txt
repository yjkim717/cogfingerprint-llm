## Conquering the Chaos: My 2021 Time Rescue Mission

Okay, let's be honest, 2021 felt like a constant juggling act. Work deadlines, trying to stay connected with friends virtually, and just… life. I was perpetually behind, feeling overwhelmed, and battling a serious procrastination habit. Then, I stumbled upon a simple idea: intentional time blocking. 

Suddenly, my calendar wasn't just a list of appointments, but a roadmap. I started planning my day the night before, even just a rough outline. Thirty-minute blocks for focused work, fifteen-minute breaks with a quick walk, and even dedicated “unwind” slots.  It’s not perfect; sometimes things shift. But honestly, just the act of *planning* has made a huge difference. Less frantic scrambling, more feeling in control. Small steps, big impact.
