## Desert Lessons & a Very Warm Pup

This past summer, we finally took the plunge and headed out west for a camping trip. Arizona’s desert landscape had been calling my name for years, but I’ll admit, I was a *little* nervous about bringing along our then-six-month-old puppy, Finn. He’s a sweetie, but Wisconsin winters had left him utterly unprepared for that kind of heat.

It was a serious wake-up call. Even early mornings, the pavement was scorching! I quickly learned the value of dog shoes – seriously, a lifesaver. We also invested in a cooling vest, which he actually seemed to enjoy (once he got used to it!). I was so glad I remembered Musher’s Secret, too; it helped soothe his paws after a particularly rough patch of asphalt.

More than just the gear, though, it taught me a lesson in preparedness. It wasn’t just about Finn’s comfort; it was about respecting the environment and understanding its challenges. We had to constantly monitor him, adjust our plans, and prioritize his well-being. It was humbling, and ultimately, a really beautiful experience. 2021 felt like a year of learning to adapt, and this trip definitely mirrored that.
