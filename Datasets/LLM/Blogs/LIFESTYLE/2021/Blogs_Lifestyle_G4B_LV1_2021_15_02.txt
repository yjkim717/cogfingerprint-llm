**The Rush and the Missed Moment**

It’s funny how quickly life can shift, isn’t it? Back in 2021, I had a minor operation – nothing too dramatic, just a little knee repair. The hospital was lovely, the nurses were brilliant, and I was genuinely excited to get home and recover. I’d even managed to snag a signed photo of Warwick Davis – a huge inspiration for me!

But as I was being discharged, a wave of eagerness washed over me. I just *needed* to get home, start healing, and get back to my routine. I practically bolted out the door, grabbing my crutches and heading straight for the car. 

It wasn’t until later, hearing about how another patient missed a chance to meet Warwick Davis because they were rushing out, that I felt a little pang of regret. It really hammered home the importance of slowing down. Recovery isn’t about speed; it’s about listening to your body and allowing yourself the space to heal properly.  Sometimes, the best moments are the ones we don’t rush past.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a particular aspect or adjusting the length?
