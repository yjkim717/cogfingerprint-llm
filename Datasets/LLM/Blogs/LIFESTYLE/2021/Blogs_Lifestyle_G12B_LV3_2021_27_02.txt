## You Know What? Tobias Fünke Might Be a Genius.

Okay, hear me out. I was deep down a *Arrested Development* rabbit hole the other day (as one does in 2021), and a Reddit thread blew my mind. Apparently, Tobias Fünke, the perpetually-failing actor, isn't just a comedic caricature. He’s actually making surprisingly astute observations about human psychology! It got me thinking – maybe we all underestimate the wisdom hidden in unexpected places, even in the most eccentric among us. Sometimes, the funniest people are the most observant.
