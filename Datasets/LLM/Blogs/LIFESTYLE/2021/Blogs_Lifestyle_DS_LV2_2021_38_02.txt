The silence after my friend’s father passed from COVID in 2021 was deafening. I’d send a text—“Thinking of you”—and feel utterly helpless. What could my words really do against that kind of grief?

I remembered my own dark period, years prior, and how a simple suggestion from a friend to try therapy had felt like a lifeline. It wasn’t an insult, but an act of love. So, I gently mentioned it to her, framing it not as a fix, but as a space just for her—to scream, to cry, to simply be.

It’s in these raw, human moments we realize that the bravest thing we can sometimes do for someone we love is to hand them a map when they feel lost, even if we can’t walk the path for them. True support means offering a light, however small.
