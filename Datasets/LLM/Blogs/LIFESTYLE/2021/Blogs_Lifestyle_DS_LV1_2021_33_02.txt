### When History Gets Heavy: A Butch’s Guide to Self-Care

I went down a rabbit hole this week, and I’m still dusting myself off. As a butch artist, I often dive into our queer history for inspiration. This time, I was researching the lives of butches from the 70s and 80s, pulling threads from stories like *Stone Butch Blues*. The sheer weight of the trauma and violence they endured just for existing… it hit me like a ton of bricks.

Suddenly, my own daily anxieties felt both trivial and magnified. I had to step back. I closed the history books, put on my worn-out boots, and went for a long walk—no phone, no podcasts. Just the crunch of gravel under my feet and the solidness of the earth.

It’s 2021, and the fight isn’t over, but the tools are different. My ancestors survived with sheer grit; my survival now includes knowing when to log off, when to feel the sun on my face, and when to just be quiet. Honoring their struggle doesn’t mean drowning in their pain. It means living my truth, fully and fiercely, but with the self-care they were so often denied. That’s the legacy I’m choosing to build on.
