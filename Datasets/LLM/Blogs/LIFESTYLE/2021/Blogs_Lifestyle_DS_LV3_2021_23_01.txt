There’s something about that upbeat guitar and groovy beat that just hits different in 2021. I’ve been chasing that fast-paced, skateboarding vibe in music lately—tracks with rapid lyrics that make you feel like you’re cruising down an open road. It’s that perfect energy for shaking off the day’s stress and just moving, a little less electronic but just as freeing. Pure mood-lifter.
