**The Surprisingly Persistent Little Battles**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year. Between the Zoom calls, the sourdough obsession, and the general feeling of being perpetually slightly behind, I realized I was ignoring a few small, nagging things. Specifically, a particularly stubborn callus on my heel and a few tiny, annoying warts that had popped up seemingly out of nowhere. 

I’d always just… ignored them, you know? Like they were minor inconveniences. But then I stumbled across an old Compound W kit (seriously, it’s been around forever!) and decided to give it a shot. It reminded me of my mom using it when I was a kid. 

The biggest struggle was actually getting the pads to stick! And honestly, the pumice stone felt a little aggressive. It’s funny how these little things can really chip away at your confidence, even if they’re just physical.  It’s made me more mindful of taking care of myself, not just the big, obvious things.  Sometimes, the quiet battles are the most important ones to win.
