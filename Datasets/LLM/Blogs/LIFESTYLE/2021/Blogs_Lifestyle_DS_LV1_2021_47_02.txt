### The Year I Stopped Feeding the Flames

I used to think a dramatic, cinematic rebirth was the only kind that counted. You know the one—the phoenix bursting from the ashes in a glorious blaze. For most of 2021, I kept waiting for that moment, for some external event to force my transformation. But the ashes I was sitting in weren’t from a single, catastrophic fire; they were the cold, grey accumulation of a thousand small burns.

The burn of saying "yes" when my soul was screaming "no." The slow smolder of scrolling through newsfeeds that left me feeling empty and anxious. The constant, low heat of maintaining friendships that felt more like emotional labor than mutual support. I was exhausted, but I kept telling myself this was just life. I was responsible for being a good friend, for staying informed, for being reliable.

Then it hit me. My responsibility wasn't to keep all these plates spinning; my true responsibility was to myself. The phoenix doesn't rise by tending to the fire that consumes it; it rises by letting the old burn away.

So, I started making conscious sacrifices. It sounds grand, but it was painfully practical. I sacrificed the habit of immediately grabbing my phone upon waking. I sacrificed the guilt I felt when I declined an invitation from a perpetually negative friend. I sacrificed hours spent on hobbies I thought I *should* enjoy, making room for the ones that genuinely lit me up.

It wasn’t about being harsh or cutting people out vindictively. It was about a profound shift in priorities. My priority became my own peace. Letting those energy-draining habits and relationships turn to ash was the hardest part. But in that newly cleared space, I found the energy to finally hear my own voice again. My rebirth wasn't a single explosion; it was a quiet, deliberate unfolding, one prioritized choice at a time. And let me tell you, the air up here is so much clearer.
