It’s 2021, and I’ll admit it: I’ve spent more hours than I care to count scrolling, clicking, and getting absolutely nothing done. The days blurred together, and I felt busy but never truly productive. That’s when I decided to get deliberate. I started planning my week every Sunday, blocking out time for deep work, and yes, even using a simple kitchen timer. It felt rigid at first, but something shifted. That discipline carved out space not just for tasks, but for what matters—reading, creating, and connecting. Time didn’t feel like an enemy anymore. It became my most valuable ally.
