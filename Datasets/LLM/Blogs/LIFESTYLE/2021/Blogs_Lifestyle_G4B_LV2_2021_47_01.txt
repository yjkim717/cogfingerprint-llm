**The Year I Finally Met My To-Do List (Sort Of)**

2021 felt… chaotic, didn’t it? Between the pandemic shifts and just trying to figure out “adulting,” I was drowning in a sea of half-finished projects and a constant feeling of being behind. I realized I wasn't *doing*, I was just reacting. 

Then, I stumbled upon the idea of time blocking – seriously, it felt almost too good to be true. Suddenly, I started actually scheduling my days, not just letting them happen. It wasn’t perfect, of course. Procrastination still reared its ugly head (hello, endless scrolling!), but the act of planning forced me to confront my goals. 

It’s been a journey, but learning to prioritize and carve out focused time has made a huge difference.  It’s not about being a productivity guru, it’s about taking control, one block at a time.  How’s your 2022 going in this department?
