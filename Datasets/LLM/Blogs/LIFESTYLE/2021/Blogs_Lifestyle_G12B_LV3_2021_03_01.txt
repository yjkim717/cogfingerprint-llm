## Dreaming of the CDT: A Gear List and a Little Bit of Hope

It's late 2021, and the world still feels… unsteady. But lately, I've been finding solace in a wild, ambitious dream: thru-hiking the Continental Divide Trail. It’s a massive undertaking, a solo journey stretching over 3,100 miles, and the thought both terrifies and exhilarates me.

I've been buried in research, obsessively crafting a theoretical ultralight gear list. Every ounce matters when you're carrying everything you need on your back! It's become a surprisingly therapeutic process, a way to focus on something tangible amidst the uncertainty.

Right now, I'm wrestling with the snow gear – Colorado in the spring is no joke! And, of course, bear safety is top of mind. I’ve been lurking on Reddit, soaking up the wisdom of experienced thru-hikers, hoping to refine my setup and ensure I'm as prepared as possible. 

Maybe it’s just a pipe dream, but for now, planning this hike is giving me a sense of purpose and a glimmer of hope for adventure in the future.
