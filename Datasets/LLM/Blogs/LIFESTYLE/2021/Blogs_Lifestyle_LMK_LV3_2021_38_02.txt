When COVID-19 took my ex-partner's dad, it was a harsh reminder that life can change in an instant. As I watched them navigate the dark waters of grief, I wanted to be there for them, to offer some semblance of comfort. It's funny, even though we're no longer together, their pain still resonated deeply with me. I considered suggesting therapy to help them process their loss. It's 2021, and we've come to realize that mental health is just as crucial as physical health. Grief can be isolating, but with the right support, it's possible to find a way through. Therapy can be a safe space to confront emotions and work through the complex feelings that come with losing someone. If you're supporting someone through a tough time, remind them that they're not alone, and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
