### My Quest for a Good Night's Sleep (Beard Included)

Let’s be real, 2021 was the year many of us finally tackled the projects we’d been ignoring. For me, that project was sleep. My CPAP machine and I had a rocky relationship, mostly because of my beard. Every mask I tried either leaked air or felt like a vacuum seal on my face, and I’d constantly wake up with a mouth as dry as sand.

The real villain? Mouth breathing. I’d drift off, my jaw would drop, and *pffft*—there went the pressurized air, turning my throat into a desert. My solution for years was just to suffer through it. But last spring, I decided enough was enough.

I dove into online forums and discovered a game-changer: the humble chin strap. It sounded a little medieval, but this simple strap gently held my jaw closed, allowing my nasal mask to do its job perfectly. No more leaks, no more dry mouth. It wasn’t a high-tech mask; it was a simple fix that finally made my CPAP work *with* my beard, not against it. Sometimes, the best solution is the one that just helps you keep your mouth shut.
