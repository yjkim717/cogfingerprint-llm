The crisp crunch of snow under my boots last January was a sound I’d been craving, but as I cinched the last strap on my Zpacks Sub-Nero, a familiar doubt crept in. Winter hiking demands more—more layers, more fuel, more safety gear. My beloved ultralight pack, perfect for three-season trips, suddenly felt like it was holding its breath, its minimal frame begging for just a little extra room.

Staring at that sleek, top-strap-less design, I didn't just see a piece of gear; I saw a metaphor. How often do we try to force our summer selves to handle life’s winters? We cling to routines and tools that worked in easier times, refusing to adapt. That tiny modification—adding a simple top strap—wasn't just about carrying a puffy jacket. It was a quiet admission that to enjoy the harsh, beautiful silence of a frozen trail, I needed to grant myself permission to change my loadout. Sometimes, the lightest move you can make is to acknowledge when you need to carry a little more.
