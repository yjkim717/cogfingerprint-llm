Looking back on my first semester at UC Davis in 2021, I remember how nervous I was about finding a roommate. I’d scroll through forums late at night, wondering if I’d find someone who’d get my weird mix of psych major curiosity and premed stress.

I ended up matched randomly—and it was the best thing that could’ve happened. My roommate, a laid-back environmental science major, taught me to step away from the textbooks. We’d explore the arboretum between Zoom lectures, and those walks became my reset button. Balancing organic chemistry with cognitive psychology wasn’t easy, but having a built-in friend made campus life feel less like a checklist and more like an adventure. It’s funny—sometimes the parts of college you don’t plan end up shaping you the most.
