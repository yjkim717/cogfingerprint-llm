"As I reflect on my 2021 food journey, I realize I've gravitated towards plant-based goodness. Fermenting has become a new passion, allowing me to savor seasonal veggies year-round. Vegetable-centred meals have taken centre stage, and I'm loving the creativity it brings to my cooking. It's been a year of experimentation and growth, and I'm excited to see where these trends take me in the kitchen."
