>## Trading Gears: A Mid-Life Shift

It’s funny how hobbies reflect life, isn't it? Lately, I've been obsessed with resurrecting an old mountain bike. A sturdy, slightly rusty thing from the 90s, it’s been gathering dust in the garage for far too long. But the itch to explore beyond paved roads has grown strong. I’m dreaming of gravel paths, quiet country lanes, and a whole new perspective on my local area.

The project? A conversion. Trading the familiar flat bars for drop bars, essentially transforming it into a makeshift gravel bike. It’s a surprisingly complex puzzle, mostly centered around the shifters. Getting the right components to work with the old drivetrain… well, it’s a rabbit hole I’m happily tumbling down. 

This isn't just about bikes, though. It feels symbolic. Like, aren't we all constantly recalibrating? Shedding old habits, embracing new challenges? Maybe this slightly eccentric bike project is my way of acknowledging that, of actively choosing to shift gears and explore a different kind of terrain. 2021 feels like a year ripe for reinvention, and I'm starting with two wheels.
