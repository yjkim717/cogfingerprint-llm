## The Echo in the Hallway: Finding My Own Rhythm After a Rough Start

Okay, so I’m writing this because… well, because sometimes it feels good to just *say* things, you know? To put them out there and not just let them swirl around in your head, feeding the anxiety. And honestly, the last few weeks have been… a lot.

It’s September 2021, and I’m starting my A-Levels at Crestwood Sixth Form. Not the usual experience, right? Most people were going back to their familiar schools, reconnecting with friends after a weird summer of fluctuating restrictions. Me? I was arriving as an external student, which, in Crestwood terms, basically means “the person who travels from another school.”

Crestwood’s got a reputation. Good one, academically. But also… a reputation for being a bit of a bubble. It’s this gorgeous, sprawling campus, all stone buildings and perfectly manicured lawns. It *looks* like the setting of a prestige drama. And in a way, I guess it felt like one. Except I wasn't one of the actors. I was more like… the stagehand, awkwardly trying to blend into the scenery.

The first day was… overwhelming. It wasn’t actively hostile, not at all. Just… distant. Everyone seemed to already *know* everyone. Little groups were clustered together, laughing, sharing inside jokes. I tried to smile, to look approachable, but it felt like I was smiling into a void.  I remember wandering around, desperately trying to find my history classroom, feeling increasingly lost and, if I’m honest, incredibly lonely.

It’s a strange feeling, being lonely in a room full of people. You’re surrounded by life, by conversation, but you’re still utterly isolated. It’s like being underwater, watching everyone else move freely while you’re trapped in a silent, muffled world.

The first week blurred into a series of awkward lunches spent scrolling through TikTok, trying to avoid eye contact. I’d see groups laughing, and a little voice in my head would whisper, "They're laughing *at* you." I know it's irrational. I *know* that's not what was happening. But the feeling was real. It was a constant hum of anxiety, a low-level dread that settled in my stomach every morning.

I think a big part of it was the clique thing. Crestwood definitely had its established social circles. There were the sporty ones, the drama kids, the debate team whizzes, and then… well, there was me. The external student who took the bus and seemed to be perpetually clutching a textbook.  I felt like I was being categorized, boxed in before I even had a chance to be *me*.

And let’s be real, 2021 was already a weird time.
