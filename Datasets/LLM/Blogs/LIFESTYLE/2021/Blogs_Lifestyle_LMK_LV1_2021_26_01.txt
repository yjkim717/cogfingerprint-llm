As I stepped out of the garage, the smell of burning rubber still lingered in the air. I had just watched a friend's racing car accelerate from a standstill, leaving a cloud of smoke behind. At first, I thought it was just a showy stunt, but then I realized that the smoke was actually decreasing as the car picked up speed. It made me think about how we tackle challenges in life. Like the static friction that gets overcome when we first start moving, our initial resistance to change can give way to momentum. As we gain speed, we shift from forced effort to a smoother, more kinetic pace.
