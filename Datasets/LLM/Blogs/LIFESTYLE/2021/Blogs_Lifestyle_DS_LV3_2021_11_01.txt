It was supposed to be simple. In 2021, my quest for a smarter home led me to the D5 robot vacuum. I followed the instructions to a T: a full factory reset, carefully typing my WiFi password into the Neato app. Yet, there it sat, stubbornly blinking, refusing to connect.

This tiny machine became a metaphor for my own life. How often had I tried to "reset" myself, meticulously planning new routines, only to hit a stubborn connection issue with my own motivation? Sometimes, the problem isn't the setup; it's the expectation of instant, seamless integration. True change, like a stable connection, requires more than just the right detailsâ€”it demands patience and a willingness to troubleshoot the unexpected glitches along the way.
