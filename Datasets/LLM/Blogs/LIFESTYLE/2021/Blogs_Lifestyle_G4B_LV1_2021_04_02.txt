**My Prayer Plant's Plea (and My Own Little Crisis)**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic and everything else, I was definitely operating on autopilot for a good chunk of the year.  I even let my plant care fall by the wayside. Specifically, my prayer plant, Silas. 

He started looking seriously unhappy – the leaves were curling up like he was trying to disappear, and he was just…droopy. It hit me hard – he was mirroring my own feeling of being overwhelmed and neglected.  I realized I’d been ignoring his needs, just like I’d been ignoring some of my own. 

So, I did a little research, realized he desperately needed more water and a warmer spot, and I even attempted propagation – splitting off a little baby Silas! It felt strangely symbolic, like a small act of nurturing myself.  Taking care of Silas forced me to slow down, be more present, and remember that even the smallest things deserve attention.  Maybe we’re both learning to breathe a little easier.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a different aspect of the summary?
