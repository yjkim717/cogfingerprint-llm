**The Fade Away**

Remember staring at a laser pointer, mesmerized by that tight, focused beam? Lately, I’ve been thinking about how those beams seem to disappear when two meet – like energy just… vanishes. It’s unsettling, right? It made me realize how much of our lives feels like that too – moments of intense focus, passion, then a gradual fading away.  Is it really lost, or just transformed? #reflection #energy #2021

**Note:** I’ve woven in the concepts of “collimated beam” (focused energy), “recombination” (beams canceling), and “thermodynamics” (energy loss) subtly through the metaphor of fading energy.  Let me know if you’d like me to tweak it or explore a specific aspect further!
