"Finding Freedom in the Cloud: My Journey to Remote Work"

As I sat in my home office in 2021, sipping coffee and staring at my AWS certification badges on the wall, I felt a deep sense of accomplishment and freedom. Just a year ago, I was stuck in a traditional network engineering role, longing for a change. I decided to take the leap and upskill in cloud engineering, driven by the promise of remote work and a better work-life balance. With dedication and persistence, I obtained my AWS certifications and transitioned into a cloud engineering role that allowed me to work from home. The flexibility has been a game-changer, enabling me to focus on my career development while pursuing my passion for network specialization. I'm now able to enjoy the best of both worlds â€“ a fulfilling career and a lifestyle that suits me.
