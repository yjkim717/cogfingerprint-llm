Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the kitten summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and approximately 135 words, set in 2021:

**Little Worries, Big Lessons**

It feels like 2021 was a year of little, persistent worries, didn’t it?  I was so focused on the big, looming anxieties of the world, I almost missed the tiny tremors of concern in my own life. Like when Leo, my ginger tabby, started showing a little swelling near his belly after his spay. 

Suddenly, a tiny lump appeared – it was enough to send me into a frantic vet consultation. Thankfully, it turned out to be nothing serious, just a minor inflammation needing antibiotics. It was a stark reminder that sometimes, the most important things are right in front of us, demanding our attention.  It’s easy to get lost in the noise, but slowing down to notice those small signals – whether it's a worried pet or a quiet feeling – can make all the difference.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
