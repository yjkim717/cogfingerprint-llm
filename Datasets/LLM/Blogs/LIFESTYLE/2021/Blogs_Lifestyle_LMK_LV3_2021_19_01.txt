Upgrading my PC felt like a refreshing reboot in 2021. Installing my new Intel LGA1700 CPU was a breeze, but mounting the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite Capellax Cooler had me stumped. After some trial and error, I finally got it right. The process taught me that even in tech, patience and persistence pay off. Now, my rig runs smoothly, and I'm ready to tackle the day with a cool and capable machine.
