You know what took me back to 2001? Seeing crimped hair on 90 Day Fiancé last night. It was Chuck’s family, stirring drama with those crunchy waves. Honestly, it made me smile—a weird comfort in chaotic times. Maybe we all need a little throwback flair and messy family moments to feel grounded again. Some things never change, and maybe that’s okay.
