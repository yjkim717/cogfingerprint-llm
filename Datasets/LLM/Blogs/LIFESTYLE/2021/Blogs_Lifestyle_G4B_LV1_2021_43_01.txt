**Colab & the Ghosts of My Code**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2021 felt like a year of frantically building things – little scripts, prototypes, just enough to feel like I was *doing* something. I leaned *hard* on Google Colab, especially for those late-night experiments. It was such a convenient, ephemeral dev environment – just spin up a Docker container, push some code, and forget about it.

But lately, I’ve been feeling a little uneasy. Like I was borrowing resources without really considering the impact. It felt… almost like a quiet form of abuse, using something so freely available without acknowledging the collective.  I’m trying to be more mindful now, recognizing that even these temporary spaces have a cost.  It’s a small shift, but one I think I need to make.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different style of post?
