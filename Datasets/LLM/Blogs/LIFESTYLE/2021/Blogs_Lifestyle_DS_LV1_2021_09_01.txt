Looking back at 2021, my kitchen became a bit of a science labâ€”in the best way. I dove headfirst into fermenting everything from cabbage to carrots, discovering that a jar of homemade kimchi could transform even the simplest rice bowl. I leaned into plant-based meals, letting vegetables truly shine, and found myself reaching for gochujang to add that perfect spicy, savory kick. It wasn't just about eating; it was about slowing down and savoring the process, one bubbly, flavorful jar at a time.
