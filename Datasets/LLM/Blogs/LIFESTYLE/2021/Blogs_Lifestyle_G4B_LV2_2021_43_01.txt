**The Ghost in the Machine (and Why I Felt a Little Guilty)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2021 felt like a year of chasing digital ghosts. I was deep in the weeds of a new project, using Google Colab to spin up these ridiculously quick, ephemeral development environments. It was *genius* – fast, free, and perfect for prototyping. 

But lately, I’ve been wrestling with a tiny little voice of guilt. Was I, in a way, abusing the system? Colab’s resources are shared, and I was basically demanding temporary access to a whole lot of computing power. It felt a bit like borrowing someone's tools without asking, even if it was temporary. 

It made me think about how easily we get caught up in the convenience of tech, forgetting the broader context.  Anyone else ever feel that phantom weight of responsibility when using freely available resources?
