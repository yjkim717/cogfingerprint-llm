It's a strange feeling, isn't it, when you know something isn't quite right, but navigating the medical system feels like wading through mud? That’s where my family and I find ourselves right now. My child has been struggling with gastroparesis – GP, as those in the know call it – and it’s been a frustrating uphill battle. Simple things, like eating a meal without discomfort, have become major challenges.

We're desperately seeking a specialist, someone truly familiar with GP and potentially connected to an autonomic clinic. Ideally, within a few hours' drive of western Tennessee. It feels isolating, searching for that right doctor, that understanding voice. There's a lot of information online about domperidone and its potential, but finding the right professional guidance feels paramount. Hoping to connect with others on this journey – any recommendations are deeply appreciated.
