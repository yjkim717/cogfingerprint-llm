Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 230 words, set in 2021:

**The Ghosts of Missed Meetings**

It’s funny how some things stick with you, aren’t they? Like the lingering scent of coffee after a morning you really needed to sleep in, or a half-finished thought you can’t quite grasp. For me, lately, it’s been the feeling of… letdown. Specifically, the feeling of disappointment connected to a group I’d been trying to build – the Saturday Shares in the r/stopdrinking subreddit.

This year, 2021, was a messy one. I was genuinely excited about creating a safe space online, a little pocket of support where people could share their struggles and victories without judgment. We called it "Saturday Shares," a simple way to build accountability and connection. But it kept falling apart. Cancellations piled up, people would sign up and then just… disappear. It felt like a constant stream of “no-shows.”

Honestly, it stung. It felt like a personal failure, like I wasn’t providing what people needed. I started questioning everything – was it too early? Too late? Was I just pushing something that wasn't wanted? 

Recently, I’ve been adjusting the system, listening to the feedback, and realizing that building a supportive community isn’t about rigid structure, it’s about genuine connection. Sometimes, people need a gentle nudge, sometimes they need to step away and regroup. It’s a reminder that growth, and recovery, is rarely a straight line.  And that's okay.
