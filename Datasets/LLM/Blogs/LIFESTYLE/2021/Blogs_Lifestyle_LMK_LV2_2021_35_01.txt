"As I sat surrounded by my growing media collection in 2021, I realized my home server was bursting at the seams. I turned to my trusty QNAP TS-453Be NAS and TR-004 expansion unit to create a robust RAID 5 setup. Configuring it for my PLEX server was a game-changer - seamless streaming to every device in the house. The process taught me that sometimes, embracing change (like a new NAS setup) can bring order and freedom to our digital lives, just like it did mine."
