## The Great House Number Escape of '21 (and My DIY Struggles)

Okay, friends, let's talk frustration. This year has been… a lot. And apparently, my house numbers decided to join the chaos. Seriously! We put up these cute, lightweight plaques with those siding clips, thinking we were being clever with a little DIY home improvement. Turns out, clever wasn't quite sturdy enough. They kept popping off in the wind! 

It’s become a running joke – me, scrambling to find the rogue numbers scattered across the lawn. Now I'm rethinking my whole hanging strategy, especially for some heavier decor I want on the garage. Anyone have brilliant ideas for securing things to siding? I'm open to anything that *doesn't* involve constant retrieval missions! Send help (and maybe some strong adhesive!).
