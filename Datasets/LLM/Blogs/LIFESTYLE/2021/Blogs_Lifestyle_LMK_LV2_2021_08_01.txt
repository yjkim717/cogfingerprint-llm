As we packed up our gear for our puppy's first camping trip to the deserts of New Mexico and Utah in the summer of 2021, my mind was racing with concerns. How would our little furball handle the scorching heat? We had been preparing him for outdoor adventures, but nothing could have prepared us for the dry, blistering desert sun. A friend suggested dog shoes to protect his paws from the hot sand and rocky terrain. At first, I was skeptical, but after some research, I realized it was a genius idea. As we hit the trails, I was amazed at how well our puppy adjusted. The dog shoes were a game-changer, and with plenty of water and breaks, he thrived. Our adventure was a success, and we learned that with the right preparation, our furry friends can join us on even the most rugged outdoor escapades.
