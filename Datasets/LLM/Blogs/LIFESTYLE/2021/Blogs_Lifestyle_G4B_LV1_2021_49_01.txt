**The Google Form Glitch**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of little frustrations piling up. I was relying on a simple Google Form for a volunteer signup – something *public*, meant for anyone to just pop on and apply. But then, bam! Google decided you needed to sign in to even *see* it. 

It’s such a small thing, but it felt like a tiny barrier erected, making it harder to share opportunities and get responses. It made me think about how even the simplest online tools can suddenly feel complicated, and how that impacts connection.  A little annoying, definitely!
