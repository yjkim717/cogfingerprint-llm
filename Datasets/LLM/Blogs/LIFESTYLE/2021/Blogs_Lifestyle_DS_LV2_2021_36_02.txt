It was supposed to be a simple financial wellness step: contributing to my Health Savings Account. I felt so responsible, diligently setting aside money in my HSA for 2019 and 2020.

Then, the IRS letter arrived in early 2021.

My heart sank. Turns out, my employer had made errors on my W-2—overfunding some years, missing deposits in others. A simple administrative mistake, but the fallout landed squarely in my lap. Suddenly, I was navigating the labyrinth of filing an amended return, a process that felt anything but “amended”; it was a full-blown life disruption.

It was a stark 2021 reminder that sometimes, despite our best efforts, we’re at the mercy of others' oversights. My quest for health security ironically became a major source of stress, teaching me a tough lesson in financial vigilance I won’t soon forget.
