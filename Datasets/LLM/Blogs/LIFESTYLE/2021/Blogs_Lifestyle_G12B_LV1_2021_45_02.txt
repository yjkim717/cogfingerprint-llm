>## The Spreadsheet & The Promise

It's 2021, and I'm finally facing a truth I've been dodging: our finances were… separate. Not in a bad way, exactly, but independently managed. We both worked, both paid our bills, and somehow, it *mostly* worked. But there was a lack of transparency, a subtle disconnect. 

Recently, we started talking about truly merging our lives, and that includes our money. The idea of a joint credit card felt a little scary, but the thought of being accountable to each other, seeing where our money *really* goes, felt… good. We’re even exploring the authorized user route initially, a gentler introduction to shared spending. 

It’s more than just budgeting apps and spreadsheets, though. It’s about trust, about financial honesty being a core piece of our partnership. It's a little daunting, but also exciting - a step towards building something truly interwoven. Wish us luck!
