>## The Unexpected Quest for a Good Night's Sleep (and a Manageable Beard)

Okay, real talk. For years, I’ve battled a nightly struggle I didn’t fully understand. I'd wake up exhausted, mouth dry as the Sahara, and with a killer morning headache. Turns out, I’m a mouth breather, a fact confirmed by a recent sleep study and the subsequent diagnosis of mild sleep apnea. Cue the CPAP machine!

Now, enter the next hurdle: my beard. I’ve cultivated a pretty respectable one over the years, and the thought of shaving it off wasn't exactly appealing. Finding a CPAP mask that seals properly with facial hair is proving to be a surprisingly complex quest. 

I've been researching like crazy – AirFit N30, nasal pillows, full face masks… the options are overwhelming! It’s highlighted how much we take a good night's sleep for granted. I'm also trying to improve my sleep hygiene - ditching the late-night scrolling and aiming for a more consistent bedtime. It’s a work in progress, but hopefully, soon I'll be sleeping soundly *and* rocking my beard. Any CPAP mask recommendations from fellow bearded mouth breathers? Let me know!
