## Is There More to Pressure Advance Than We Think? (A Voron 2.4 Reflection)

Okay, fellow makers, let's talk Klipper and pushing the boundaries. I've been deep in tuning my Voron 2.4, and something's been nagging at me regarding Pressure Advance. The recommended low-speed tuning (100mm/s) feels… limiting. 

We're all chasing those faster print speeds – 250mm/s, 350mm/s, and beyond – and I can't help but wonder if dialing in Pressure Advance at a snail's pace truly prepares us for those higher velocities. It feels a bit like training for a marathon by only walking. 

Maybe it's time we rethink the approach, experiment a little, and see if we can unlock even more potential from our machines. Anyone else feeling this? Let's share our experiences!
