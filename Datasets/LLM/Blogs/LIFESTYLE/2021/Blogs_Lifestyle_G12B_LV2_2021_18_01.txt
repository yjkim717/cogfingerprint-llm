Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and a 2021 context. I've focused on weaving in the themes of regret, self-worth, parental guilt, and past failures, while keeping the language conversational.  I've also included a suggested title.  Let me know what you think, and if you'd like any adjustments!

**Title: The Weight of "What If?" and Finding Peace in the Now**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How the past just *lingers*. I’m sitting here in my living room, laundry piled high (a very 2021 reality, let's be honest), watching my kids build a fort out of blankets and pillows, and a wave of… something washes over me. It’s not sadness, exactly. It’s more like a dull ache, a constant hum of “what if?”

I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately. Probably too much. It started with a conversation with a friend, a casual mention of a career path not taken, a relationship that fizzled out before it really began. And suddenly, the floodgates opened. I found myself replaying moments from my twenties and early thirties, picking them apart, assigning blame, and generally torturing myself with the ghosts of decisions made (and not made).

There was the time I didn't apply for that internship. The project I abandoned out of fear of failure. The words I left unsaid. Each one feels like a tiny crack in the foundation of who I thought I was supposed to be. And the guilt? Oh, the parental guilt. Wondering if I’m *enough* for my kids, if the baggage I carry is somehow impacting them. Are they seeing a mom who's confident and grounded, or a woman still wrestling with the echoes of her past?

2020 and 2021 have been… a lot. The pandemic forced a stillness on the world, and for me, that stillness amplified the internal noise. It’s been a year of confronting things I’d been skillfully avoiding. Therapy has been a lifeline, honestly, helping me unpack some of these deeply ingrained beliefs about my worth.

I’m learning – slowly, painstakingly – that dwelling on “what ifs” is a thief of joy. It steals the present, the beautiful, messy, imperfect reality of right now. My kids are laughing, the sun is streaming through the window, and I’m here. That’s a lot.

It’s not about erasing the past; it’s about acknowledging it, learning from it, and then… letting it go. It’s about accepting that I’m human, that I’ve made mistakes, and that those mistakes don’t define me. They're just… part of the story. And right now, I’m choosing to focus on writing the next chapter. A chapter filled with grace, forgiveness (especially for myself), and a whole lot of blanket forts.
