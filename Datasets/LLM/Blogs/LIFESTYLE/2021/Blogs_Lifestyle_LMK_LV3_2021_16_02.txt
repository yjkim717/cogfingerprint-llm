As a guitar enthusiast, I've often wondered if a pricier instrument truly sounds better. My $150 starter guitar got me started, but is upgrading to a high-end model worth the hefty price tag? For me, it's not just about the sound quality, but the joy of playing. While a more expensive guitar may offer improved efficiency and craftsmanship, the true value lies in the music it helps create, not just its price.
