It’s 2021, and I’ve noticed our local subreddit’s vibe shifting. Lately, it feels like every other post is just another photo—beautiful, sure, but it’s starting to drown out real discussions. I’ve reluctantly started downvoting them; it’s not personal, but it’s beginning to feel like spam, not community.
