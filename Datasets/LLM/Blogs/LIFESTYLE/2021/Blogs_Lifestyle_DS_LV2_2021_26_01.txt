That first week of working from home in 2021, I was all tire smoke. A frantic spin of video calls, trying to prove I was still "in gear." It was a performance, burning out before I even got moving.

Then I learned the racing secret: the real power isn't in the dramatic spin. It's in the quiet, firm grip before you go. It’s the static friction of a deep breath before a new task, the calm connection to the road ahead. That’s where true, sustainable acceleration begins. No burnout required.
