>## The Weight of Digital Dust

It’s funny, isn't it? How something intangible can feel so…heavy. I spent months meticulously collecting crafting materials in Apex Legends – little bits of digital dust, really – aiming for that perfect skin. Then, poof, gone. Lost. And the EA support response? Utterly unhelpful. 

It got me thinking about all the things we invest time and energy into that can vanish. Hobbies, relationships, even just a feeling of accomplishment. It's a hard pill to swallow, this impermanence. Makes you appreciate the tangible things, the sun on your face, a good cup of coffee. Maybe chasing digital skins isn’t the best use of 2021 after all.
