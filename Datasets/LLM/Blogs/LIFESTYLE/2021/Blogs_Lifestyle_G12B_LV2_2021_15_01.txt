## The Echo in the Empty Spaces

It's funny, isn't it? How a feeling can just… settle in. Like a persistent fog, clinging to everything, muting the colours, dampening the sound. That’s how it felt for me, those first few weeks of September 2021.

I’d started as an external student at a new sixth form, a decision I’d been excited about for months. A chance for a fresh start, new subjects, and a different environment. I’d envisioned bustling hallways, engaging conversations, and quickly finding my niche. The reality, however, was a lot quieter, a lot lonelier, and a lot more…echoing.

The first day was a blur of unfamiliar faces and confusing map-reading. I managed a few polite smiles, a mumbled "hi" here and there, but nothing that felt like a genuine connection. Everyone seemed to already *know* everyone. They had established groups, inside jokes, a shared history I hadn’t been a part of. I felt like I was watching a play, desperately trying to figure out the script, while everyone else had already memorized their lines.

It's not that people were *mean*. Not at all. It was more that I was… invisible. Or, worse, a fleeting curiosity that quickly faded. The lunchroom felt like a vast, echoing space, filled with the clatter of cutlery and the murmur of conversations I wasn't privy to. I'd gravitate towards corners, pretending to be engrossed in a book, while really just trying to disappear.

I know, it sounds dramatic. And logically, I knew it was probably just the initial awkwardness of a new environment. But logic doesn't always soothe the soul, does it? That feeling of being on the outside looking in, of not quite belonging, is a uniquely potent kind of ache.

It wasn't just the school environment either. 2021 had been… a year. The pandemic still loomed large, social interactions were still often mediated through screens, and the general atmosphere felt tentative, uncertain. Even outside of school, connecting with people felt harder. That sense of isolation, that echo in the empty spaces, seemed to be amplified for everyone.

I started to overthink *everything*. Did I say the wrong thing? Was I too quiet? Too awkward? The social anxiety, which had always been a low hum in the background, cranked itself up to a full-blown chorus. It felt exhausting.

Then, one rainy afternoon, I stumbled upon the photography club. It was a small group, huddled around a table, sharing photos and swapping tips. I almost didn’t go in. The familiar wave of self-doubt whispered that I wouldn’t fit in, that I'd just be a clumsy outsider. But something – maybe desperation, maybe a tiny spark of hope – pushed me through the door.

And you know what? It wasn't as
