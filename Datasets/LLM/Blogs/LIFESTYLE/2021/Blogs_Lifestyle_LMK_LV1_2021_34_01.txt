As I hung my latest 3D printed creation on the wall, I pondered the best way to attach the thin PLA plaque to its wooden backer. In 2021, with all the adhesive options available, I was spoiled for choice. I considered using a strong 2-part epoxy or a flexible construction adhesive. Mechanical attachments were also on the table. Ultimately, I opted for a hybrid approach, combining a dab of adhesive with a discreet screw. The result was a sturdy, long-lasting display that showcased my art. Sometimes, a little experimentation is the key to finding the perfect solution.
