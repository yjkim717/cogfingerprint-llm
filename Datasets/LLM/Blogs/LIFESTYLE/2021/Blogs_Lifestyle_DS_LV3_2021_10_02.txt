It’s Saturday again, and I’m reflecting on my journey—one I never thought I’d be on. Back in 2021, amid the chaos, I found this corner of the internet: r/stopdrinking. You, my fellow Sobernauts, became my anchor. Sharing our stories, our sobering thoughts, has been a lifeline. Every "IWNDWYT" is a promise to ourselves and each other. Let’s keep lifting one another up—your courage fuels mine. What’s your story this Saturday?
