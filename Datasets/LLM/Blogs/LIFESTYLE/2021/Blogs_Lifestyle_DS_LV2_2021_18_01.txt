Of course. Here is a reflective blog post written from the perspective of the father.

### The Ghost in the Room Full of Joy

There’s a ghost in my house. It doesn’t rattle chains or drift through walls. It’s the ghost of a man I used to be—the one from 2018, clutching a severance package and a bottomless pit of fear.

Today, my life is full of the sounds that ghost would have killed for. My daughter’s laughter as she chases the dog through the kitchen. The steady hum of my laptop, proof of a job I’ve held for two years. The easy, comfortable silence with my wife as we clean up after dinner.

Yet, sometimes, in the middle of all that joy, he taps me on the shoulder.

He whispers when I’m paying the mortgage, reminding me of the months we nearly didn’t make it. He flickers in my peripheral vision during a performance review, a phantom of the professional failures I can’t seem to forget. He’s the reason a small, offhand comment from my wife about finances can send me into a tailspin, building a wall between us that she doesn’t understand.

It’s the ultimate paradox of 2021. On paper, I’ve never been more stable. In my heart, the old wounds can still feel fresh.

I’m learning that healing isn’t a straight line. It’s not about “getting over it.” It’s about acknowledging the ghost, thanking him for the lessons in resilience he taught me, and then gently asking him to step aside. He doesn’t get to dim the light of my daughter’s smile. He doesn’t get to drown out the sound of my wife’s laugh.

My past is a part of my story, but it doesn’t get to write the ending. Today, I’m choosing to close the laptop, get down on the floor, and build a Lego tower. The ghost can wait.
