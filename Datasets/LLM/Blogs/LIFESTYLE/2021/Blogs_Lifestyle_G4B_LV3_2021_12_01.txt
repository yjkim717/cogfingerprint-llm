**The Unexpected Battle with My CPAP**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 was a year of unexpected challenges. I finally got a CPAP machine, a huge relief after years of restless nights. But somewhere between the mask and the sleep, I started battling a strange new foe: mouth breathing. And, honestly, it was growing a beard! 

It sounds ridiculous, I know. But waking up with a damp, puffy face and a surprisingly bushy mustache was seriously messing with my CPAP fit. The mask just wouldn’t seal properly, and I was left with a perpetually dry mouth and a sleep that felt…fragmented. 

It made me realize how much our habits – even seemingly small ones – can impact our sleep quality. I started focusing on nasal strips, a humidifier, and even just being more mindful of breathing throughout the day. It’s a weird, personal quest, but finding that comfortable seal and a genuinely restful sleep feels like a small victory.  Has anyone else experienced something similar with their CPAP journey?
