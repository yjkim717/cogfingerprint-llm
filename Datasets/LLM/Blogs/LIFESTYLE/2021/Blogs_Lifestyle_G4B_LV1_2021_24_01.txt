**The Frustration of Shiny Things**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we get so fixated on the *idea* of something, especially when it involves a little bit of tech wizardry. Late 2021, I was completely obsessed with automating everything. I’d just started diving into PowerShell – seriously, who *doesn’t* want to control their computer with commands? – and I decided I was going to build a script to scrape Nationwide branch locations from their website. 

Sounds simple, right? Turns out, websites are surprisingly clever about hiding their inner workings. My script kept hitting dead ends, wrestling with ‘directory-listlink’ and struggling to find the right ‘href’ tags. It was incredibly frustrating, a tiny digital wall I couldn’t seem to scale. 

It made me realize that sometimes, the most satisfying things aren’t the ones we *build* perfectly, but the ones we learn from the process of trying.  And maybe, just maybe, a good old-fashioned map and a phone call are still perfectly adequate.
