"Commuter Life: A Lesson Learned Too Late. As I navigated college life in 2021, I often wondered what it'd be like to be a dormer. Now, I regret not experiencing campus social life firsthand.

If I could redo my college years, I'd dorm in a heartbeat to be part of the vibrant campus community and make the most of my college experience."
