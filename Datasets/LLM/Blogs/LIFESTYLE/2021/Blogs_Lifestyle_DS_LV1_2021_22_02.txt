Even though I don’t understand a word of Japanese, the band Tricot’s music hits me right in the heart. In 2021, stuck in my apartment, their songs became my daily escape. I’d listen to “Pool” or “Afureru,” feeling the emotion in the singer’s voice, and wonder—what stories was she telling? It made me realize that connection isn’t always about words. Sometimes, the pure feeling in a melody can cross any language barrier and make you feel a little less alone.
