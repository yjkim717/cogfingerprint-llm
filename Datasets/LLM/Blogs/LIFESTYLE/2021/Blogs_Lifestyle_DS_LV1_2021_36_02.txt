**The Year I Learned to Let Go of Perfect**

2021 was supposed to be the year I got my life perfectly in order. I was color-coding my calendar and tracking every penny. So, when a letter from the IRS arrived, my heart sank. My employer had accidentally overfunded my Health Savings Account (HSA) for two years, and now I was facing penalties on my amended return.

My first instinct was pure panic. I’d been so careful! But after a deep breath, I realized this was a lesson in disguise. I couldn’t control every detail, not even the ones on my W-2. Life, like taxes, is sometimes messy through no fault of our own.

Navigating the fix was stressful, but it taught me to focus on solutions, not perfection. Sometimes, the most organized thing you can do is learn to gracefully handle the disarray.
