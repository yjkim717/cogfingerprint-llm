## Little Rituals, Big Questions

It's 2021, and I'm still figuring things out. Lately, I've been experimenting – a little Rogaine here, a dab of castor oil there – trying to nudge my body in a direction that feels more *me*, without jumping straight to testosterone. It’s weird, this body navigation. These little rituals, these oils and foams, they're a quiet act of agency, a tentative exploration of what growth can look like on my own terms.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
