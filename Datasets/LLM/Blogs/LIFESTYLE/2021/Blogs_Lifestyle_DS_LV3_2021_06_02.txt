There I was, capturing the perfect sunset with my new Pixel 6 Pro—the colors were breathtaking. But then came the wait. That spinning circle felt eternal, especially as dusk turned to night. It got me thinking: in our fast-paced 2021 lives, are we missing the beauty in these forced pauses? Maybe the camera’s processing time is a gentle nudge to just breathe and appreciate the moment before the final shot appears.
