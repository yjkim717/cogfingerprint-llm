Remember that sunset last summer? While everyone held up phones, I paused to just breathe it in. Now, those perfect videos sit forgotten in our cameras, but the warmth of that golden light and the sound of laughter? I can still feel it. In 2021, we’re so focused on capturing the moment, we forget to live it. Put the phone down sometimes—your most cherished memories deserve to be felt, not just filed away.
