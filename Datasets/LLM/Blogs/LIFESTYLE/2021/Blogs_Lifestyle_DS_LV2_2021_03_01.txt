The trail has always been my therapist, but this time it feels different. As I piece together my ultralight kit for a solo CDT attempt—counting every ounce of my sul gear, wrestling with the bear canister debate—I realize I’m packing more than supplies. I’m packing hope.

In 2021, the world felt heavy with uncertainty, but out here, every choice is mine. This hike isn’t just about miles; it’s my next chapter in recovery, a quiet rebellion against the chaos I once called normal. I’m leaving room for growth, not just granola.

To those who’ve walked this path before: any wisdom for a soul learning to carry less, and live more?
