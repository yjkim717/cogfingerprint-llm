"As I worked on my latest DIY project in 2021, I found myself stuck on a seemingly simple problem: how to securely attach a thin 3D-printed PLA plaque to a wooden backer. I was determined to find a solution that didn't involve traditional mechanical fastening. After some trial and error, I discovered that using adhesive alternatives was the way to go. Not only did it provide a clean finish, but it also opened up new possibilities for my crafting endeavors. Sometimes, it's the smallest challenges that lead to the most innovative solutions."
