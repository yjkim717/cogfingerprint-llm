>## The Effort We Put In (Or Don't)

Okay, I've been on a *serious* binge of *90 Day Fiancé* lately, and it's got me thinking about…effort. Not just in relationships, but in *everything*. Watching Libby and Chuck navigate their family drama (and, let's be honest, Libby's consistently crimped hair) really highlighted this.

It's easy to complain about things, to let tension simmer. But are we *really* putting in the work to mend fences, to present our best selves? It’s 2021, and I think we all deserve to feel like we're actively contributing to a more positive and polished reality, even if it’s just smoothing down the metaphorical (or literal!) frizz. Food for thought, right?
