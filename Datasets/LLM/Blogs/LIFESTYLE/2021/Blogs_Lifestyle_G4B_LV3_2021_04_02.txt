**The Prayer Plant’s Plea – and My Own**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single, drooping plant can suddenly reflect our own anxieties. I’ve been nursing a prayer plant back to health this fall, and honestly, it’s become a surprisingly poignant project. It started with yellowing leaves, a desperate plea for more water, and then a whole lot of panicked internet searches – cuttings, leaf removal, the works. 

There’s something deeply comforting in trying to *fix* something failing, mirroring the way we often approach our own stresses. Just like the plant needs consistent care, we need to actively cultivate moments of rest and attention.  This little plant taught me that sometimes, the most vital care we can offer ourselves is simply a little bit of patience and a willingness to try and rescue what’s fading. 2021 felt like a year of constant rescue missions – for plants, and for myself.
