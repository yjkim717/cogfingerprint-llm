"As I marked another milestone in my sobriety journey in 2021, I felt a deep sense of connection with fellow Sobernauts on the r/stopdrinking subreddit. The Saturday Share invitation resonated with me, and I began sharing my story. It wasn't just about quitting drinking; it was about embracing a new lifestyle. Through this community, I found support and reflection, and discovered that my journey was just one of many, inspiring a ripple effect of positive change."
