## That Feeling When You Realize Things Aren't *Quite* What They Seemed...

Isn't it wild how sometimes you just...re-evaluate things? I was cleaning out my closet last week, a task I usually avoid like the plague, and stumbled across a box of old photos. Suddenly, memories flooded back – friendships, relationships, even that questionable haircut I rocked in college.

It made me think about how much we filter our experiences, how we tell ourselves stories to make sense of the past. And how sometimes, looking back, you see subtle clues you missed entirely. A forced laugh, a slightly uncomfortable silence… little things that now paint a different picture. It's a little unsettling, but also kind of freeing. It's a reminder that growth is about constantly adjusting your perspective, isn't it? Anyone else ever had a moment like that?
