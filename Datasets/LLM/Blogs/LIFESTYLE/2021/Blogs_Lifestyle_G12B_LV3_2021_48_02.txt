raveled in empathy, I recently found myself navigating the surprisingly complex world of airline upgrades for a loved one. My elderly relative was flying internationally with United, and the flight looked practically empty. Simple, right? Not so much. Online, the options were limited, leading to a bit of frustration. It highlighted how technology, while convenient, can sometimes create barriers, especially when assisting those less familiar with it. A phone call felt like the right move, a reminder that human connection still matters.
