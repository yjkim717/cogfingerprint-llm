As I tinkered with my FDM printer in 2021, I stumbled upon an intriguing idea - printing with metals like pewter. With a relatively low melting point, pewter seemed like a great candidate for metal FDM. I was fascinated by its potential and the printer's thermal conductivity. Experimenting with pewter opened up new creative avenues, merging technology with traditional crafting. It was a refreshing fusion that redefined my hobby and broadened my horizons.
