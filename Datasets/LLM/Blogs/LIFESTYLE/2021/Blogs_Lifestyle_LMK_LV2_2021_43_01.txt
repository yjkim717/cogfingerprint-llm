As I sat in my cozy home office in 2021, surrounded by screens and cables, I began to wonder: can Google Colab be a secret weapon for developers on-the-go? I've been using it to spin up ephemeral dev environments, and it's been a game-changer. But, a nagging thought crept in - am I abusing the system? Is using Colab for dev work fair to others, or is it a misuse of Google's generous resources?

As I pondered this, I realized that my coding lifestyle is all about balance. Just as I strive to balance work and personal life, I need to be mindful of how I use tools like Colab. I'm not alone in this conundrum - many developers are exploring cloud-based solutions to streamline their workflow. So, I'm turning the question to you: is using Google Colab for ephemeral dev environments a fair usage, or should we be looking for alternative solutions? Let's start a conversation.
