As I built my new rig in 2021, I realized that upgrading to the Intel LGA1700 socket meant rethinking my CPU cooler. With the Corsair iCUE H100i AIO, I was unsure if it was compatible out of the box. After some research, I discovered the need for a specific mounting kit to secure it properly. It was a great learning experience, and now my 12700k runs smoothly - a great start to my tech-savvy lifestyle.
