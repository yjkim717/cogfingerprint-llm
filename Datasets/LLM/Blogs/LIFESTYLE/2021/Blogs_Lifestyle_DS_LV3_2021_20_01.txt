It’s 2021, and I think we’re all still learning how to grieve and honor people from a distance. Last week, I stumbled upon something that felt like a quiet, beautiful answer: a ten-hour virtual benefit concert, streamed live with world-class orchestras.

It was in memory of a young violinist named Andriko Bilaniuk, a student at Bishop O’Connell High School whose life was cut short. Instead of just mourning, his community channeled that love into action—raising funds to endow a permanent music scholarship in his name.

As the melodies flowed through my small apartment, I was struck by the power of what we can build, even when we feel worlds apart. Classical music, often seen as formal and distant, became this intimate bridge connecting strangers for a cause bigger than any one of us. It wasn’t just about preserving music education; it was about keeping a spirit alive.

In a year still shadowed by loss, this concert reminded me that legacy isn’t always a grand statue. Sometimes, it’s a single note, passed on to the next student who dreams with a violin in their hands.
