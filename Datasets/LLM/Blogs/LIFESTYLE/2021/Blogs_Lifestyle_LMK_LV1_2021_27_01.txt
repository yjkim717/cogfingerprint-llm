"Rewatching HIMYM in 2021, I'm struck by how much I still love the show, but also by its dated humor. Barney's character, in particular, makes me cringe with his sexist antics. It's clear the showrunners relied on sexist jokes to get laughs, which feels out of touch today. As someone who's grown up watching the show, it's jarring to see how much societal attitudes have shifted - and how HIMYM hasn't aged as gracefully as I once thought."
