As I watched my 3D prints whizz by at breakneck speeds, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between high-speed printing and my own fast-paced lifestyle in 2021. Just like my Voron 2.4 printer, I often find myself juggling multiple tasks at once, racing against the clock to get everything done. But is it sustainable? I recently tweaked my Klipper settings, questioning whether to push for high speeds (3-400mm/s) or stick to the recommended 100mm/s for Pressure Advance Tuning. It made me ponder: are we sacrificing quality for the sake of speed? In life, just as in 3D printing, finding that perfect balance is key. Sometimes, slowing down can lead to better results and a more enjoyable journey. As I dialed back my print speeds, I realized that maybe it's time to do the same in life â€“ prioritize quality over quantity and savor the moment.
