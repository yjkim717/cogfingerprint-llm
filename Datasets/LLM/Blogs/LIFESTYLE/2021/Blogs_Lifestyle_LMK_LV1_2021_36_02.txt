"Health Savings Account (HSA) Headaches: A Cautionary Tale. In 2021, I thought I was doing everything right by contributing to my HSA through my employer. Little did I know, they were reporting incorrect contributions to the IRS. Fast forward to tax season, and I was hit with a surprise: my W2 showed a discrepancy in my HSA contributions, causing a big headache. It turned out my employer had overfunded my HSA, and I was left dealing with the IRS to resolve the issue. I was frustrated, but also relieved that it wasn't due to my own mistake. If you're contributing to an HSA through your employer, make sure to double-check your statements and W2 to avoid a similar headache. Trust me, it's worth the extra effort to ensure your HSA contributions are accurate and compliant with IRS regulations. A simple check could save you a world of stress down the line."
