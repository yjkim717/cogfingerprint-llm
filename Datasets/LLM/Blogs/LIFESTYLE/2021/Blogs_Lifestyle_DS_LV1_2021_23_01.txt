There’s something about that perfect skate-punk track—the frantic guitar, the driving beat—that just clicks. In 2021, stuck in a loop of remote work, I’d blast those songs and feel instantly untethered. It wasn't about reliving teen years, but reclaiming a bit of that reckless, forward-moving energy. Sometimes, the right music isn't just a soundtrack; it's a reminder to keep rolling, no matter what.
