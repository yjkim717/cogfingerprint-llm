"My robot vacuum woes in 2021. After a factory reset, I was stumped trying to sync my Neato D5 with the Neato app. The wifi connection was a breeze, but the app just wouldn't recognize my robot. I was determined to get it working, not just for convenience, but for the sake of my sanity. Hours of troubleshooting later, I finally found the solution. Has anyone else had a similar issue? It made me realize how reliant we've become on our smart devices - and how frustrating it can be when they don't work as promised!"
