## The Cloud & My Scattered Thoughts (and Code)

Okay, so I've been down a rabbit hole lately. A coding rabbit hole, specifically. I’ve been using Google Colab – you know, that free cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment – not just for running machine learning models, but as a… well, a *workspace*. Like Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces, but free. 

It’s incredibly convenient. I can hop on, work on a little side project, and just… leave it. No messy local setup, no worrying about dependencies. It’s ephemeral – it vanishes when I’m done. But it’s also made me think about something bigger. 

Are we, as developers, maybe leaning a little *too* heavily on these free cloud resources? Is it bordering on resource abuse? It's a guilt I hadn't anticipated. 

It mirrors a feeling I have about so much in life, really. We’re surrounded by easy, disposable options – fleeting connections, endless streaming content. It’s comfortable, but is it sustainable? I guess I’m just trying to find a balance between leveraging these amazing tools and being mindful of the bigger picture.
