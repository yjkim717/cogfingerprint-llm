It was supposed to be a simple procedure. In the fall of 2021, we brought our new kitten home after her spay surgery, armed with a course of antibiotics and instructions for a quiet recovery. For a few days, everything seemed fine. Then I felt it—a hard, unexpected lump near the incision site. My heart sank.

Despite the medication, the swelling persisted. Each time I checked, that small, firm bump was a stark reminder that things weren't going as planned. The waiting game for the vet's callback felt endless, every minute stretching into an hour filled with "what ifs." It’s in these quiet, anxious moments you realize how deeply you’re connected to these little lives. You just want a straightforward path to healing, but sometimes, the journey has unexpected bumps—both literal and figurative.
