## The Unexpected Freedom of Letting Go (and Meow Wolf!)

Okay, so I did something a little scary last Monday. We were in Santa Fe, and my partner really wanted to experience Meow Wolf – which, let’s be honest, is a *must*. But bringing our goofy golden retriever, Finn, felt like a hassle. After a lot of internal debate (guilt is real, people!), I booked a local dog sitter. 

It was just a few hours, but that little pocket of time felt… liberating. Walking into that immersive art world without the responsibility of a furry companion was surprisingly freeing. It allowed me to truly *be* present. It's a reminder that sometimes, letting go – even temporarily – can unlock unexpected joy and a little bit of self-care. 2021 has been about finding those small moments, hasn't it?
