As I watched the car racing event in 2021, I was fascinated by the smoke emanating from the tires at the starting line. It got me thinking - just like the wheels overcoming static friction, we often need to break free from our own inertia to get moving. As the cars accelerated, the smoke reduced, and they picked up speed. Similarly, when we push past our comfort zones and gain momentum in our lives, we become more focused and driven. It's a reminder that sometimes, we need to overcome our own 'static friction' to achieve our goals and reach our full potential.
