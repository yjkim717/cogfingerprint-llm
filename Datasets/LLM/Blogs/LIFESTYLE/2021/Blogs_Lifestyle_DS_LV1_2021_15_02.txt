Of all the things I expected to feel after my knee surgery in the2021, FOMO wasn't on the list. Yet, there I was, propped up on my sofa with my new best friends—a pair of unforgiving metal crutches—scrolling through my phone and feeling a genuine pang of it.

The surgery itself was a blur of pre-op nerves and the kind, detached efficiency of the NHS staff. Everything had gone to plan. By the afternoon, I was lucid enough, if a little wobbly, and fiercely independent streak kicked in. The physio had shown me how to navigate the world on crutches, and I was determined to conquer it. My partner was on his way, but I convinced the nurses I was ready. I signed the discharge papers, a triumphant, if pained, smile on my face. Freedom!

We made it home, I was installed in my designated recovery spot, and I finally checked my messages. A friend, who knew I’d been at the Freeman Hospital, had texted: “NO WAY! Warwick Davis was just there filming something for a charity! Did you see him?!”

My heart did a little lurch that had nothing to do with the anaesthesia. Warwick Davis! A genuine, beloved icon of my childhood, from *Willow* to *Harry Potter*. He was right there. In my hospital. While I was there.

And I missed him.

In my rush to reclaim my autonomy, to tick the "discharge" box and get back to my own four walls, I had literally crutched my way past a potential moment of pure, unexpected joy. I was so focused on the destination—getting home—that I completely overlooked the potential magic in the journey, or in this case, the hospital corridor.

It got me thinking, a dangerous pastime when you’re on strong painkillers. How often do we do this in life? We’re so fixated on the end goal—finishing the project, getting through the to-do list, reaching the weekend—that we bulldoze through the present. We miss the small, serendipitous moments that can’t be scheduled or planned. The chat with a stranger, the unexpected compliment, the sight of a perfect sunset… or the chance encounter with a legendary actor in a Newcastle hospital.

My knee is healing well now. The crutches are gathering dust in the cupboard. But the lesson from that day has stuck with me far more than any physio exercise. Life’s most delightful moments are often the unscripted ones, the happy accidents that happen when we’re not in a frantic rush to be somewhere else. I’m trying to be less focused on the discharge papers of life, and more open to the Warwick Davis moments. You never know what magic you might be hurrying past.
