**The Quiet Echo in My Soul**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How you can be *doing* everything right, and still feel…nothing. That’s how 2021 felt for a long time. I turned 31, and I was actively trying to build a better life. A career change was simmering – I’d finally taken the leap and started a freelance writing business. I was meeting new people, trying new hobbies, generally pushing myself to find some kind of meaning. 

Yet, underneath it all, there was this persistent, quiet echo – a deep feeling of emptiness. It wasn’t a dramatic, screaming kind of sadness, more like a dull ache, a sense of being utterly listless.  I’d catch glimpses of the ‘shoulds’ – the pressure to be happy, successful, *interesting* – and they’d just amplify the feeling of being…hollow.

I realized I was so focused on *doing* things to *feel* better, that I wasn't actually checking in with myself.  It’s easy to get caught up in the external, chasing achievements, when the real work is happening within.  

It’s a journey, definitely.  But acknowledging that quiet echo, that feeling of emptiness, felt like the first step toward actually listening to what my soul was trying to tell me.  Has anyone else experienced this – the paradox of progress and persistent feeling lost?
