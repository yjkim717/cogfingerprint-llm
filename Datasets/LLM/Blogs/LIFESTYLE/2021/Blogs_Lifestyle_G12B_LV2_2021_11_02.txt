## The View From My (New) Window

It’s funny how quickly things can change, isn’t it? Just last year, I was battling rush hour traffic, dreaming of a quieter life. Now, my commute is a ten-second walk from my bedroom to my home office. I’m a network engineer, and thanks to a push to embrace remote work and a whole lot of studying, I’m diving headfirst into the world of AWS certifications – specifically, aiming for that Network Specialist badge. 

Honestly, it's been a journey. Juggling studying for the SAA-C02 and the specialist cert with, you know, *life*, has been challenging. But the freedom? The ability to actually *see* daylight during lunch? It’s worth every late night spent pouring over documentation.

This year, 2021, feels like a turning point. A chance to build a career *and* a life that feels genuinely sustainable. I'm hoping my experience can help others considering a similar shift. Stay tuned – I'll be sharing more about my certification journey soon!
