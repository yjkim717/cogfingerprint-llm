As I juggled my creative pursuits with work in 2021, I found myself constantly switching between my Linux Mint machine and Windows for specific tasks. I realized that a seamless dual-booting experience required a high-performance filesystem that could handle my document and media storage needs across both operating systems. After some research, I discovered that using a compatible filesystem like exFAT or NTFS for my NVMe storage was the way to go. It not only boosted my productivity but also gave me the flexibility to work freely across platforms.
