As I hung my latest 3D printed art piece on the wall, I couldn't help but think about the challenge of attaching it to a wooden backer. It's funny how something so seemingly simple can be a hurdle. In 2021, with all the advancements in tech, you'd think it'd be a no-brainer. But, as I experimented with different methods, I realized it's not just about the attachment - it's about showcasing the art. I finally settled on a mechanical attachment that highlighted the plaque's details. Now, it proudly adorns my living room wall.
