Remember those early 2021 days, trying to find a new rhythm at home? I was determined to master my Boss Katana amp, a lockdown project. But my foot switch was stuckâ€”only flipping between banks, never landing on channel 2. It felt like life then: going through the motions but missing the right setting. Finally switching it to latch mode, that click was a small victory, a reminder that sometimes the fix isn't force, but finding the right mode.
