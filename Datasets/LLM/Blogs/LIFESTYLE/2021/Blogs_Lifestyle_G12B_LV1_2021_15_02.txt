## The Near Miss and the Weight of "What If"

It’s funny, isn’t it, how life throws these tiny, almost insignificant moments at you, and they linger longer than you’d expect? I’ve been thinking a lot about one such moment this week, and it’s got me pondering the whole business of timing and the quiet anxieties of modern living.

So, a few weeks back, I had a minor surgery. Nothing dramatic, thankfully, just something that needed sorting. The whole process was surprisingly efficient – the NHS, bless them, were brilliant. I was in and out quicker than I anticipated, and, fueled by a potent combination of post-anaesthetic fuzziness and sheer relief, I practically bolted out of the hospital doors.

That’s when the regret hit.

Apparently, while I was recovering, Warwick Davis – *the* Warwick Davis, of Ewok and Professor Flitwick fame – was visiting with his wife. A friend who’d been having a longer stay spotted them and sent me a message: "You missed him! He was just down the corridor!"

My jaw literally dropped. I’m a massive fan, obviously. Who isn’t? But beyond the geeky excitement, it was the sheer *missed opportunity* that stung.  Just a few minutes. If I’d waited, if I hadn't been so eager to be home, I could have said hello, maybe even managed a quick, awkward selfie.

It sounds ridiculous, I know. A fleeting encounter with a celebrity shouldn't be a source of lasting disappointment. But it's become a little metaphor for so much else, hasn't it?  We’re all rushing around, trying to tick off boxes on our to-do lists, optimizing every moment.  We’re so focused on the *next* thing, on the future, that we often miss the present.

2021 has been a year of heightened awareness, hasn’t it? A year of appreciating small joys, and acutely feeling the weight of things lost or missed. The pandemic has forced us to be mindful of the fragility of connection, the importance of presence. 

Maybe this whole Warwick Davis incident is a little nudge to slow down, to breathe, and to be a little more open to the unexpected. Because you never know when a chance encounter – or a moment of genuine connection – might be just around the corner. And it would be a shame to miss it.
