**Lost in Translation, Found in Sound**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single song can pull you in? Last year, I stumbled upon Potage, a Japanese band, and I was utterly captivated. I don’t speak Japanese, and honestly, most of the lyrics were a blur, but the *feeling*… it was incredible. 

It sparked this whole wave of cultural curiosity. I started digging deeper, trying to glean the emotions behind the music, piecing together stories through translations and online communities. It's a reminder that music transcends language—it’s about connection, right?  What’s a song or artist that’s currently grabbing *your* attention?
