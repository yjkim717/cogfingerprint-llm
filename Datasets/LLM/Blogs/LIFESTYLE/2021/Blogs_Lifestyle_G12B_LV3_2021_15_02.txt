## The “What If” That Still Lingers (and a Brush with Warwick Davis!)

It’s funny, isn’t it, how life throws these little curveballs that leave you pondering a “what if?” long after the dust has settled? I’ve been thinking about one recently, a small moment from late 2021 that still manages to prickle with a touch of regret.

I’d just come out of a minor surgery – nothing serious, thankfully - and was eager to get back to normal. I was bouncing with that post-hospital energy, that slightly manic desire to reclaim my life. The nurses were saying I was probably pushing it a bit, that another few hours rest wouldn't hurt, but I was convinced I was fine. I wanted to be home, curled up on the sofa with a good book, and frankly, just out of the sterile hospital environment. So, I signed the forms and practically bolted.

Looking back, I realize how foolishly hasty I was.

The regret isn’t about the surgery itself; it's about something that happened *in* the hospital. As I was being discharged, I overheard a buzz of excitement. Turns out, Warwick Davis – yes, *the* Warwick Davis, from *Harry Potter* and *Star Wars* – was also being discharged! Apparently, he and his wife were recovering from something unrelated, and were just heading home.

Now, I'm not a huge fanboy, but the man's a legend! A childhood dream of meeting him flickered briefly, and I thought, 'Well, maybe I'll just pop out, say hello, wish him well…' But no. I was fueled by my desperate need to escape, and I hurried out into the parking lot, completely oblivious.

It wasn't until a friend later recounted seeing him leaving the hospital, beaming and surrounded by well-wishers, that the full weight of my missed opportunity hit me.

It's a small thing, I know. A fleeting encounter with a celebrity isn't life-altering. But it's become a tiny, persistent reminder to slow down, to be present, and to appreciate the unexpected moments that life presents. To not rush past a chance for connection, even if it’s just a brief, friendly hello. 

It’s a good lesson, really. Sometimes, the best moments aren't planned; they’re simply *there*, waiting to be noticed. And sometimes, all it takes is a little less eagerness to leave and a little more willingness to linger.
