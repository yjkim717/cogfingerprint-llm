## Dust, Dragons, and Drafts

It's 2021, and my life feels delightfully absurd. By day, I’m hauling coal – a proper, gritty, honest job. Then, after a shower and a change of clothes, I’m lost in fantastical worlds, battling dragons in video games. And in the wee hours, fueled by lukewarm tea, I'm trying to string words together, dreaming of being a ‘world-renowned author.’ 

It’s a strange combination, isn’t it? A miner, a gamer, and an aspiring wordsmith. Maybe the grit informs the stories, or maybe it's just the beautiful chaos of a life lived a little differently.
