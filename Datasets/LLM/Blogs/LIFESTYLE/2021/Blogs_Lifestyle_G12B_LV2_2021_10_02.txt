## Saturdays & Shared Strength

It's funny how a single day can become a lifeline. For me, Saturdays in 2021 have been anchored by the r/stopdrinking community's "Saturday Share." Seeing others bravely lay bare their struggles, their victories, their *life* after choosing sobriety… it's profoundly moving. It’s a powerful reminder that I'm not alone on this journey. If you're navigating recovery, consider sharing your story. Your vulnerability might be exactly what someone else needs to keep going. Let's build each other up, one Saturday at a time.
