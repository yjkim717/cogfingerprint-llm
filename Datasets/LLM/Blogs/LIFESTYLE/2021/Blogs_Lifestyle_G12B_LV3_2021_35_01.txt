## The Gentle Expansion of My Digital Life (and My Patience!)

Okay, so here's the thing: I'm finally tackling a project I've been putting off for ages – expanding my QNAP TS-453Be NAS. It's become the heart of my home entertainment setup, running Plex and storing… well, *everything*. But four drives just weren't cutting it anymore.

I’m adding a TR-004 expansion unit, and let me tell you, it’s been a learning curve! Trying to maintain my existing RAID 5 setup while slowly adding drives is proving to be a delicate dance. It’s a good reminder that even tech upgrades require a bit of patience and careful planning. It's not just about the hardware; it's about the process, the anticipation, and the quiet satisfaction of building something that truly supports your digital life. Wish me luck!
