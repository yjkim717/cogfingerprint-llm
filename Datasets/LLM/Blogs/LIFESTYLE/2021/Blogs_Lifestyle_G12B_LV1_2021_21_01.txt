## The Train Ride Home and the FOMO It Brings

It's late October 2021, and the leaves are doing that whole gorgeous, Instagram-worthy thing. But I'm not watching it from a cozy dorm room window. I'm on the 8:17 train, heading home after another day of classes. Commuting was the financially responsible choice, no question. College is expensive, and living at home with my parents definitely eased the burden.

But lately, the weight of that decision feels different. I see snippets on Instagram – dorm room study sessions, late-night pizza runs, spontaneous dance parties – and a pang of… something hits me. FOMO, I guess. Everyone talks about the "college experience," and I’m starting to realize it's less about lectures and more about the shared living, the unexpected connections forged in close quarters. 

I'm making friends, sure, but it’s a different kind of friendship. It lacks that shared history, that constant proximity. Maybe I made the right choice practically, but sometimes, I wonder what I'm missing.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
