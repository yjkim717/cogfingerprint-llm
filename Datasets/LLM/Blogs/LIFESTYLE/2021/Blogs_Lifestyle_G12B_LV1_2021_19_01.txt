## The Unexpected Patience of Pottery

It's funny, isn't it, how hobbies teach you things you never expected? I started pottery a few months ago, thinking I'd be throwing beautiful bowls in no time. Instead, I’ve learned a *lot* about patience and precision. My first few attempts were…well, let's just say they resembled abstract blobs more than anything functional. It’s a bit like building a PC, really. You need to make sure everything is compatible, every step planned. One wrong move and the whole thing crumbles. Now, slowly, I’m getting the hang of it. And that’s a pretty good feeling.
