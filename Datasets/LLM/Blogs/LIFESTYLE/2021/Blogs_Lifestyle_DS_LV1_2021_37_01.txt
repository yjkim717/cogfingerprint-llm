### The Emptiness Behind the "Good" Choices

It’s 2021, and by all external metrics, I should be proud. I’m 31, in nursing school, and finally getting my life “on track.” I meal prep, I go for runs, I’m doing everything the self-improvement blogs told me to.

So why do I feel so hollow?

It’s a specific kind of emptiness. It’s not a loud, screaming sadness, but a quiet hum of detachment. I can be in a lecture about saving lives or laughing with friends, and feel like I’m watching myself on a screen. I’m going through the motions of a life I built because it was the “right” thing to do—a stable career to manage my debt, healthy habits to fix my head.

But the feeling persists. My therapist says I’m emotionally detached, that I’m so focused on the checklist of a good life that I’ve forgotten to live it. The student debt and relationship strains are real, but they’re just background noise to this core numbness.

Maybe the biggest change I need isn’t a new career, but to finally stop running from this feeling and ask it what it wants. Maybe the answer isn’t on another checklist at all.
