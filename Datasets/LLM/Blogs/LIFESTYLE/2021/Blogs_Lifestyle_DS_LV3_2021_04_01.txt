There I was in the spring of 2021, drill in hand, staring at my pristine new garage siding. My simple mission—to hang a solid house number plaque—had become a full-blown dilemma. Every traditional method felt wrong; I couldn’t bear the thought of drilling holes that might invite moisture or relying on flimsy siding clips that I just didn’t trust.

It got me thinking: how often do we apply old solutions to new problems, assuming they’ll hold? That plaque was more than an address—it was a statement. I wanted it secure, without compromising the integrity of my home. Sometimes, the right approach means pausing, questioning the norm, and finding a sturdier way to hang what matters. A little caulk and careful planning made all the difference.
