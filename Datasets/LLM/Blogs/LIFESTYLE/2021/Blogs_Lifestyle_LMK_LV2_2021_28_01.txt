As I pondered the mysteries of a split laser beam in 2021, I realized that life is much like light interference - our paths converge and diverge, creating unique patterns. Just as energy conservation governs the physical world, our choices shape our lives. I'm reminded to be mindful of my daily decisions, embracing the harmony that arises from balancing opposing forces, much like the recombined laser beam, and finding equilibrium in a chaotic world.
