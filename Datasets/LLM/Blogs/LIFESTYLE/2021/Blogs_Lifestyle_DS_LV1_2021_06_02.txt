It’s 2021, and my Pixel 6 Pro promised to capture life’s fleeting moments. But lately, I’ve been waiting—20, 30 seconds—for a single night shot to process. At first, it felt frustrating, this digital pause. Now, I see it differently. In our rush to document everything, this forced stillness is a gift. While the phone works its magic, I’m just… present, watching the city lights blur into starlight. Sometimes, the best moments aren’t just in the photo, but in the quiet space it creates.
