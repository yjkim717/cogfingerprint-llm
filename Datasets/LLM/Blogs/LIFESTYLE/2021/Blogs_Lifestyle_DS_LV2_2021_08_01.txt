### Paw Prints in the Sand: Prepping My Pup for the Desert

It’s 2021, and after a year of feeling cooped up, the call of the wide-open desert is irresistible. My new camping plan, however, has four paws and a wagging tail. My puppy, Barley, is my ultimate adventure buddy, but the thought of that brutal desert heat gives me pause.

I found myself falling down an online rabbit hole one evening: “Are dog shoes ridiculous or essential?” and “Can a cooling vest really make a difference?” It felt a little silly, ordering a tiny pair of rugged booties, but the image of his sensitive pads on scorching sand trumped my pride. This isn’t just about gear; it’s about re-learning how to explore, with his safety and comfort as my new north star.

Preparing for this trip has been a beautiful reminder that the best adventures are the ones we take care of each other. Here’s to new trails, shaded rests, and watching Barley experience the vast, starry desert sky for the very first time.
