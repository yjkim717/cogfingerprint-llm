**Diving into the Digital Wilderness**

Honestly, 2021 felt like I was staring into a digital wilderness. Crypto and blockchain were buzzing everywhere, but I just didn’t *get* it.

It’s been a slow burn, but finally understanding the blockchain ecosystem feels… empowering. It’s a weird, wild space, but I'm happy to be exploring!
