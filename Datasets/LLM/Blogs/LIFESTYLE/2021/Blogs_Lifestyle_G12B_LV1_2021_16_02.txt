## The Point of Diminishing Returns (and Guitars)

It's 2021, and I’ve been thinking a lot about value lately. Not just in the monetary sense, but in the whole *effort vs. reward* equation. It started with my guitar. I’d been happily strumming on a decent, mid-range instrument for years, but the upgrade bug bit me hard. Should I finally take the plunge into the world of high-end guitars?

The price jump is *staggering*. And honestly, is the sonic difference really worth the investment? It feels strangely analogous to so many other areas of life. That fancy coffee machine? The premium gym membership? The designer handbag? 

There's a point, I suspect, where the incremental gain simply doesn't justify the cost. A point of diminishing returns. I'm still searching for that point with my guitar, and in figuring it out, I'm realizing it's a lesson that applies far beyond my music room.
