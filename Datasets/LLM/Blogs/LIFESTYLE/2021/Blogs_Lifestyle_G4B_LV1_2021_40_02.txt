**The Year I Tried to Break Free**

It feels weird writing this now, but 2021 was a turning point for me. I’d fallen into a pretty comfortable, yet deeply unsatisfying, routine of porn and excessive masturbation. It was… automatic. Then I stumbled across NoFap, and the idea of a structured challenge really resonated. 

I decided to go for a 30-day “reset,” a strict no-porn, no-masturbation period. Honestly, the first few days were brutal. The urges were intense, and I felt a massive sense of loss. But slowly, something shifted. I started noticing things – the quiet moments, the genuine connections with friends, and a surprising clarity of thought. It wasn’t about shame, it was about reclaiming my attention.  It was a tough challenge, but a rewarding one.
