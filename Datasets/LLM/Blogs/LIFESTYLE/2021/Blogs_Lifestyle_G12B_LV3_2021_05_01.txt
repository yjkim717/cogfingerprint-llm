## The Night My PC Kept Me Up (and What It Taught Me About Letting Go)

Okay, so maybe it sounds silly, but for a solid week last fall, my computer was driving me absolutely *bonkers*. It just wouldn't sleep properly. I'd put it to bed, thinking I could finally relax after a long day of working from home in 2021 (remember those days?), and then *bam* – it’d randomly wake up in the middle of the night. Worse, all my peripherals would be frozen, forcing a hard reset. 

Honestly, it felt like a metaphor for my life at the time. I was constantly trying to "shut down," to disconnect, but my brain was buzzing with to-do lists and anxieties, pulling me back in. I spent hours troubleshooting – checking drivers, fiddling with power settings, questioning every peripheral I owned.

Eventually, I realized the problem wasn't just about hardware or software. It was about me holding on too tightly. Maybe the computer needed to rest, and so did I. Now, I make a real effort to truly disconnect before bed. No screens, a good book, and a conscious decision to let go. My PC still occasionally wakes up, but now I'm a little better at sleeping through the chaos.
