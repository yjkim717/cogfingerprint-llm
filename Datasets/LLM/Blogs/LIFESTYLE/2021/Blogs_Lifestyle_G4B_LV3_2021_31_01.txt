**The Kitchen Chaos of 2021**

Anyone else feel like their homes became… well, *things* during 2021? The pandemic threw everything into disarray, and for my family, that manifested in a serious kitchen clutter crisis. Suddenly, we were buying everything – extra pasta, endless boxes of tea, enough toilet paper to build a small fort – and it just… stayed. 

It wasn't just about the stuff; it was the resistance to actually *organize* it.  Every attempt at a tidy-up was met with a chorus of "I might need that!"  Honestly, it was incredibly frustrating.  I started feeling this low-level anxiety just walking into the kitchen. 

Looking back, it’s a surprisingly poignant reminder that sometimes, our homes reflect our anxieties, and tackling clutter isn’t just about tidiness, it’s about reclaiming a little peace of mind.  It’s a work in progress, of course, but at least I’m recognizing the connection!
