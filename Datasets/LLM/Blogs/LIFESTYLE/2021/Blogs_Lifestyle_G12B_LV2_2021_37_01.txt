## The Shiny New Life Doesn't Always Feel Shiny

Remember 2020? We all do. A year of upheaval, uncertainty, and a collective holding of breath. I emerged on the other side, determined to *do* things differently. I got a new job – one I genuinely felt excited about. I started exercising regularly. I even redecorated my apartment (finally!). On paper, my life looked… good. Really good, actually.

And yet… there's this persistent hum of emptiness. Like a beautiful song playing in a room where I’m just standing in the corner, not really *feeling* it. I've talked to friends, and some of them are feeling it too. It's strange, isn't it? We’re ticking boxes – the “adulting” ones – and still feeling… detached.

It’s not that I'm unhappy. It’s more like I'm observing happiness, rather than experiencing it fully. The motivation to do *anything* beyond the bare minimum feels exhausting. Scrolling through Instagram doesn't help, of course. Everyone else seems to be thriving.

I've started exploring therapy, which has been incredibly helpful in unpacking some of this. It’s making me realize that "fixing" my life wasn't the answer. Finding *meaning* in it is. And that’s a process, not a destination.  I'm starting small – volunteering at a local animal shelter, trying to connect with people beyond surface-level conversations. It's a slow build, but it feels… real. Maybe the shiny new life just needs a little more soul.
