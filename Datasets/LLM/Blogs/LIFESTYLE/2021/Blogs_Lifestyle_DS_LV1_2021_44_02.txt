### The Unfinished Feeling: When Life’s Big Moments Feel Rushed

I was cleaning out my closet last weekend—a classic 2021 lockdown activity—when I found my old, battered box set of the *Bleach* manga. Flipping through the final volume, that familiar, slightly hollow feeling settled in my stomach. It took me a moment to place it, but then I realized: it’s the same feeling I got after my own graduation party in 2021.

We’d all waited for that moment for years. The caps, the gowns, the triumphant toss into the air. But after eighteen months of Zoom lectures and isolated study sessions, the actual event felt… compressed. It was like the universe had fast-forwarded through the third act. We got the ceremony, the photos, the quick, emotional hugs, but it lacked the slow, satisfying burn of a journey concluded. It felt, to borrow a term from my fellow anime fans, *rushed*.

And that’s the exact critique many have of *Bleach*’s ending. After hundreds of chapters of epic world-building and complex characters, the finale seemed to focus intensely on one core relationship—Ichigo and Rukia—in a way that, for some, felt unearned. It wasn't that their bond wasn't important; it was the foundation of the entire story! But in homing in on it so sharply at the finish line, it felt like a dozen other compelling threads were left dangling. The conclusion was there, but the *fulfillment* was missing.

I see this "rushed conclusion" pattern everywhere now, especially after the time-warp that was the pandemic. We’re so eager to reach the milestone—the new job, the end of a project, the post-vaccine reunion—that we sometimes forget to live the chapters that get us there. We want the final, triumphant panel without doing all the intricate line-work in between.

My graduation party was our "final chapter." We were so focused on achieving that singular moment of celebration that we didn't properly address the unresolved plot points: the friendships that had frayed from lack of contact, the collective anxiety we all carried, the quiet uncertainty about what came next. We tried to force a perfect ending onto a messy, incomplete story.

The lesson I’m trying to learn, both from Kubo’s controversial vision and my own life, is to resist the rush. A satisfying ending isn’t about tying everything up with a neat bow. It’s about honoring the entire journey—the messy sub-plots, the quiet character developments, and even the unresolved questions. It’s about ensuring that the final focus feels earned because the path to it was fully travelled.

Maybe the real goal isn't a perfect ending, but a complete experience. And that’s something worth building, one deliberate chapter at a time.
