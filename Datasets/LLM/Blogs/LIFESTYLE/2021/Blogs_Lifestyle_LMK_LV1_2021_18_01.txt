**The Weight of What Could've Been**

As I sit here in 2021, reflecting on the journey that has brought me to this moment, I'm hit with a familiar wave of regret. It's a feeling I've grown all too accustomed to, one that often leaves me wrestling with depression. My mind starts to wander, comparing my path to those of my loved ones - my siblings thriving in their careers, my parents enjoying the fruits of their hard work, and my friends seemingly crushing their goals. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in neutral, replaying the what-ifs and maybes that have defined my adult life.

Becoming a father hasn't made things easier. In fact, it's amplified these feelings. I worry that I'm not setting a good example for my kids, that my stagnation will somehow hold them back. The pressure to be a role model is suffocating at times. I feel like I'm failing not just myself, but my family too.

But as I navigate these dark thoughts, I'm trying to shift my focus towards self-improvement. I'm recognizing that my worth isn't measured by the successes of those around me. I'm taking small steps towards a better tomorrow - reading self-help books, seeking out new opportunities, and practicing self-care. It's a slow process, but I'm learning to be kinder to myself, to acknowledge that my journey is unique. I'm not where I want to be, but I'm working on it. And that's a start.
