## The Ghosts of Online Gaming Past

It's funny, isn't it, how nostalgia can hit you like a wall? Lately, I've been down a rabbit hole revisiting *Rainbow Six Vegas* and *Rainbow Six Vegas 2*. The single-player campaigns were fantastic back in the day, but the real magic was the frantic, tactical multiplayer. 

Except… it’s gone. Or at least, incredibly difficult to access. Despite whispers online of servers still clinging to life, connecting feels like chasing a ghost. It’s a frustrating reminder of how quickly online communities can vanish, leaving behind only echoes of shared experiences.

This got me thinking about all the online games I loved that are now inaccessible. It makes you appreciate the games that *do* keep their communities alive. Anyone else remember struggling to find a working server for older titles? And does anyone know if *Rainbow Six 3* or *Lockdown* still offer a flicker of online life? Asking for a friend… (who is definitely me).
