"As I prep for my next stargazing adventure in 2021, I'm on the hunt for the perfect carrying case for my Celestron OTA and fork mount. It's surprising how hard it is to find one that fits like a glove. I've tried a few options, but they all seem to fall short. Anyone else out there have a similar struggle? I'm starting to think a custom solution might be in order - anyone got any DIY tips to share?"
