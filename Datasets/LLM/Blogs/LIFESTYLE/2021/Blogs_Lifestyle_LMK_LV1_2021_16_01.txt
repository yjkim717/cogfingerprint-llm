"My Katana 50MK2 was being stubborn, refusing to switch to channel 2 when I pressed the 'a' button on my foot controller. After some trial and error, I realized I had accidentally set the switch pedal to latch mode. Who knew?! As I corrected the setting, I realized that, just like my gear, life can be finicky too. Sometimes, it's just a matter of tweaking our approach to get things working smoothly - a lesson I carried with me into 2021."
