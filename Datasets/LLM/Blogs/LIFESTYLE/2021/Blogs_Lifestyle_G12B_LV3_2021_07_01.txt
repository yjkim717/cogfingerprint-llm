## The Ride Home & Dreams of Enduro Builds

Just got back from a fantastic weekend in Pigeon Forge! My partner and I, both avid mountain bikers from Memphis, soaked up the Tennessee trails. Now, the drive home has us buzzing with ideas. We're seriously considering building some enduro bikes – something to really tackle those steeper descents. Any recommendations for great bike shops along I-40? It’s amazing how a weekend on two wheels can spark so much inspiration!
