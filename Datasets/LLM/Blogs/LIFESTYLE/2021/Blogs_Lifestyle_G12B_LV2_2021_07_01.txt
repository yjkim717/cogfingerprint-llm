## The Unexpected Joy of a Road Trip & Future Trails

Just got back from a long weekend in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee – stunning views and much-needed escape! My partner and I were driving back to Memphis, and the conversation drifted to bikes, naturally. We're dreaming of a future enduro build, but realized we need a reliable bike shop closer to home than our current options. 

It’s funny how a simple trip can spark a new passion. Seeing those Tennessee hills got me itching for more challenging trails. Anyone know of a great shop between Knoxville and Memphis? Recommendations welcome! Maybe this impromptu search will lead to a whole new biking adventure.



Hope you enjoyed it! Let me know if you'd like any revisions.
