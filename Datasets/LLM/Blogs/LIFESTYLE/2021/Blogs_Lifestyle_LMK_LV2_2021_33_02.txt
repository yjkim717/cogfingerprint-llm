As I poured over historical accounts of butch lesbians, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of sorrow. The struggles they faced, the violence they endured, and the marginalization they suffered â€“ it's heartbreaking to think about. As an artist researching queer experiences across different eras, I've come to realize that being visibly queer has always come with a price. From the 1950s to the present day, butch identities have been met with hostility, ridicule, and even brutality. It's 2021, and while we've made progress in LGBTQ+ rights, I was still taken aback by the harsh realities faced by those who came before us. Their stories are a poignant reminder of the importance of our continued fight for equality and acceptance. As I reflect on their experiences, I'm reminded of the power of resilience and the importance of embracing our true selves, no matter the cost.
