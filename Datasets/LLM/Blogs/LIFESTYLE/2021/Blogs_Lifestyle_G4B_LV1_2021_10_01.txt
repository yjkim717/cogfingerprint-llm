**Letting Go of Saturday Shares**

Okay, folks, let’s be honest – 2021 was a *year*. A year of pivots, of figuring things out, and for me, a bit of a bittersweet goodbye to something I’d really grown attached to. For the past few years, I’ve been running Saturday Shares – a little online space where we’d all just check in, share our week, and offer support. It felt good, genuinely good, to be a part of that community.

But, as much as I loved it, it started to feel… uneven. The participation was so wildly inconsistent. Some weeks it was buzzing, others… well, it was just me. And I realized, clinging to a system that wasn’t consistently serving everyone was actually adding to my own stress. 

So, this month, I’m stepping back from leading Saturday Shares. It wasn't a failure, not at all. It was a lesson in letting go and recognizing that sometimes, the most supportive thing you can do is shift your approach. 

We’re exploring some new ways to connect, relying more on our amazing moderators and looking for ways to organically foster support throughout the week.  It’s a change, for sure, but I'm trusting that a different path will still lead us to a stronger, more consistent community.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
