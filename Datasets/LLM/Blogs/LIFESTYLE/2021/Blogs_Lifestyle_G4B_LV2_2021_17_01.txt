**The Ghost of Samsung**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a phone can hold so much of a memory. I’ve been staring at my Samsung S20+ lately, and a strange longing has crept in. It wasn't about the camera, or even the screen – it was the Samsung UI. Clean, intuitive… it just *felt* right. 

Then I started researching. OnePlus 9, specifically. The Snapdragon processor, the promise of Oxygen OS… it felt like revisiting a simpler time. Maybe it’s just nostalgia, but the idea of a phone upgrade feels less about specs and more about a little reset.  What’s pulling *you* towards a change lately?
