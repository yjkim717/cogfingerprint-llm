**Tiny Paws, Big Worries: A Reminder to Slow Down**

It’s funny how quickly life can shift, isn’t it? Just a few months ago, I was juggling work, trying to keep up with everything, and generally feeling like I was sprinting just to stay in place. Then, little Leo – our ridiculously adorable kitten – needed surgery. 

The whole experience was a whirlwind of vet appointments, worried phone calls, and the unsettling sight of tiny stitches and inflammation. It forced me to stop, truly *stop*, and realize how precious these small moments are. 

Watching him recover, slowly but surely, has been a powerful lesson. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most important thing isn’t ticking off a to-do list, but simply being present – offering comfort, checking on a tiny, vulnerable creature, and letting the world slow down just a little.  2021 threw a curveball, and Leo’s recovery helped me catch it.
