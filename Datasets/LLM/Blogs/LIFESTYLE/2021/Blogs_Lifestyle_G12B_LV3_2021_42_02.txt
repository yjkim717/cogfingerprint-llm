>## The Weight of Saturday Nights

It's 2021, and I think we all deserve a little honesty about something. Something that’s been swirling around in my head, and I suspect, in many others too: the complicated, often messy, reality of navigating friendships when alcohol is involved.

I'm not here to preach about abstaining or demonize anyone’s choices. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with a growing discomfort, a quiet frustration that simmers beneath the surface of those Saturday nights we’re *supposed* to enjoy. 

It's the shift. You know the one. The person you know and love, the one who’s thoughtful and kind, suddenly morphs into someone… different. Someone louder, less considerate, sometimes even hurtful. The boundaries we’ve carefully built over years seem to evaporate with each drink.

I've witnessed it firsthand, and I've been on the receiving end. And honestly, it's exhausting. It's the feeling of constantly being on guard, wondering which version of a friend will appear. It's the silent apologies for actions that shouldn’t need apologizing for in the first place. 

For a long time, I tried to accept it. "That's just how people are when they drink," I’d tell myself. I even, briefly, considered alcohol as a way to loosen up, to fit in. But the thought left a bad taste in my mouth, not just literally, but emotionally. Because underneath that frustration, I realized there’s a deeper hurt. A sense of betrayal, maybe. Or perhaps just a profound sadness that people feel the need to alter themselves to feel okay.

This isn't about blaming anyone. It's about acknowledging the weight these interactions carry. It’s about recognizing that true connection shouldn't require a chemical release. It’s about setting boundaries, protecting your energy, and choosing friendships that feel authentic, sober or not. And maybe, just maybe, it’s about questioning the societal pressure to numb ourselves into feeling connected in the first place.
