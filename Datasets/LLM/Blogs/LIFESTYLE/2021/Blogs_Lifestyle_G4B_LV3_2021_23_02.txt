**Finding My Tribe: A Gainesville Apartment Hunt**

2021 felt…big. I was finally heading to the University of Florida, a whole new state, a whole new life. But the biggest, most immediate hurdle? Finding a roommate. Seriously, the housing situation felt like a mini-quest! 

I stumbled upon an ad for a 3/2 apartment – way more space than I’d imagined I’d need – and a girl who seemed genuinely awesome.  Sharing a space felt less daunting when you connected over shared passions – she loved hiking, I was obsessed with documentaries. 

It really got me thinking about the importance of community, especially when you’re starting something new.  A good roommate isn’t just someone to split the bills with; they’re a potential friend, a support system, a little piece of home in a strange new place.  The search for the right fit felt like searching for my tribe, and honestly, it was a surprisingly important step in settling into college life.
