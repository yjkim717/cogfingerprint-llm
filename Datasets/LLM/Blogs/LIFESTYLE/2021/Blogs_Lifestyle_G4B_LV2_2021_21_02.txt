**The Static of a Long Zoom**

There’s a weird stillness settling in, isn't there? Late 2021 felt like a constant blur of video calls and muted backgrounds. Like NFS 2015 graphics – a little fuzzy, a little frustrating – mirroring the way I sometimes felt. Just…slightly out of focus. It’s a reminder to actively seek clarity, to step away from the screen and find a sharper view of the world around me.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a different blog post based on a new prompt?
