**Desert Dreams and Tiny Paws**

2021 felt like a year of big, messy adventures – mostly thanks to Finn, our ridiculously adorable golden retriever puppy. We’d always talked about camping, but the thought of bringing a wriggly ball of fluff into the wilderness seemed… daunting. Then, a friend suggested a desert camping trip – hot, exposed, and utterly perfect for a challenge. 

Suddenly, I was obsessing over things I’d never considered before: his paws, the heat, and how to keep him safe. Dog shoes became a serious research project! It wasn’t just about a cute accessory; it was about protecting those little feet from the scorching sand. 

That trip really shifted something for me. It wasn’t just about planning for Finn’s comfort, it was about pushing my own boundaries as a new dog owner and a planner.  It highlighted the beautiful vulnerability of introducing a new life into an exciting experience.  It reminded me that the best adventures are the ones where we’re both learning and growing, one paw print at a time.
