## The Blur of It All

Remember that feeling in 2015, playing Need for Speed and battling a weird, pervasive blur? It's stuck with me, oddly enough. Lately, life feels a bit like that. Just a constant, soft focus. So many things vying for attention – work, news, relationships – it’s hard to find the sharp edges, the genuine clarity. I'm actively trying to filter, to declutter not just my space, but my mental landscape, hoping to find a little more visual clarity in this chaotic 2021.
