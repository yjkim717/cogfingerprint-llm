As I built my new PC in 2021, I realized that upgrading wasn't just about the hardware. Choosing the right cooler for my Intel 12700K processor made me think about how our tech choices reflect our lifestyle. The Corsair iCUE H100i Elite Capellix was a great fit, but I had to ensure it worked with the LGA1700 socket. It was a great learning experience, and now my rig runs smoothly - a perfect blend of form and function.
