**The Ghost in the Machine (and My Sleepy PC)**

Anyone else feel like their tech sometimes has a mind of its own? It’s a surprisingly unsettling feeling, right? Last month, my trusty PC started doing this weird thing – waking up from sleep mode seemingly at random, but with my mouse and keyboard just…gone. Like, completely unresponsive. 

It was incredibly frustrating, a digital ghost in the machine.  I’d spend ages wrestling with it, eventually needing a full reboot to get things back to normal. It made me think about how reliant we’ve become on these seamless digital experiences, and how jarring it is when they break down. 

It's a small glitch, sure, but it highlighted a bigger point: sometimes, the most frustrating solutions are the simplest – a little reset can bring everything back into focus.  What random tech gremlins have you encountered lately?
