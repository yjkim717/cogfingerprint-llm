## The Headiness of a Vermont Beer and the Weight of Maybe-Regret

It’s funny, isn’t it, how a single moment can trigger a cascade of… well, *feelings*? It happened last weekend, and I’m still untangling the threads. It all started with a casual get-together at a friend’s place. Good company, decent snacks, the usual low-key vibe we’ve all been craving after a year and a half of… well, *gestures vaguely at 2021*.

My friend, Liam, is a serious beer guy. Like, *really* serious. He’s got a collection that rivals a small museum, mostly Vermont brews, many of them limited releases, barrel-aged wonders, the kind of stuff you see whispered about in online forums. I’m a beer drinker, sure, but I’m more of a “cold, refreshing, please” kind of guy.

He pulled out this bottle – a “Heady Topper” variant I’d only ever seen pictures of. It was… intimidating. Beautifully intimidating, with its amber glow and intricate label. He poured me a glass, and honestly, it was incredible. Complex, smooth, a flavor profile I hadn’t experienced before. I savored it, genuinely enjoyed it.

And then the thought hit me.

Liam is *meticulous* about his collection. He catalogs everything, treats each bottle like a tiny, precious artifact. What if… what if this wasn’t just *a* Heady Topper? What if it was *the* Heady Topper? The one he’d been searching for, the one he’d been saving for a special occasion?

Suddenly, the deliciousness turned to a knot of anxiety in my stomach. Social awkwardness bloomed. I didn’t want to ask. I didn’t want to accuse. But the possibility lingered: had I, in a moment of blissful ignorance, consumed a treasured piece of someone else’s passion?

I haven’t said anything. I’m wrestling with this low-level regret, this nagging feeling that I committed some sort of unspoken social faux pas. Maybe it’s silly. Maybe he has a dozen of these. But the thought keeps circling. It’s a reminder that even in the simplest of moments, there’s a potential for missteps, for unintended consequences. And sometimes, the best thing to do is just… wait and see. And maybe, just maybe, avoid accepting rare beers from friends for a little while.
