As I sat huddled over my laptop, scrolling through Reddit threads on ultralight hiking, I stumbled upon a post that caught my eye - a gear list for tackling the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). The author's meticulous planning and attention to detail resonated with me. It wasn't just about the gear; it was about the journey, the people you'd meet, and the lessons you'd learn along the way. As I read on, I realized that the principles of long-distance trekking - simplicity, resilience, and adaptability - aren't just applicable to the wilderness, but to life itself. In 2021, as we navigate the complexities of modern life, I find myself drawn to the idea of stripping back the non-essential and embracing the freedom that comes with it. What's the weight you're carrying, and what's holding you back from taking the first step?
