## The Weight of Unspoken Things

It’s funny, isn't it? How life just… keeps moving, even when you feel like you’re standing still. This year, 2021, has been a masterclass in that. We’re all navigating a world still shadowed by COVID, and the ripples of loss feel unending.

Recently, a friend’s situation landed heavily on my heart. Their ex-partner lost his dad to the virus, a sudden and brutal blow. He's understandably withdrawn, consumed by grief. And I find myself wanting to *fix* it, to magically erase the pain.

But you can’t. You can only offer a steady hand and a listening ear. I’ve been wrestling with how to gently encourage him to consider therapy. It feels intrusive, suggesting someone delve into such raw vulnerability. Yet, I know neglecting mental health during grief can create a deeper, longer-lasting wound.

It’s a reminder to us all, really. To be brave enough to acknowledge the weight of unspoken things, and to extend compassion – both to others and to ourselves - as we navigate these incredibly challenging times.
