**The Waiting Game (and My Pixel 6 Pro)**

Remember those gorgeous, dreamy night shots everyone was posting about? I finally got a Pixel 6 Pro – excited to capture the city after dark. But there’s a weird thing happening. Photos take *forever* to appear, especially when it’s dark. It's almost like the phone is puzzling over every detail.  I keep wondering if it’s a glitch, a quirk of the processing, or maybe just a defective unit. It’s a little frustrating, honestly, when you’re itching to share the moment. Still, I’m hoping it’ll smooth out with an update.
