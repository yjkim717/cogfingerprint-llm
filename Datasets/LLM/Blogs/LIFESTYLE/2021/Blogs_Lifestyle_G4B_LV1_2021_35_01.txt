**Building My Digital Sanctuary**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we start collecting things – not just physical objects, but memories, photos, and, increasingly, media.  I was wrestling with setting up a proper Plex server last year, trying to wrangle my growing collection onto a QNAP TS-453Be.  Adding a TR-004 expansion unit felt like building a little fortress for my digital life. It’s a surprisingly satisfying project – a way to organize chaos and really *own* my entertainment.  It’s not about the tech, really, but about creating a space where I can easily access and enjoy everything I’ve worked to gather.
