Okay, here’s a blog post draft inspired by the summary and keywords, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone, around 185 words, and set in 2021:

**The Saturday Share Shift**

Let’s be honest, 2021 felt… messy. A lot of shifts, a lot of adjustments. I’d gotten really into the Saturday Share ritual within the stopdrinking subreddit – a weekly check-in, a space for honesty. But it kept falling apart. Cancellations piled up, and I realized I was clinging to a structure that wasn't serving me anymore. 

It made me think about *change* – not just in my drinking, but in all the habits I was trying to build.  Sometimes, the most sustainable approach isn't about rigidly sticking to a plan, but about being flexible and responsive. 

So, I tweaked things. Instead of a fixed time and date, I’m now just setting a gentle reminder to myself each Saturday to reflect. It’s about building *community* within myself, a consistent practice of honesty and support.  It’s a small *change*, but it’s proving to be far more *sustainable* than forcing a group meeting.  It’s a reminder that recovery isn't about perfection; it’s about finding what truly nurtures your journey.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
