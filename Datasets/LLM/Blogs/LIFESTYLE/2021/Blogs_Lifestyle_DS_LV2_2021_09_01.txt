Looking back at my 2021 kitchen adventures, I truly embraced the joy of plant-based eating. I found myself fermenting everything in sight and crafting meals where vegetables took center stage. A spoonful of gojuchang became my secret weapon, adding depth to humble lentils and turning simple dishes into vibrant feasts. It wasn't about restriction, but a delicious discoveryâ€”a year of feeling more connected to my food and its flavorful, earthy roots.
