## Are We Rooting for the *Right* Reasons? A 90 Day Fiancé Reflection

Okay, let's be honest, who else is watching *90 Day Fiancé* and feeling…underwhelmed? Lately, I've been scrolling through Reddit threads dissecting Libby and Chuck’s storyline, and a common thread keeps popping up: the lack of genuine effort to mend family rifts. 

It’s 2021, and these folks are raking in money from the show! Shouldn't that incentivize a little more…maturity? I find myself questioning their motivations. Are they truly trying to build a life together, or just playing a role for the cameras? It makes you think about all the reality shows we consume – are we investing in authentic stories, or just manufactured drama?
