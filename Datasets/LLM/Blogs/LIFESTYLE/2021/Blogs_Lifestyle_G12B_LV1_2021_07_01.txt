>## The Dust Settles, and the Questions Pile Up

Just got back from a whirlwind weekend in Pigeon Forge with my partner. The Smoky Mountains are seriously breathtaking – we spent hours hiking, breathing in that crisp mountain air, and generally feeling incredibly disconnected from… well, everything. And of course, we squeezed in some serious mountain biking! 

My partner’s been itching to really level up his ride, talking about a proper enduro build, while I’m content with my trusty cross-country setup for now. The whole trip got me thinking about gear, and how much it reflects our passions. Now we’re heading back to Memphis, and I'm already wondering - where's a good bike shop along the way? Any recommendations, folks? We’re officially in research mode!
