## The Weight of Stories, and Why I Still Carry Them

It's been a weird few weeks. I’ve been diving deep into researching the lives of butch lesbians, particularly those from the mid-20th century. Honestly, it’s been… heavy. Like, *really* heavy. Reading accounts of the casual – and often brutal – discrimination, the constant threat of physical assault, the sheer struggle for basic recognition… it’s a lot to absorb.

I stumbled across some incredible first-person narratives, and some scholarly work echoing those experiences, and the echoes just resonated. It’s easy to feel like we've come so far in 2021, with marriage equality and growing visibility. But reading about the resilience of these women, the ways they carved out spaces for themselves, the coded language and hidden communities… it’s a powerful reminder that progress isn’t linear.

There’s a particular book, *Stone Butch Blues*, that’s been shadowing my thoughts. It’s fictional, but grounded in so much lived reality. It's made me think about the stories we choose to remember, and the ones we’re still uncovering.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I feel a responsibility to carry some of that weight. To acknowledge the sacrifices and struggles that paved the way for me to even *write* this post. It's a constant reminder that the fight for queer liberation is far from over, and that honoring the past is crucial for building a more just future.
