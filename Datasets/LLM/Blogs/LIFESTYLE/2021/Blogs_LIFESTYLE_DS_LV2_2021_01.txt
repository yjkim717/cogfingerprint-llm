Looking back on my 2021 college days, I canâ€™t help but feel a pang of regret. Sure, commuting saved me money, but at what cost? While classmates were bonding over late-night pizza in dorms, I was stuck in traffic, missing out on the spontaneous moments that forge real friendships. That "college experience" everyone talks about? I watched it from the sidelines. Saving a few dollars felt smart then, but now I realize some things are truly priceless.
