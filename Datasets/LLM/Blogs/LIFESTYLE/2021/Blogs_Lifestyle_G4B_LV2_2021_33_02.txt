**The Weight of a History I’m Only Just Unearthing**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How some histories just… settle on you, like a persistent, quiet ache. Lately, I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about butches – not just as a cool, stylish aesthetic, but as a vibrant, complex part of lesbian history. And honestly, it’s been a *lot*.

I’ve been digging into the stories of these women who, for decades, carved out a space of strength and independence, often facing incredible prejudice and erasure. It’s deeply moving, and also, profoundly sad.  I'm trying to understand the emotional toll it must have taken, the constant negotiation of expectations, the feeling of being unseen.

I’m exploring this through a screenplay and some art, trying to give a voice to a history that hasn't always been heard. It’s a messy, vulnerable process, and I'm realizing that learning about these past struggles isn’t just about understanding, it’s about honoring – and carrying forward – a legacy of resilience.
