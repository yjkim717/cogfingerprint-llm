"As I helped my elderly relative book their United international flight from Asia in June 2021, I realized the importance of comfort during long-haul travel. With their fare class L ticket, I explored upgrade options to make their journey more enjoyable. Upgrading their flight became a thoughtful gesture, showing I care. It was a small act that greatly impacted their travel experience, and one that I'll always cherish."
