## K-Pop, Bank Transfers, and a Little Panic

Okay, so I dove into the world of Taizhoufr for some K-Pop posters – totally exciting! But then… whoops! I accidentally chose bank transfer as my payment. It’s 2021, and I’m so used to card payments! Now I'm nervously awaiting a reply, hoping the seller will let me switch. Anyone else ever have a payment mishap like this? Send good vibes!
