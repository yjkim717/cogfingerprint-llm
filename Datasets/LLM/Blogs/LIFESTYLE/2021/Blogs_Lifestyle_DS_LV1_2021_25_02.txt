Remember that co-op bug in *Journey to the Savage Planet* back in 2021? My friend and I were stuck on Sychi’s trial for days. We’d die in the laser maze, and the whole challenge would just… break. No reset, no retry.

It was a frustrating glitch, but it taught me a weirdly profound lesson about life. Sometimes you hit a wall so hard the system itself seems to crash. The only way forward isn't to force it, but to take a breath, shut everything down, and restart with a fresh perspective. A hard reset can be the most productive move of all.
