**The Year the Houses Started Talking**

2021… it feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it?  A year that shifted everything, not just for the world, but for me personally. I’d been diligently tracking my FIRE journey – the pursuit of financial independence – for years, meticulously saving and investing. I felt like I was building a solid foundation. 

Then, the real estate market went absolutely *wild*. Suddenly, the houses I’d been eyeing were appreciating at a rate I couldn’t have imagined. It was a genuine real estate boom, and it threw my carefully laid plans into a bit of a tailspin. 

I started getting calls about refinancing, and the concept of a cash buyer felt less like a distant dream and more like a real possibility.  It forced me to really examine my priorities. Was I still solely focused on accumulating wealth, or was there a different kind of security I was missing – the security of owning a home? 

It was a surprisingly humbling experience, a reminder that sometimes, life throws you a curveball, and it's okay to adjust your game.
