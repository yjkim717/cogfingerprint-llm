### The Midnight Mask Chase: My Quest for a Good Night's Sleep

It’s 2021, and like many, my world has shrunk to the four walls of my home. You’d think getting a decent night’s sleep would be the one easy win, right? Not for me. As a CPAP user, my nights have become a battleground, and the enemy is my own equipment.

For months, my old nasal mask was my frenemy. It delivered the air I needed, but it had a mind of its own. Every time I rolled onto my side—*poof*—a hiss of escaping air would jolt me awake. The headgear straps felt like a too-tight headband by 3 AM, and let’s not even talk about the constant mask cleaning routine. It started to feel less like a health device and more like a high-maintenance pet.

So, I declared war on bad sleep. I dove into online forums, determined to find "The One"—a mask that would stay put and let me sleep like a normal person. The search felt endless, but it was a project, a mission in a year starved for them. I’m now on my third trial mask, a minimalist set of nasal pillows, and the difference is astounding. It’s a small victory in the grand scheme of things, but finally winning the battle for a peaceful night? It feels like reclaiming a piece of myself I didn’t even know I’d lost.
