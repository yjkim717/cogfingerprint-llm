As I sat by the campfire in 2021, reflecting on my thru-hike aspirations, I couldn't help but wonder what it would take to tackle the Continental Divide Trail solo and ultralight. I'd been pouring over gear lists and Reddit threads, and I started to dream up my own theoretical kit. The idea of carrying every ounce on my back, relying on nothing but my wits and a carefully curated pack, was exhilarating. I began to scribble down notes, weighing the trade-offs between comfort and weight, and imagining the freedom that came with shedding unnecessary grams. As the night wore on, my gear list took shape, and with it, a vision of myself traversing the CDT, unencumbered and alive. It was a tantalizing prospect, one that I'd carry with me long after the fire burned out, and into the adventures of the coming year.
