**Navigating the Challenges of Sixth Form as an External Student**

As I stepped into the bustling corridors of my new sixth form college in 2021, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. Excitement for the new chapter ahead, but also a tinge of anxiety about navigating an unfamiliar environment. Being an external student, I wasn't part of the traditional school-to-sixth-form progression, and this added to my apprehensions. I was about to embark on a two-year journey with a new set of people, and the pressure to fit in was palpable.

At first, it wasn't easy. I struggled to connect with my peers, and the feeling of being an outsider was overwhelming. The cliques were already formed, and it seemed like everyone knew each other from their previous schools. I, on the other hand, was the new kid on the block, trying to break into a tight-knit community. I attended clubs and societies, hoping to meet like-minded people, but it wasn't until I participated in a volunteer event that I started to feel a sense of belonging.

However, despite these efforts, I still found myself feeling lonely and isolated at times. The college environment, while stimulating, was also incredibly demanding. The workload was heavy, and the expectations were high. I began to feel like I was drowning in a sea of assignments and exams, with no lifeline in sight. My mental health started to suffer, and I found myself withdrawing from social interactions, fearing that I wasn't good enough or that I didn't fit in.

It was during one of these low moments that I realized I wasn't alone. Many of my peers were struggling with similar issues â€“ the pressure to perform, the fear of not meeting expectations, and the strain on their mental well-being. We started to open up to each other, sharing our struggles and supporting one another through the tough times. It was a turning point for me, and I began to feel more connected to my college community.

Looking back, I realize that being an external student in a sixth form college presented its unique challenges. But it also taught me valuable lessons about resilience, adaptability, and the importance of reaching out for help when needed. As I continue on this journey, I'm learning to navigate the ups and downs with a greater sense of confidence and self-awareness. To anyone who might be facing similar struggles, I want to say that you're not alone, and that with time, patience, and support, you too can find your footing in a new environment.
