As I navigated my daily routine in 2021, I stumbled upon a frustrating hurdle - a Google Form that required me to sign in to respond. This sign-in requirement not only felt invasive but also raised some red flags about phishing concerns. I began to wonder, was this really necessary? By limiting form accessibility, weren't we potentially excluding valuable feedback from users who just wanted to share their thoughts? It got me thinking - how can we strike a balance between security and user experience in our increasingly digital lives?
