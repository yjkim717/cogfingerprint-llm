It’s 2021, and on paper, I’m doing everything right. I wake up early, meditate, and have a career plan that looks impressive in a Zoom meeting. I’m chasing self-improvement with a kind of frantic energy, ticking boxes for a future that’s supposed to feel fulfilling.

But here’s the quiet truth I rarely say out loud: beneath the productivity hacks and goal-setting, there’s this hollow feeling—a persistent emptiness that no amount of achievement seems to fill. I can be in a room full of people (or a crowded video call) and feel completely detached, wrapped in a loneliness I don’t know how to explain.

I’ve thought about therapy, but between the cost and the waitlists, it feels like another mountain to climb. So I keep going, hoping that the next career change or personal milestone will be the one that makes me feel… something. Real. Connected. But the chase itself is starting to feel like the problem. Maybe the answer isn’t in doing more, but in learning how to be—right here, in the uncomfortable quiet.
