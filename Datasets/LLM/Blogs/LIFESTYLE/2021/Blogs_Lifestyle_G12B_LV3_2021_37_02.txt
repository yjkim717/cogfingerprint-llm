## The Bookshelf Became My Therapist (For a Little While…)

2021 has been… a lot, hasn’t it? For me, juggling work, life, and the ever-present hum of ADHD has felt particularly challenging. Finding consistent therapy has been tricky, to say the least. So, I did what any resourceful (and slightly overwhelmed) person would do: I turned to books.

I stumbled across a Reddit thread recently where someone was asking for recommendations for therapy books geared towards ADHD. It resonated so deeply! Diving into resources like *Driven to Distraction* and exploring cognitive behavioral techniques felt like a small, but powerful, step. It's not a replacement for professional help, of course, but those pages offered a lifeline and a sense of control when I needed it most. Anyone else found solace in the written word during these times?
