### The Joy of the Second Act

It’s funny how the things we once cast aside can become our greatest projects. In 2021, as the world was still figuring out its new rhythm, I found myself staring at my old, trusty mountain bike from the ‘90s, collecting dust in the garage. It was a relic, but a solid one. Instead of dreaming of a shiny new gravel bike, a different idea took root: what if I gave this old friend a second life?

I’ll be honest, I’m no master mechanic. But armed with a set of bike tools and a healthy dose of YouTube tutorials, I embarked on a drop bar conversion. Swapping the flat bars for drops felt like giving the bike a new personality. The real puzzle was the drivetrain, but a pair of simple friction bar-end shifters, paired with the original MTB derailleurs, turned out to be a beautifully simple, almost zen-like solution.

This wasn’t just about building a bike; it was a lesson in resourcefulness. In a world obsessed with the new and next, there’s a profound satisfaction in reimagining what’s already there. That first ride on my “new” gravel bike wasn’t just a ride; it was a quiet celebration of potential, found not in a store, but right there in my own garage.
