## Feeling Overwhelmed? Maybe It's Time to Tame Your Time.

Okay, let's be honest, 2021 has been… a lot. Between navigating the ongoing uncertainty and just trying to keep up with everything, I've felt constantly swamped. But I've been experimenting with something lately that's actually making a difference: intentional time management. 

It's not about squeezing every last drop out of the day, it's about *choosing* where to focus my energy. I started using my calendar as more than just a meeting scheduler – I actually block out time for specific tasks. Sounds rigid, I know! But paired with a simple timer, it's surprisingly effective at battling procrastination and keeping me on track. 

It's a work in progress, definitely, but reclaiming even a little bit of control over my day has been a game-changer for my overall well-being. Anyone else trying to find a little more calm amidst the chaos?
