### The Sobering View from the Driver's Seat

It was a Friday night in late 2021, and I was the designated driver—again. From my perch on a wobbly bar stool, sipping a club soda, I watched the room transform. Laughter grew louder, conversations looped, and coordination dwindled. It was a scene I knew all too well, but this time, I saw it with a painful new clarity.

A guy at the next table, who had been amiably chatting an hour before, was now slurring insults at his friend. The shift was so sudden, so pointless. It brought back a flood of my own memories—the kind I’ve spent years in therapy trying to soothe. I couldn’t help but wonder: what is the actual goal here? Is this temporary escape, this loss of control, really worth the hangover, the regret, or the harm we can cause?

Being the sober one that night was a revelation. It wasn’t about judging my friends; it was about seeing the "fun" for what it often is—a mask for something messier. I drove everyone home safely, but the real journey was the one in my head. I’m not saying I’ll never have a drink again, but I am saying I now question the culture that insists it’s the only way to connect. Sometimes, the most meaningful perspective comes from the one who remembers the whole night.
