## The Illusion of Control (and Why It’s Okay to Miss)

It’s funny the things that can feel like metaphors for life, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been losing my mind trying to perfect my hit-and-run strategy in MLB The Show. I'm making *perfect* contact, the kind that sends the ball screaming off the bat, but the results just aren't there. Groundouts, pop-ups... frustratingly consistent outs.

It got me thinking. How often do we, like, meticulously plan and execute our moves – adjusting all the sliders of our lives – and still feel like we’re coming up short? We’re doing *everything* right, by our standards, and the outcome just...isn't.

Maybe the point isn’t flawless execution. Maybe it's accepting that even with the best contact, even with all the adjustments, sometimes you miss.  2021 has been a year of a lot of adjustments for everyone, hasn’t it? And it's kind of liberating to realize that missing isn't failure. It’s just… part of the game.  Now, back to trying to steal a base. Wish me luck!
