"As I sat on my couch in 2021, controller in hand, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with MLB The Show's franchise mode on veteran level. Despite my player having great contact ratings, I just couldn't seem to get those hits. It was a humbling experience, reminding me that sometimes, no matter how much skill you have, things just don't go your way - a lesson that's just as applicable to life as it is to gaming."
