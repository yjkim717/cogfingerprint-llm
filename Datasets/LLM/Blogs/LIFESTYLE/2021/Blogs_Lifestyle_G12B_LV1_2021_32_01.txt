## Seattle Hustle: Can You Really Thrive on $19 an Hour?

Okay, real talk. Living in Seattle is *beautiful*, but it’s also pricey. I’m currently pulling in $19 an hour in a serving job, and honestly? It’s getting tight. Rent, groceries, even just the occasional coffee – it all adds up fast. I’m starting to seriously look for something that bumps that hourly rate up to at least $25, ideally $35. Anyone else feeling the squeeze in the Emerald City? What’s the secret to making it work? I’m all ears (and actively job hunting!).
