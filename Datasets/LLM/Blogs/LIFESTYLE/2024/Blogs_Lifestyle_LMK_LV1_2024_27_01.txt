"After being rejected from my dream MBA program in 2024 due to a lackluster take-home assignment, I was left wondering what went wrong. Upon reflection, I realized my qualitative analysis was shallow. To improve, I'm now seeking tips from industry insiders. The recruitment process is tough, but I'm determined to crack it next time. Wish me luck - I'm redoubling my efforts to showcase my skills and land my ideal role."
