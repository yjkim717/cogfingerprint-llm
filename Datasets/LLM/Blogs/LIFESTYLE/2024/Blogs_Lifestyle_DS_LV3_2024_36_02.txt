It’s 2024, and I’m still fumbling with my phone to add events to my calendar. You’d think with my Galaxy S20 and Google Assistant, it’d be seamless—just speak or snap a picture of a flyer. But reality? Voice input mishears me, and image scanning feels hit-or-miss. I dream of an app that truly gets it: letting me choose exactly which calendar to use, whether it’s work or personal, without the extra taps. In our fast-paced lives, shouldn’t technology smooth out these little wrinkles, not add to them? Here’s hoping for a smarter solution soon.
