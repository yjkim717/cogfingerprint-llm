**The Weight of a House, the Weight of a Memory**

It’s strange, isn’t it? Receiving an inheritance – a house, a piece of someone’s life – and suddenly feeling utterly adrift? I recently inherited a small cottage in the countryside, and the initial excitement quickly morphed into a hefty dose of uncertainty. How do you put a price on a space filled with echoes? 

Getting an appraisal felt less like determining value and more like trying to capture a feeling. It’s a reminder that things – and the people connected to them – hold a value beyond just dollars and cents. Right now, I’m focusing on honoring that legacy, and figuring out the *real* worth of this place, both emotionally and practically.
