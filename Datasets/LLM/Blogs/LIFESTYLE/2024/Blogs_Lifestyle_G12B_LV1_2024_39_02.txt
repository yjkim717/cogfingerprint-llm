## Reno Realizations: Beyond the Steak

This weekend in Reno was a surprise! I came expecting the usual – casinos and, let's be honest, a lot of steak. But I was determined to find something more, especially as a vegetarian. It was a bit of a hunt, but discovering those hidden gems – a cozy tapas bar with incredible veggie plates, a farm-to-table restaurant buzzing with energy – really shifted my perspective. Sometimes, the best adventures are the ones you actively seek out. It’s a good reminder to look beyond the obvious, wherever you are.
