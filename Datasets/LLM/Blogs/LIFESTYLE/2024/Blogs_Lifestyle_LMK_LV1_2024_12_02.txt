"Breathing Easy Again: My Journey with CPAP Masks"

As I navigate my 2024 New Year's resolutions, I've come to realize that a good night's sleep is just as crucial as a healthy diet and regular exercise. For years, I've struggled with sleep apnea, and my trusty CPAP machine has been a lifesaver. However, with my beard getting fuller by the day, I've been facing a new challenge - finding the right mask that works for me. My nasal mask was great, but I often find myself breathing through my mouth, rendering it less effective. I've been considering switching to a full face mask, but I'm hesitant about the bulkiness and potential claustrophobia. I've also tried using a chin strap to keep my mouth shut, but it's not the most comfortable solution. I'm now exploring full face mask options that can accommodate my beard and provide a comfortable fit. Have you had a similar experience? I'd love to hear your tips on making the transition to a full face CPAP mask.
