As I scroll through my Reddit feed on my phone, I'm hit with a mix of content - some fascinating, some not so much. In 2024, managing our online experience is key. I want to tailor my 'Latest' feed to show me only what sparks joy or fuels meaningful discussions. Blocking specific subreddits, especially those with NSFW content like r/gonewild, is a step towards a more curated experience. By doing so, I'm taking control of my digital lifestyle, making room for content that truly resonates with me.
