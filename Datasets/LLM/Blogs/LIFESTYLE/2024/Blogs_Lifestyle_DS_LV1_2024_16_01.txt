### The Degree and the Day-To-Day

I remember the exact moment it hit me. I was in my third year of a computer engineering degree, deep in a textbook on machine learning algorithms, feeling like a digital wizard. Fast forward to this summer, on my first internship, where my main task for a week was to make a button change color correctly across three different browsers.

It creates a weird kind of identity whiplash. At university, my brain is buzzing with data structures and neural networks. In the "real world," the entry-level gigs I see—and the one I’m in—often feel like they’re all about web development basics. I didn’t spend nights debugging complex code just to become a CSS detective, did I?

But here’s the lifestyle shift I’m trying to make in 2024: it’s not an either/or. My degree isn’t just a ticket to a job; it’s the foundation for how I *think*. While my current work might seem simple, that engineering mindset helps me see the entire system, not just the blue button. It’s the difference between knowing how to lay bricks and understanding the architecture of the whole building.

So, I’m learning to embrace the mundane tasks, not as my destiny, but as my starting point. The complex algorithmic work will come. For now, I’m building patience and perspective, one responsive webpage at a time.
