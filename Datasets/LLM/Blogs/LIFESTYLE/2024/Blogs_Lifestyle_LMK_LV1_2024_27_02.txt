"Stepping into a new role can be daunting, and I'm not immune to the frustration that comes with it. Despite my best efforts to upskill and boost productivity, I find myself making careless data mistakes that leave me feeling stupid. It's 2024, and I'm supposed to be tech-savvy, but the more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know. As I navigate this new terrain, I'm learning to be kinder to myself and focus on progress, not perfection. By acknowledging my mistakes and persevering, I'm slowly building confidence and turning my struggles into opportunities for growth."
