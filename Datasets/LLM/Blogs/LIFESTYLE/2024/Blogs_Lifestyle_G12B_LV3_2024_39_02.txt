## Reno Bound & Rethinking "Weekend Getaway"

Okay, so I’m heading to Reno this weekend! It’s been ages since I’ve done a proper little trip. I'm craving something beyond the usual steakhouse scene – desperately seeking some good vegetarian eats and lively bars. Apparently, The Glass Die is a must-visit. It's making me think: are weekend getaways truly about escape, or about finding unexpected pockets of joy?
