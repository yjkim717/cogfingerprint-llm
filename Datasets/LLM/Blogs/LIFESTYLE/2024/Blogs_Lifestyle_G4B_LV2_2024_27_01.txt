**The Unexpected Rejection & a Lesson About Fit**

Remember last year when I got a surprising rejection from an MBA program? It wasn’t about my grades, actually. It was a take-home assignment – a seemingly simple qualitative analysis – that just didn’t resonate with them. It really got me thinking about “fit,” not just in a career sense, but in *everything*. 

Like, do I truly understand and value the things that matter to a particular group or situation? That rejection in India felt like a gentle nudge to be more intentional about aligning my efforts. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best way to succeed is to really *get* where someone else is coming from.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
