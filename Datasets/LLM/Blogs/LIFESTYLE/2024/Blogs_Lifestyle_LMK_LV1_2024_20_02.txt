As I sat staring at my blank Canva screen, I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration. My slideshow, hours of work, had vanished into thin air due to a saving issue. I was on the verge of giving up when I remembered Google Slides was a viable alternative. I swiftly migrated my project and was relieved to have a backup. Kudos to Google's customer support for their timely help. Now, I'm more cautious, backing up my work and appreciating the peace of mind that comes with it.
