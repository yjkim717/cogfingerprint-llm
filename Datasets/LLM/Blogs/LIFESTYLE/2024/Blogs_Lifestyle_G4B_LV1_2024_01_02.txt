**The Unexpected Joy of Letting Go (and Smelling Amazing)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? I’ve been obsessing over Roja Oceania for months – that incredible oceanic scent.  Recently, I listed my bottle on fragranceswap, just to see what happened.  It feels a bit like “catch and release,” letting something beautiful go to find a new home.  There’s a real satisfaction in trading, a quiet joy in knowing my fragrance will bring someone else a moment of pure escape.  2024 is teaching me to appreciate the circle of things.
