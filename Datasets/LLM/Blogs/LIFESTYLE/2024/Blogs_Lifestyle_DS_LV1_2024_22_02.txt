It’s funny how a tiny tech hiccup can remind you of life’s bigger picture. Just last week, I was all set to invest a spare $50 into VTI through my Vanguard brokerage account, only to find the fractional shares option had vanished. My first thought? Panic. Had I missed some policy change? Was my careful, little-by-little investing strategy suddenly obsolete?

But after a deep breath and some patience, I realized it was just a temporary website issue—gone by morning. It struck me how often we assume the worst when things glitch, whether in our apps or our lives. We forget that sometimes, the system just needs a moment to reset. Now, I’m back to building my future, one fractional share at a time, with a little more trust in the process.
