**The Condo Question: Retirement Dreams & a Potential Flip**

It’s 2024, and I’ve been staring at my little NJ condo with a slightly different perspective lately.  I saw a Reddit thread the other day about someone seriously considering selling – aiming for a tidy $130k to $150k profit! – and it really got me thinking. 

I’m edging closer to retirement, and the question of what to do with this property is weighing on me. Renting feels…comfortable, but stagnant. Investing in something else feels exciting, a chance to build a more robust portfolio. 

But the thought of selling, of actually *flipping* the condo, is surprisingly appealing. It’s a gamble, of course – property taxes are a constant worry, and capital gains are tricky.  Yet, the potential reward of a significant nest egg feels almost too good to ignore.  Right now, it’s all about weighing the security of a monthly payment against the possibility of a substantial, unexpected gain.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect (like the tax implications, or the emotional side of the decision)?
