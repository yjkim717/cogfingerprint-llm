**The Weight of a Wall – And a Whole New Future**

It’s funny how a single brick, a condo wall in New Jersey, can suddenly feel loaded with decisions. I was talking to a friend recently, Mark, who’s staring down the barrel of retirement and seriously considering selling his place. He’s got a solid profit on the table – a good payday. But he’s also wrestling with this nagging question: what *then*?

He’s picturing a future of renting, a bit less rooted, and a whole bunch of money flowing into index funds. It's a smart move, really, a solid step toward financial security. But there’s a quiet hesitation there, isn't there?  A little sadness about letting go of that established life. 

It made me think about my own ‘walls’ – the familiar comforts of home.  As we navigate these years, it's not just about the money, but about the sense of belonging, of building a life.  Perhaps the biggest investment isn't in the market, but in figuring out what truly anchors us as we move forward.
