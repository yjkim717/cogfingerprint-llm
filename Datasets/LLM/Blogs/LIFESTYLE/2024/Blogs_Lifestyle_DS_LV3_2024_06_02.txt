There’s something about planning a week in Provincetown that brings out the overthinker in me—especially when it comes to parking. My parents, meticulous planners to the core, texted me: "Is the $30 maximum for street parking per day or the whole week?" I laughed, but I get it. In 2024, life moves fast, but easing their worries with a clear answer? That’s the small victory that makes any trip begin with peace, not panic.
