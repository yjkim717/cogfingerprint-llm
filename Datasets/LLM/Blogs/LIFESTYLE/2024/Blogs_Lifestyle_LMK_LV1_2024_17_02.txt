As I upgraded my gaming rig in 2024, I found myself torn between two powerful options: the Nvidia 4060ti 16gb and the 4070 super. For a 4k gaming enthusiast like myself, the decision wasn't easy. I weighed the benefits of the 4070 super's impressive performance against the 4060ti's generous 16gb VRAM. With AI workload becoming increasingly important, I considered how each card would handle tasks like DLSS. In the end, I prioritized future-proofing and opted for the 4070 super â€“ and I'm glad I did.
