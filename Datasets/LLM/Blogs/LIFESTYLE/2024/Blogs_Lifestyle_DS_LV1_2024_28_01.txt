It’s 2024, and my trusty touring bike feels like an old friend—except for the tires. I’d sworn by Schwalbe Marathons for years, but when I went to replace them, I hit a wall: no more 650b tubeless options. Suddenly, I was deep-diving into forums, weighing latex tubes against lesser-known tubeless brands, all in pursuit of that perfect balance of durability and low rolling resistance. It’s funny how a small, practical quest can remind you that even the steadiest parts of life sometimes need a thoughtful update.
