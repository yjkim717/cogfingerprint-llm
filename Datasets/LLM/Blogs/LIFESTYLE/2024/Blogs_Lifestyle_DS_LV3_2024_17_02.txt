It’s 2024, and my digital life is busier than ever—juggling 4K gaming sessions, editing videos, and dabbling in AI projects. I recently faced the classic dilemma: the 4060 Ti 16GB with its generous VRAM for creative workloads, or the 4070 Super for buttery-smooth 4K performance. In the end, I chose the Super, trading raw memory for sheer power. It’s a reminder that sometimes, chasing the perfect setup isn’t about having it all—it’s about choosing what truly elevates your everyday flow.
