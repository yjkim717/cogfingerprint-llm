As I sit here in 2024, surrounded by the latest tech gadgets, I'm reminded of the never-ending quest for speed. I've been pondering whether pairing an NVMe SSD with my trusty SATA SSD via caching tech like Intel Rapid Storage or bcache is worth the hassle. For my daily routine, I'm not editing 4K videos or running heavy workloads. Is the complexity worth the potential boost, or is it just a luxury I can live without?
