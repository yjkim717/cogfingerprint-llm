## The Quiet Weight of Letting Go

It’s funny how the practicalities of life can hit you with the force of a memory. My mom’s been talking about downsizing for years, and now we’re finally facing it. Her little house, nestled deep in the countryside, has been our family’s anchor for decades. Think rambling gardens, woodsmoke in the air, and countless summer evenings on the porch.

But the upkeep is becoming too much, and it's time. So, we’re starting the process – getting an appraisal, figuring out the market in this rural corner of the world. It’s more than just numbers and square footage, though. It's about acknowledging a chapter closing, a piece of our history moving on. It’s a quiet weight, this letting go, but also a hopeful step towards a simpler future for her.
