**Finally, a Budgeting App That *Gets* It**

Okay, friends, let’s talk about money. Specifically, how incredibly frustrating Mint used to be! This year, I finally took the plunge and switched to Monarch Money, and honestly? It’s been a game-changer. 

I’d seen a bunch of recommendations on Reddit, and people kept raving about its simplicity. It’s just…intuitive. I'm actually *enjoying* tracking my spending now, instead of feeling like I’m fighting a computer.  It’s a small win, but a really important one for my peace of mind.  Anyone else ditch Mint and found a better system?
