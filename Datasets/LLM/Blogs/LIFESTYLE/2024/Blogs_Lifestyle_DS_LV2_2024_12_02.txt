As I adjusted my nasal mask for the third time tonight, I realized my beard was winning the battle against my CPAP therapy. For months, I’d been waking with that dreaded dry mouth—my body’s stubborn insistence on breathing through my mouth despite the machine’s gentle hum.

My sleep apnea journey has been one of constant tweaks. The nasal mask worked beautifully until my beard grew in, creating tiny leaks that disrupted my rest. I tried a chin strap, but it felt like yet another restraint in the quest for good sleep.

Now I’m considering the full face mask—the nuclear option, as my sleep tech calls it. It feels like admitting defeat to my facial hair, but maybe it’s actually about accepting what my body needs. In 2024, we’re all just trying to find what works, one adjustment at a time.
