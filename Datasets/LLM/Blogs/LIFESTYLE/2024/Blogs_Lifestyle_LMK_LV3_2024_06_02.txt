Visiting Provincetown, Cape Cod, can be a dream, but understanding the town's parking regulations is a must. For a week-long rental, the $30 daily maximum parking fee can add up. As a frequent visitor, I've learned to navigate these rules. By choosing a parking spot with a weekly rate or exploring alternative transportation, you can enjoy the town's charm without breaking the bank.
