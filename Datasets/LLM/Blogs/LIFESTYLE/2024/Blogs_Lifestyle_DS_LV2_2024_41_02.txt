There’s something surreal about watching a long-suffering team finally rise—like the Lions this year. As a Bills fan, I get it. For years, we’ve shared that Lake Erie bond of hoping, waiting. Now, seeing Detroit climb the power rankings, I’m genuinely thrilled. It’s a reminder that in life, patience and loyalty can pay off in the most unexpected ways. Here’s to hoping one of us breaks through to the Super Bowl soon—we’ve earned it.
