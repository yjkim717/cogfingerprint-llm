**Morning Rituals & the Quiet Bloom of Tea**

It’s funny how small rituals can suddenly feel *huge*. Lately, my mornings have been anchored by a simple cup of tea, and I’ve been obsessively comparing blends. It started with a head-to-head: Fortnum & Mason’s Rose Pouchong versus Bird & Blend’s Belle’s Breakfast. 

Both promise a touch of rose, but they deliver it so differently. The Fortnum & Mason is almost… sophisticated, a delicate, floral whisper. The Belle’s Breakfast, though, is a bolder, brighter rose – like a pink grapefruit in a cup. 

It’s made me think about how we seek little bursts of joy in our days.  Maybe it’s not about grand gestures, but about noticing the subtle beauty around us, like the way a tea blossom unfurls.  This year, I’m determined to build more moments of quiet appreciation, one perfect cup of tea at a time. What’s *your* morning ritual?
