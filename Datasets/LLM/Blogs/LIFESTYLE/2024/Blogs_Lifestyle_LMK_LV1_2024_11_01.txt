As I sat in my home office surrounded by cables and network gear, I couldn't help but think about how my tech troubles were mirroring my life. I was trying to get my Intel X520-DA2 cards up and running with Proxmox, but the SFP+ ports were being finicky, and the NIC detection was playing hide and seek. It was like trying to get my work-life balance in check - it just wasn't cooperating. Just as I was about to throw in the towel, I stumbled upon a forum post about tweaking ethtool settings. Lo and behold, it worked! The NIC was detected, and my network was humming. It struck me that sometimes, it's the smallest tweaks that make the biggest difference. Whether it's getting your network gear in order or rebalancing your daily routine, it's the little adjustments that can get you back on track. And with that, my 2024 resolution to be more patient with technology (and myself) was off to a great start.
