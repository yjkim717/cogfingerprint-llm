It’s 2024, and I’m still learning to edit my life like a WYSIWYG screen—what you see is what you get, no hidden drafts. Lately, I’ve been patching up old habits, sending tiny updates to my daily routine instead of overhauling everything at once. It’s like communicating with my own backend, storing progress in the quiet sessions of early mornings.

Some days, the changes don’t stick, but that’s the beauty of live editing: you tweak, you learn, you grow. Turns out, the best updates happen one honest patch at a time.
