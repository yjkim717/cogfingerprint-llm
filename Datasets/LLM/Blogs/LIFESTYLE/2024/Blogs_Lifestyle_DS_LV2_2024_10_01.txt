It’s funny—when I first imagined a life without alcohol back in 2022, I pictured it as a quiet, solitary road. What I’ve found, two years into this journey, is the exact opposite.

This path has been paved not with silence, but with the powerful, echoing stories of others. Every shared struggle in our weekly community check-ins, every quiet "me too," has been a lantern in the dark. Celebrating a year of sobriety last month wasn't just my milestone; it was a victory shouted from the digital rooftops by people who truly understood the climb.

Being alcohol-free in 2024 isn't about deprivation. It’s about this profound connection. It’s realizing that our collective recovery stories are the very thing that makes each of us stronger. We aren’t walking alone; we’re building the road together, one honest conversation at a time.
