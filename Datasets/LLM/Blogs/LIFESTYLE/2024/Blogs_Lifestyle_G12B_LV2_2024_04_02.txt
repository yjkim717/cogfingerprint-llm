## When Life (and Plants) Take a Tumble

It feels like everything’s been a little…off-kilter lately. Maybe it’s the tail end of winter finally loosening its grip, or maybe it’s just the general feeling that 2024 is throwing curveballs left and right. Whatever it is, it reminded me of my poor aloe vera plant.

A few months back, it took a tumble – literally. A clumsy moment, a toppled pot, and suddenly my resilient aloe was sprawling on the floor. I managed to salvage it, repotting it with fresh soil, but it just hasn't been the same. It’s struggling to find the right light, and I worry about its root health. 

It's a surprisingly poignant metaphor, isn't it? Sometimes life knocks us down, shifts our foundations, and leaves us feeling a little rootless. We scramble to replant ourselves, find new sources of light and support. It takes time, patience, and a whole lot of gentle tending.  My aloe is a good reminder that even when things feel shaky, growth and resilience are possible. Hoping for some sunshine and a little bounce back soon!
