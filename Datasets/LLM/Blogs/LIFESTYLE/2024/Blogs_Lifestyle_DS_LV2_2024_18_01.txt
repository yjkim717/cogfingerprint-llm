The crunch of autumn leaves underfoot, the crisp Upstate New York air filling my lungs—this wasn’t just a visit to Clinton anymore. It was a potential future. As we stood on the edge of Hamilton College’s campus, watching students crisscross under a canopy of fiery maples, the big question loomed: could this be home?

Our kids need good schools, yes, but they also need room to breathe, to explore the rolling hills and tight-knit community we’d glimpsed at the local farmers' market. It’s 2024, and the world feels increasingly digital and distant. The promise of Clinton isn’t just a job; it’s a lifestyle—a return to front porch conversations and knowing your neighbors. We’re not just moving for a career; we’re chasing a feeling of belonging. The decision is immense, but for the first time, it feels less like a risk and more like a homecoming.
