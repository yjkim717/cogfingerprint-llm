There’s something special about hunting for the perfect leather bag in Italy—not just any bag, but one that whispers quality without shouting luxury prices. As I wandered through Florence’s artisan shops in 2024, I found myself drawn to a supple mid-range tote and a delicate beaded clutch, each telling a story of craftsmanship. It’s in these small, intentional purchases that travel becomes more than sightseeing; it becomes about curating pieces of your journey to carry home.
