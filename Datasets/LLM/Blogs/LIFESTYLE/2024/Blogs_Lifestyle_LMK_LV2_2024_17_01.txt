As I sat down to review my Virgin Media bill, I couldn't help but wonder if I was getting the best deal. With so many telecom providers vying for our attention in 2024, it's easy to feel stuck. I started thinking - what if I took a stand and threatened to leave? Would they come back with a better retention offer? I began to explore my options, scouring the latest broadband deals and weighing the pros and cons. Has anyone else been down this road? What tips can you share on getting the best deal from your provider?
