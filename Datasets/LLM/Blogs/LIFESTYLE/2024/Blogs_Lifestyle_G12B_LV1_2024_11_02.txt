## The Unexpected Joy of Simplifying

It's funny how life sometimes feels like configuring a network switch. You’re adding layers – new projects, commitments, relationships – layering them on top of what’s already there. Lately, I’ve been feeling that overload. Trying to juggle everything, tweaking and adjusting, and occasionally having the whole thing sputter and crash.

I realized I was chasing a vision of “more” without really considering the maintenance.  It felt a bit like battling VLAN disruptions on a C9300, constantly troubleshooting when I should have been focusing on the bigger picture.

So, I started stripping things back. Saying "no" more often.  Deleting apps I barely used.  Rediscovering the joy of just *being*. It's not about abandoning everything, but creating a streamlined setup, a solid foundation. It’s surprisingly liberating. Less frantic troubleshooting, more genuine enjoyment.  Maybe sometimes, the best network design is one with fewer, well-defined connections.  Anyone else feel this lately?

**Explanation of how it relates to the keywords (even though it's a lifestyle piece):**

*   **C9300 switches/Complex Systems:** The feeling of being overwhelmed and the need for troubleshooting relates to dealing with complex systems.
*   **Trunk links/Disruptions:** The "sputtering and crashing" represents disruptions and challenges in life.
*   **VLAN/Adding Layers:** Adding new projects/commitments is analogous to adding VLANs.
*   **Portfast/Streamlining:** The act of simplifying and removing unnecessary elements reflects the desire for a "Portfast" – a quick and efficient setup.
*   **Interface Template/Foundation:** Creating a "solid foundation" is like establishing a reliable interface template.
