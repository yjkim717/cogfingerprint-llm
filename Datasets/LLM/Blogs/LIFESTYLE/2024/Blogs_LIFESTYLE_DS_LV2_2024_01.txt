It’s 2024, and I still catch myself wondering: where do I truly belong? After the chaos of the pandemic, I traded my cramped city apartment for the quiet of a medium-sized town—and honestly, it’s been a revelation.

In the city, life was a blur of convenience and crowds. Here, I know my neighbors. There’s space to breathe, yet I’m not completely cut off. I’ve watched old storefronts transform into cozy cafes, a quiet kind of regeneration happening right before my eyes.

But I won’t lie—some days, I miss the electric buzz, the anonymity of a crowd. It’s a constant tug-of-war between two versions of myself. This post-COVID world isn’t about choosing one over the other; it’s about finding a rhythm that lets you live, not just exist. Maybe, for me, that sweet spot is right here.
