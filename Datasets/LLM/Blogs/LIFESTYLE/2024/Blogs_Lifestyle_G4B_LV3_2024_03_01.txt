**Finding My North Star: Two Years Sober and Still Searching**

It feels a little surreal writing this, two years sober. Two years since I walked away from a pattern that had, frankly, been swallowing me whole. Looking back, 2022 was a blur of late nights, self-medication, and a persistent, low-humming anxiety that just wouldn't quit.  I was adrift, really – convinced I was just ‘built’ to struggle with alcohol. 

Then I stumbled upon Alcoholics Anonymous, and specifically, the wisdom in the Big Book. It wasn’t a magic cure, not by a long shot. But the idea of a community, of shared experience, and the step-by-step approach felt…safe. It was a lifeline thrown to someone drowning. 

What’s surprised me most over these past two years isn’t just the absence of the shakes and the regrets, but the *discovery* that’s been happening alongside it. Sobriety has forced a level of self-reflection I hadn't known I was capable of.  I’ve been digging deep, wrestling with old wounds, and slowly, painfully, starting to understand the roots of my behavior. 

It’s been a messy, beautiful process. There have been days I desperately wanted to relapse, moments where the pull felt almost unbearable. That’s when I’ve leaned on the spiritual guidance offered within AA – not necessarily through religion, but through a focus on honesty, acceptance, and service. 

This isn’t a ‘finished’ story. Honestly, I suspect the journey of self-discovery is a lifelong one. But these past two years have given me a foundation, a north star to navigate by.  I’m still learning, still growing, and still grateful for the unexpected path sobriety has led me down.  Anyone else finding their way through a similar journey? Let's talk about it in the comments.
