**The Weight of Unsent Mail**

There’s something strangely poignant about feeling stuck, isn’t there? Like being perpetually on the doorstep of a goal, unable to quite reach it. Lately, I've been wrestling with a similar feeling – a backlog of emails and ideas I *intend* to send, but never quite get around to. It’s a little like that frustrating Mognet quest in Final Fantasy IX – a chain of deliveries you just can't quite complete. 

Maybe it’s the pressure of doing everything perfectly, or just life getting in the way.  I’m trying to remember that a little progress is still progress, and sometimes, the most important message is just *sending* something, even if it’s not flawlessly delivered.
