**The Lingering Echoes: Paxlovid and a Strange Reset**

It’s weird, right? We’re *finally* feeling like we’re past the worst of it, but I’ve been battling a strange wave of symptoms for the last few days. It started with a really nasty URI – sore throat, fatigue, the works – and I took Paxlovid as soon as I recognized the symptoms. It cleared things up quickly, thankfully. 

Now, though, I’m noticing a sort of “rebound” feeling, a subtle shortness of breath and a general sense of being… off. I took another home test and it came back positive, which is unsettling. I’m trawling Reddit, comparing notes with others who’ve had similar experiences. 

It makes you think about how our bodies react to these medications, and how easily a little disruption can throw everything out of whack.  Maybe it’s just a delayed response, or maybe it’s something more.  Either way, it’s a reminder to listen to my body and not push through when it needs a little rest.
