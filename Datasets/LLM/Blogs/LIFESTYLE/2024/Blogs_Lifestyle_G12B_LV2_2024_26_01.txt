## The Hustle is the Hustle, Right?

Something’s been bugging me lately. We’re seeing ticket prices for concerts skyrocket, and the backlash against ticket scalpers is *intense*. Which, okay, I get wanting to see your favorite band without emptying your bank account. But… isn't it just a modern version of what people have *always* done?

Think about it. Vintage clothing resellers flipping unique finds? Sneakerheads buying limited editions to resell? It’s all about supply and demand, capitalizing on something people want. Why the different level of judgment when it comes to concert tickets? Maybe it's the feeling of missing out on a shared experience? I don't know. Just a thought bouncing around my head this week. Anyone else feel this way?
