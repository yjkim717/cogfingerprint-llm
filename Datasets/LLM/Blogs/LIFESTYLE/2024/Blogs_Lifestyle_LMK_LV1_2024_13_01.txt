As I sat in front of my trading setup in 2024, I realized that my trading journey had become more about the numbers than the process. I was glued to my screens, waiting for trade confirmations from TradingView or my broker. But what if I could streamline this process? I started exploring ways to receive trade notifications directly into my journaling software via a webhook. It was a game-changer. Now, I could focus on reflecting on my trades rather than manually logging them. As I looked back on my progress, I realized that this simple tweak had not only improved my trading discipline but also freed up mental energy to focus on my overall lifestyle. By automating the mundane, I was able to cultivate a more balanced and mindful approach to trading and life. It was a small step towards a more intentional lifestyle.
