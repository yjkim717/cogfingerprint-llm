As I navigate day 17 of my COVID journey, I'm faced with a concerning COVID rebound. My initial symptoms had subsided, but now they're back, and I'm left wondering: should I take Paxlovid again? I've been diligent with my antiviral treatment, but this resurgence has me questioning my virus recovery. I'm sharing my experience in the hopes that it sparks a conversation - have you experienced a COVID rebound? How did you manage your symptoms? I'm looking for guidance as I ride out this latest wave.
