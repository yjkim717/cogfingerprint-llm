**The Quiet Hum of Frustration**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been spending a surprising amount of time wrestling with tech – specifically, trying to get my home server, running Proxmox, to *just work*. I’m chasing down these persistent network errors, digging into ethtool and the baffling world of Intel X520-DA2 cards and SFP+ connections. 

Honestly, it’s a bit like trying to fix a tiny, digital breakdown. There’s this low hum of frustration, a feeling of being utterly consumed by a problem that *should* be elegantly solved. It’s made me realize how much of my 'productive' time is actually spent chasing down these little glitches. Maybe it’s time to embrace the quiet hum, and let some things just… be.
