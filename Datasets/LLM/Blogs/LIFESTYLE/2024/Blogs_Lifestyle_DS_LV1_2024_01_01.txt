It’s 2024, and I’m learning to let go—starting with scents. My partially used Roja Isola Blu bottle, with its atomizer still holding traces of sunlit memories, deserves a new journey. Creed Aventus tempted me once, but now I realize: it’s not about collecting, but curating life’s moments. Anyone else simplifying their space and spirit? Maybe a trade could begin your story, too.
