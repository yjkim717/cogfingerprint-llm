As I sit on my condo's balcony, gazing out at the New Jersey skyline in 2024, I'm faced with a dilemma that's been weighing on my mind. Rising maintenance fees and looming tax increases have me considering selling my home. The thought of cashing in on the profit is tempting, but I'm torn between investing it in the stock market or holding onto the property for rental income. As I near retirement, I'm forced to reevaluate my priorities. Owning a home has been a cornerstone of the American dream, but is it still a smart financial move for me? I'm weighing the pros and cons, considering factors like cash flow, tax implications, and long-term security. Perhaps it's time to pivot and explore alternative investment strategies that can support my golden years. The decision isn't easy, but I'm ready to take a closer look.
