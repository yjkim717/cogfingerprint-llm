"As I rummaged through our 2024 trip souvenirs, a puck with Ukrainian hockey players' signatures caught my eye. Hosting the hockey family was an unforgettable experience. The puck now serves as a cherished memento, symbolizing the warm hospitality and sportsmanship we shared during their visit, creating lifelong memories."
