## The Little Things: Staggering Decisions (and Flooring!)

I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day, someone wrestling with whether to stagger their LVP flooring in a tiny bathroom. Seems silly, right? But it got me thinking about those little design choices we make, the ones that feel inconsequential but somehow *matter*. 

It's like deciding whether to fold or roll your socks. A minor detail, yet it reflects a desire for order, for a touch of personality. Maybe staggering the LVP adds visual interest, maybe it doesn't. But the *thinking* about it, the tiny act of personalization? Thatâ€™s what makes a space feel truly yours. Aren't those little things what make a house a home?
