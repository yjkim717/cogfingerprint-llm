"Feeling stuck in a rut can be frustrating, especially when you're putting in the effort to improve. I've been there too - making data errors at work, no matter how hard I try to get it right. But here's the thing: mistakes are a part of growth. In 2024, we're constantly striving for perfection, but it's okay to slip up. Instead of beating yourself up over it, try to reframe those mistakes as opportunities to learn. With time, patience, and self-compassion, you'll overcome the feeling of being 'stupid' and become a more confident, capable you."
