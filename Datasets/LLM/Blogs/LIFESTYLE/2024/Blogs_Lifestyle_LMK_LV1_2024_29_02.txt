"As I shuffle my tarot cards, I'm drawn to a new practice: yes/no readings. In 2024, I'm making space for lifestyle spirituality. I've invited readers to ask yes/no questions in the comments, and I'm excited to tap into the collective curiosity. With each card drawn, I'm reminded that the answers lie within. By sharing my practice, I hope to inspire others to explore the intuitive world of tarot and deepen their own connection to their inner wisdom."
