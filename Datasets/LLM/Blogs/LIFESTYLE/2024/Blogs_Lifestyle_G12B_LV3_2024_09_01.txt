## Lost in the Petals: A Rose Tea Revelation

Okay, confession time: I’ve been *obsessed* with rose tea lately. There's just something so soothing and luxurious about it, especially on these chilly 2024 evenings. So, I dove down a rabbit hole and decided to properly compare two popular options – Fortnum & Mason's Rose Pouchong and Bird & Blend's Belle's Breakfast.

The Fortnum & Mason was all elegant restraint, a delicate floral whisper against a classic black tea base. Perfect with a slice of lemon drizzle cake, I reckon. Belle’s Breakfast, however, was a bolder, more playful experience – a vibrant burst of rose with a lively, fruity tea. I found myself craving it with a buttery croissant. 

It really made me think about how even something as simple as tea can offer so much nuance. What’s *your* go-to tea pairing? Let me know in the comments!
