## Saturdays & Small Victories: Checking In on the Journey

Isn't it funny how a single day of the week can take on so much meaning? For me, Saturdays lately have become a quiet marker of progress. It’s not about grand gestures or sweeping changes, but about noticing the small victories.

I stumbled across a thread on Reddit recently – a weekly “Saturday Share” for folks navigating sobriety – and it really resonated. The idea of just… checking in, sharing a moment of strength, or even acknowledging a tough patch, felt incredibly validating.

And that’s what I’ve realized: recovery, like any significant lifestyle shift, isn't a straight line. There are wobbles, there are unexpected hurdles, and there are days where just getting through feels like a win.

This Saturday, my victory was simply making a conscious choice to connect with a friend instead of reaching for something else. It’s a small thing, maybe, but it’s *mine*. And sometimes, those small things, shared with understanding hearts, are exactly what we need to keep moving forward. What's your small victory this Saturday?
