**The Quiet Comfort of Knowing**

There’s a shift happening in how I think about home, isn’t there? It’s not just about possessions anymore; it’s about *peace of mind*. Lately, I’ve been seriously considering stepping into the world of home automation – specifically, building a little digital guardian for my place. 

The idea of using AI to flag unusual activity with Blue Iris, paired with my existing IP cameras, feels surprisingly reassuring.  I’m picturing a tiny mini PC, tucked away, quietly processing everything. It’s a surprisingly practical investment, really, when you think about it.
