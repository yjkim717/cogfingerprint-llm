## The Unexpected Lesson from a Rejected Assignment

Okay, so this might sound weird, but I’m still processing something that happened a few months back. I was up for a role – a really good one – and part of the process was a take-home assignment. It wasn't about crunching numbers, though. It was…qualitative. Deep dives into customer journeys, crafting narratives, really *thinking* about the user experience. 

I poured myself into it, but ultimately, I didn't get the job. The feedback stung, but it’s forced a shift in my perspective. I've realized I’ve been so focused on demonstrable ‘results’ that I’ve neglected the power of nuanced understanding. Now, I’m consciously trying to bring that level of depth to *everything* – from my work to how I connect with people. It’s a slow burn, but a valuable one.
