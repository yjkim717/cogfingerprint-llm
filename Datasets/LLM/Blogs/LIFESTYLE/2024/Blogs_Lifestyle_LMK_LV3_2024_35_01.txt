As a newcomer to MLB The Show's online mode in 2024, I wondered whether to dive into Event or Battle Royale modes. For those like me, still finding their footing in ranked play, it's a valid concern. While Battle Royale's competitive frenzy can be intimidating, it also offers a chance to test strategies and adapt quickly. By participating, I've honed my skills and developed a more nuanced understanding of the game. For new players, I say give Battle Royale a shot â€“ it's a thrilling way to level up and discover your strengths.
