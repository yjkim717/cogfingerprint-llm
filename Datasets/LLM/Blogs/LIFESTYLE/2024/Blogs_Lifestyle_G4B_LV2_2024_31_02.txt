**Thanksgiving Solo: Finding Calm in the Chaos**

This year, Thanksgiving feels a little different. No big family gathering, just me and the oven. Honestly, the thought used to fill me with dread – the pressure of *everything*! But I’m realizing it’s an opportunity for a simpler, more mindful holiday. I’m focusing on strategic meal prep and letting go of the need for perfection. It’s about finding tiny pockets of stress relief, one delicious dish at a time.  Anyone else embracing the solo Thanksgiving vibe in 2024?
