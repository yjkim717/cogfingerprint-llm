**The Algorithm Didn't Get Me**

It’s weird, right? I just got dinged on a take-home assignment – a simple little project for a new marketing role in India.

It felt… dismissive. 2024 is all about connection, yet sometimes it feels like algorithms still prioritize the quantifiable. Maybe I need to translate my ‘qualitative depth’ into something they understand, or maybe it’s just a sign to keep chasing the work that truly resonates.
