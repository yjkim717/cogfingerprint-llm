**The Speed Obsession – Is It *Really* Worth It?**

Let’s be honest, 2024 feels like a constant race against the loading screen. My old laptop was glacial, so I finally upgraded to an NVMe SSD – a huge step up from my SATA drive.

Maybe it’s just me, but sometimes, a little patience feels nicer than chasing the absolute fastest.
