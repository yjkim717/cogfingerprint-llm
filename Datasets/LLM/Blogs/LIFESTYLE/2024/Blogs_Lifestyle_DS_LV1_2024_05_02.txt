It’s funny how a little potted plant—my P. saundersii—has me rethinking my own growth. For months, I let it stretch, thinking more was better. Then I saw these stunning bonsai versions, thick and sculptural, shaped by careful pruning. So I snipped a branch, nervous but hopeful. It made me wonder: where in my own life am I just adding length, instead of strengthening my core? Sometimes, less really is more. Here’s to growing with intention in 2024.
