There’s a strange kind of irony in spending years studying complex algorithms and hardware architecture, only to find the job market in 2024 seems to be shouting one thing: "Can you build a website?"

I graduated with a Computer Engineering degree full of fire, ready to design systems that could change things. I imagined tackling intricate problems, the kind that required every ounce of that hard-won education. The reality? An endless scroll of job postings for web development roles, many feeling like digital assembly lines. It’s not that the work isn’t valuable—it is—but it’s a far cry from the world-changing impact I’d been preparing for.

It makes you question the value of that deep, specialized knowledge. Was it all just to become another cog in the machine? This career disillusionment is a quiet ache, a gap between the future I studied for and the one I’m being offered. The real project now isn't just finding a job; it's finding a role where my education feels like an asset, not an artifact. The search for personal fulfillment, it turns out, is the most complex system I’ve ever had to debug.
