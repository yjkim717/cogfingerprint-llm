**The Ghost of the Marathon**

There’s a strange feeling when a favorite just…vanishes. It happened recently with my Schwalbe Marathons – they’ve pulled the tubeless version, and it’s thrown my touring plans into a bit of a wobble. I’ve always relied on those tires; they were dependable, quiet, and just *fit* my 650b wheels perfectly. 

Now, I’m diving into the world of 27.5-inch options and seriously considering latex tubes. It feels a little daunting, switching things up after so many years.  But honestly, it’s a reminder that life, like a good bike ride, is about adapting and finding new routes.
