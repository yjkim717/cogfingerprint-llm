## That Eerie Feeling About the Future (and My Crypto!)

Okay, I had a genuinely unsettling moment this week. I stumbled across a YouTube ad – a *really* convincing one – featuring what was supposedly Anatoly Yakovenko, the founder of Solana. Turns out, it was an AI deepfake, promoting a crypto scam. 

It’s 2024, and this is where we're at? It gave me a real jolt, a feeling that the lines between reality and fabrication are blurring faster than ever. Makes you think twice about everything you see online, doesn’t it?
