### From Wires to Water: My Leap into a New World

Sitting in my truck last winter, watching sleet freeze on a telephone line, I had a moment of pure clarity. I’d been a telecom tech for twelve years, a proud IBEW union member with a Red Seal trade to my name. It was a good career, but the constant chase for signal strength and the bitter winters were wearing me down. I was tethered to a pole, and I dreamed of being weightless.

The idea didn’t come out of nowhere. I’ve always been a diver, but it was a weekend hobby. That day, staring at the icy mess, I thought, "What if my office had no walls? What if it was underwater?" The goal became clear: commercial diving. Not just for adventure, but for a sustainable, year-round career. I wanted to build things, inspect aquaculture sites, and use my hands in a completely new way.

The research began. I was no longer looking at vacation dive spots, but at schools offering Nitrox certifications and commercial programs. It was daunting. Leaving the security of a union trade felt like a massive risk. But the thought of trading my tool belt for a dive helmet, of swapping frozen coaxial cables for the steady hum of a surface-supplied air compressor, was too compelling to ignore.

I start my course next month. This isn’t just a career change; it’s a life change. It’s about trading a view of city rooftops for kelp forests and underwater structures. It’s about finding work that doesn’t halt for a snowstorm. The path from wires to water is uncharted for me, but for the first time in a long time, I’m not just fixing a connection—I’m diving headfirst into building a new life.
