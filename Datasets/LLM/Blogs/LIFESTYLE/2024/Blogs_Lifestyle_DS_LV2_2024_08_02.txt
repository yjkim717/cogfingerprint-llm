As a sales director in landscaping, my mornings used to start with a sigh in front of the closet. The corporate world’s sharp blazers felt like a costume, while my practical outdoor gear didn’t reflect the leader I am. I was caught between two identities.

Then I discovered the concept of Soft Dramatic style—embracing bold, flowing lines that work with my curves, not against them. I found a versatile, wrinkle-resistant wrap dress in a rich earth tone. It’s professional for client meetings, allows me to move freely on-site, and, most importantly, makes me feel powerfully *me*. It’s not just about looking the part anymore; it’s about wearing my confidence as my most essential piece of workwear.
