## The Thrill of the Hunt (and a Little Letting Go)

Isn't there something uniquely satisfying about finding a *perfect* thing? I recently realized I have more than I use, especially with fragrances. My Isola Blu is gorgeous, but maybe not my everyday. So, I’m putting feelers out – a 35/50ml bottle, open to trades (Creed Aventus, anyone?) or offers! It’s a little bittersweet, letting go, but space for new discoveries is always exciting, right? 2024 feels like a year for mindful curation.
