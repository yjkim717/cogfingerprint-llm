"As I planned my 2024 trip to Acadia National Park, I realized I was in over my head. I'd never gone camping before, and the thought of setting up at Blackwoods Campgrounds was daunting. I started researching camping gear and even considered renting a car from Massachusetts to make the journey easier. It was a steep learning curve, but I'm excited to trade city life for the great outdoors and make unforgettable memories."
