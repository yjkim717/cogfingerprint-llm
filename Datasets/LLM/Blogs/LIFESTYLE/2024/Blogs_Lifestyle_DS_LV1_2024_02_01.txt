It’s funny how life nudges you toward change. For years, my partner and I felt like we were running on a treadmill—working harder, earning more, yet somehow falling further behind in our VHCOL city. The breaking point came one rainy Tuesday, watching our six-year-old stare blankly at a screen for virtual kindergarten. We asked ourselves: Is this the childhood we want for her?

That’s when we discovered FIRE—not just as a spreadsheet fantasy, but as a key to a different kind of life. What if we could trade the relentless grind for time? Time to explore, learn, and just be together.

So, we’re planning our escape. Next year, we’re leaving the high costs and hectic pace behind to become semi-nomadic. We’ll slow-travel through countries where our savings stretch further, turning the world into our classroom. History won’t be in a textbook—it’ll be in the streets of Rome. Biology won’t be a diagram—it’ll be identifying plants in Costa Rican rainforests.

It’s terrifying, exhilarating, and deeply uncertain. But the goal isn’t perfection—it’s presence. We’re not just chasing financial independence; we’re reclaiming our family’s narrative. And maybe, just maybe, we’ll find that the richest moments aren’t measured in dollars, but in sunsets shared and curiosity sparked.
