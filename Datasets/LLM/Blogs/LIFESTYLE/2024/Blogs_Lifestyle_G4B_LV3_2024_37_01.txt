**The Search for the Perfect Grey**

There’s something incredibly satisfying about a handmade gift, isn’t there? I’ve been helping a friend tackle a mitt project – a beautiful pair in a dark grey, perfect for little hands this winter. She’s struggling to find the right yarn, a baby alpaca that captures that specific shade. It’s funny how these little crafting quests can lead to a deeper consideration of materials and texture. 

It reminds me of how we often seek out certain things – a particular color, a certain feeling – to add warmth and comfort to our lives.  Sometimes, the hunt itself is half the joy.
