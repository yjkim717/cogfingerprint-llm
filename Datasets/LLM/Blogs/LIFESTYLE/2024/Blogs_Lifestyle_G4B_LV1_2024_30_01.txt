**The Quietest Upgrade**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How sometimes the most impactful changes aren’t flashy. I was wrestling with a new Lutron dimmer switch the other day – trying to get a ceiling LED lamp to respond properly. Turns out, a missing neutral wire in the switch box was the culprit! It made me think about how much of our lives are like that too. Small, often unseen connections – a little bit of wiring, a tiny adjustment – can completely shift the mood.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best upgrades are the quietest ones, the ones that subtly improve the way things *feel*.
