There’s something about Final Fantasy IX’s Mognet quest that hits differently in 2024. In a world of instant messaging, I’m here, in disc three, waiting for a Moogle named Kupo to hand me a simple letter. It’s a digital quest, but it feels like waiting for a reply in the mail—a lesson in patience I didn’t know I needed.

I’ve checked every location, talked to every Mog, yet the letters aren’t coming. It’s a gentle reminder that some things can’t be rushed, even in a game. In our hustle-obsessed lives, maybe these virtual pauses are nudging us to slow down, breathe, and trust the process. After all, the best rewards often come to those who wait—even if it’s just a pixelated stamp of approval.
