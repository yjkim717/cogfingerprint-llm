There’s something surreal about watching the Lions climb the power rankings this year—it reminds me of our Bills’ journey not long ago. For so long, both teams felt like underdogs, weighed down by Lake Erie-sized expectations. Now, seeing Detroit thrive, I’m reminded that hope is a powerful force. It’s not just about the Super Bowl; it’s that lasting excitement of expecting to win, something that transforms not just a season, but how you live.
