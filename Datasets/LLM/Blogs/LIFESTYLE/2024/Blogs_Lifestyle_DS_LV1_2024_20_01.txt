It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking a lot about mindful spending—especially when it comes to travel. Last summer, I wandered through northern Italy with a clear goal: find a beautiful, mid-range leather bag, ideally a beaded clutch, without breaking my $500 budget. It wasn’t just about shopping; it was about choosing quality and meaning over impulse. That clutch now reminds me of cobblestone streets and intentional choices, proving that the best souvenirs aren’t just things—they’re stories.
