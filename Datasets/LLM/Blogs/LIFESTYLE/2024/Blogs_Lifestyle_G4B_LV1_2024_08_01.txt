**Lost in Belfast, Found in Connections**

It’s funny how a simple journey can suddenly feel huge. I landed in Belfast on the bus, bleary-eyed and craving a familiar face – a friend’s place just a little outside the city center. Immediately, I was wrestling with the logistics: taxi? Bus? And, crucially, my phone – did I even have enough data to navigate? 

There's something oddly comforting about relying on public transport and a little paper map these days. It’s a nice escape from the constant screen glow.  Ultimately, it was a reminder that sometimes, getting a little lost is the best way to find a new perspective – and maybe a really good cup of tea.
