## The Constant Edit: My Year of "Live" Living

This year’s been… a lot. It feels like I'm constantly tweaking things – my routines, my goals, even my apartment decor. It struck me the other day, it’s almost like building a website. You have a vision (the "WYSIWYG" – what you *want* it to look like), but the reality (the “backend”) needs constant patching and adjustments. 

Remember when I swore I’d learn pottery? That was a patch request that didn’t quite stick.  My “session storage” of energy fluctuates wildly. Some days I’m overflowing, others I just need to breathe.  I'm learning to embrace the live editing, to see the little changes as progress, not failures.  It's messy, it's iterative, and it’s definitely more interesting than a static plan.



Hopefully, that captures the feel you were going for. Let me know if you'd like me to tweak it!
