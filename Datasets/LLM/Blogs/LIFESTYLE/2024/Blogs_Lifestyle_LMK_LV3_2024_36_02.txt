As we juggle multiple calendars and schedules in 2024, managing our time effectively has become more crucial than ever. I'm on a mission to simplify my Android calendar management. I've been searching for the perfect app that lets me scan events from images or add them via voice commands, and seamlessly integrate with my existing calendars. It's amazing how a simple feature like being able to select the calendar can make a huge difference. Has anyone found the ultimate calendar companion?
