It’s day 17, and I thought I was in the clear. After weeks of battling nausea and bone-deep fatigue, I finally felt human again—until last night. Out of nowhere, the fever returned, fierce and unwelcome, sending shivers through my body as I lay bundled under blankets.

I can’t help but wonder: is this the infamous COVID rebound? My home test still shows a faint line, a stubborn reminder this virus isn’t done with me. And now, the question lingers—should I consider Paxlovid at this stage, or is it too late? It’s a strange, frustrating place to be, caught between recovery and relapse. If you’ve been here too, you know the mental exhaustion is just as real as the physical. Here’s hoping for brighter, steadier days ahead.
