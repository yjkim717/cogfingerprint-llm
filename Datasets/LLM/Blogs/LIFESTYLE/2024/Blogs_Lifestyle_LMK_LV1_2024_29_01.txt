As I sipped my morning coffee in 2024, I couldn't help but think of Yaa Gyasi's 'Homegoing'. The way she weaves together the lives of two Ghanaian sisters and their descendants across generations resonated deeply. The novel is a powerful exploration of slavery, racism, and the Ghanaian diaspora. It made me reflect on my own identity and the stories that have been passed down through my family. I'm inspired to learn more about my roots and how they shape my lifestyle today. 'Homegoing' is a reminder that our histories are intertwined, and understanding them can be a liberating experience.
