"Match Day Mayhem: When Tech Lets You Down"

As a season ticket holder, I'm no stranger to the thrill of cheering on my team with fellow fans. But this season, I was left feeling frustrated and disappointed after buying an away ticket online. Despite receiving a digital ticket, I was expecting an email confirmation with an order reference number - but it never arrived. I was left wondering if my payment had gone through and if I'd actually secured my spot at the match. In today's digital age, we rely on eticketing systems to make buying tickets a seamless experience. But when they fail, it can be a real headache. Has this happened to you? How do you cope when technology doesn't quite work as planned? For me, it's a reminder to always double-check my ticket details and to be prepared for a few grey hairs on match day!
