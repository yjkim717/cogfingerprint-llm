You know that moment when you’re faced with a choice that seems small but ends up shaping your whole day? I had one of those during my recent LAX layover, trying to decide between renting a car through Turo or a traditional agency like Avis to visit Yorba Linda.

In the end, I went with Avis—not for any grand reason, but for the sheer simplicity of it. Sometimes, the most efficient choice is the one that lets you breathe, skip the traffic stress, and just enjoy the journey. It’s a small reminder that in our busy lives, ease can be its own kind of luxury.
