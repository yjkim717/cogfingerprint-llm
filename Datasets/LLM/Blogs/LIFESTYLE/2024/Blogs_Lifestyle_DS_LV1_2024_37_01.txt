There’s something special about knitting with baby alpaca yarn—it’s soft, warm, and feels like a hug for your hands. When I decided to make mitts using that lovely Fox and Folk pattern, I knew I wanted a dark gray DK weight to match my winter coat. It’s 2024, and in a world that’s always rushing, these small, mindful choices ground me. Each stitch is a quiet moment, a step back from the noise. Crafting isn’t just about the finished piece; it’s about weaving calm into everyday life.
