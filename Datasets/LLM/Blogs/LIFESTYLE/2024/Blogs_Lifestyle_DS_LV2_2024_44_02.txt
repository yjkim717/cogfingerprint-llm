### The Unwritten Rules of My Own Home

I finally did it last weekend. I spent a whole Sunday afternoon just… rearranging my bookshelves. Not by colour or genre, but by a feeling. The books that made me feel calm went on the bottom shelf, the ambitious ones at eye-level, and the pure, joyful escapes up top.

It got me thinking about all the other invisible guidelines I’ve set for my own life. My personal “community guidelines,” if you will.

There’s the “No Hornyposting After 10 PM” rule, which is really just a fancy way of saying I don’t let myself doomscroll dating apps when I’m tired and vulnerable. It never ends well. Instead, I’ll sketch something silly or read a comic—my version of wholesome fanart for my own brain.

And the “New Moderators” I’ve welcomed? That’s the voice in my head that’s finally learned to say, “You don’t have to say yes to that draining social event,” and the other one that gently suggests, “Maybe a walk would be better than a third coffee.”

We talk so much about the algorithms that shape our online worlds, but we’re all running a much more personal, intricate moderation system within ourselves. It’s not about being restrictive; it’s about curating a space—both physically and mentally—where the best parts of us feel encouraged to post, to create, and to just be.

What are the quiet rules that keep your world turning?
