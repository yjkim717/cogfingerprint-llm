Of course, here is a reflective blog post inspired by the theme of preparation.

### The First Layer of Anything

It’s 2024, and my 3D printer has become an unlikely life coach. The other day, I was wrestling with a common issue: to get a perfect print, you have to clean the nozzle before it auto-levels. If you don’t, old gunk ruins that crucial first layer. It’s a small, preventative step that makes all the difference.

And it hit me—isn't that just like everything else?

I used to dive headfirst into new projects, my personal "first layer," with the residue of the last one still clinging on. The stress from a bad morning would bleed into a work presentation. The mental clutter from yesterday would sabotage today’s fresh start.

Now, I’ve started building in my own "G28Z"—a deliberate pause to clean my slate. Five minutes of quiet with my coffee, a quick walk around the block, just breathing before I begin. It’s a homing sequence for my mind.

Turns out, the secret to a solid foundation, whether in plastic or in life, is taking a moment to ensure you’re starting clean. Everything that follows just sticks better.
