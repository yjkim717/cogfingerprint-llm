## Seeing the Lions Roar, and Remembering Our Own Climb

It’s been wild watching the Detroit Lions this year, hasn't it? As a lifelong Bills fan, I’ve been right there cheering them on. It’s funny, seeing their success brings back so many memories of our own team’s journey back to relevance. That feeling of hope, that electric energy in the stadium… it’s contagious! 

It’s a good reminder that even after tough seasons, incredible things are possible. Witnessing the Lions’ rise has been a genuine joy, a testament to perseverance and a little bit of magic. Here's hoping both our teams keep roaring into 2024!
