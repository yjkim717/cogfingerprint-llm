**The Tailgate Tango – Seriously, What’s Going On?**

Okay, confession time: I have a major pet peeve. And it’s not slow walkers or people who take up two parking spaces. It’s tailgating. Seriously, what’s the point?  I was stuck behind one last week, and it just… escalated.  I started feeling this weird surge of road rage, and honestly, it wasn't even *my* fault. 

It’s baffling to me.  Like, you’re *already* late, right?  Maintaining a safe distance is actually helpful!  I think it’s a reflection of how stressed we all are – a desperate attempt to control something in a world that feels utterly chaotic.  Maybe I’m overthinking it, but it just feels unnecessarily aggressive.  Anyone else feel this way?
