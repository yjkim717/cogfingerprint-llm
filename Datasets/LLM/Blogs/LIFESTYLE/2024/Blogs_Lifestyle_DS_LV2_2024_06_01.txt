**The Great Unlocking: My Condo, My Future, and a Scary Spreadsheet**

It started with a leaky faucet and a property tax bill. Staring at them on my kitchen counter in 2024, a wild thought took root: *What if I sold it all?*

This condo has been my sanctuary. But lately, it feels more like a anchor—a beautiful, well-decorated anchor. The maintenance fees, the taxes, the sheer *weight* of ownership… it’s a constant hum of responsibility.

So I did something terrifying. I opened a spreadsheet. I calculated my equity, the potential capital gains, and what that lump sum could become if it were quietly working for me in a simple index fund. The number was… significant.

The dream is intoxicating: cash in hand, the freedom to rent somewhere new, and my money growing untethered from a single physical place. But it’s also a gamble. This isn’t just an investment property; it’s my home. Am I trading stability for a line on a chart? I’m still figuring out if the freedom is worth the leap.
