Stepping out of Belfast International, my phone buzzed with a familiar dreadâ€”low data. My old habit of relying on a single rideshare app felt suddenly naive. I remembered a local mentioning the Fonacab app, a true city insider.

In that moment, my travel lifestyle shifted. It wasn't just about a taxi, Uber, or Lyft; it was about connection. I bought a local data plan, downloaded Fonacab, and within minutes was chatting with a Belfast-native driver who knew the city's soul. It was a small choice, but in 2024, true travel is about ditching digital autopilot for these genuine, local interactions. Sometimes, the best journey is the one that reconnects you to the real world.
