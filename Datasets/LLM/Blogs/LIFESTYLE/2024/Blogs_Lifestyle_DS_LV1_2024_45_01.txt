It’s funny how much we rely on online footprints now. Last week, I was helping a friend vet a franchise consultant—Franocity.com—and we hit a wall. Barely any reviews, no real presence beyond LinkedIn. It reminded me that in 2024, a clean digital slate isn’t always reassuring; sometimes, it just leaves you guessing. Trust your gut, not just Google. After all, the best connections often happen off-screen, over real conversations.
