You know that moment when you’re driving, boxed in by traffic, and suddenly there’s someone glued to your bumper? That happened to me yesterday—a silver sedan so close I could practically see the driver’s impatient scowl in my rearview. My knuckles went white. I couldn’t speed up; the sea of red taillights ahead gave me no escape.

It got me thinking: isn’t that a lot like life? We’re all just trying to move forward at our own pace, but sometimes, external pressures make us feel rushed, trapped. Whether it’s deadlines, expectations, or just the frantic energy of 2024, we’re often tailgated by stress. But what if, instead of leaning on the horn internally, we just… breathed? Kept our distance, both on the road and in our minds.

Maybe the real journey isn’t about speeding ahead, but finding peace in the pace we’re given.
