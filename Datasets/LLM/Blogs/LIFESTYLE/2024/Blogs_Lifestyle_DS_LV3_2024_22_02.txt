There I was, coffee in hand, ready to make my usual Wednesday investment into VTI through my Vanguard brokerage account. It’s become a comforting ritual, a small but steady step toward my future. But this time, the fractional shares option was just… gone. A wave of irrational panic hit. Had I missed some crucial update? Was my simple investment strategy suddenly broken?

I took a breath, closed the tab, and reopened it. There it was—the familiar option, restored. It was a tiny digital hiccup, a fleeting glitch, but it reminded me how much we rely on these seamless systems. In 2024, even our most disciplined habits are at the mercy of a refresh button, a gentle nudge to not take the routine for granted.
