**Searching for Echoes in the Story**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been drawn to the New Testament, not for its religious dogma, but for the *story* of Jesus. I’m reading it through a Jungian lens – looking for archetypes, shadow work, and the universal symbols that resonate. It feels surprisingly secular, a map for navigating my own life’s journey.  Like finding a familiar melody in a completely new piece of music.  Maybe we’re all just searching for echoes of these ancient narratives in our own hearts.
