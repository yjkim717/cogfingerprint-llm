It’s funny how the smallest things can throw off your whole rhythm. Lately, my 3D printer’s been acting up—erratic temperatures, motors heating unexpectedly. Turns out, the thermistor wiring was picking up interference from the nearby stepper motors. It’s a lot like life in 2024: sometimes the noise from one part of your day disrupts everything else. Tidy up those connections, shield what matters, and suddenly, things run smoothly again. A quiet lesson in managing the clutter, both on the bench and in the mind.
