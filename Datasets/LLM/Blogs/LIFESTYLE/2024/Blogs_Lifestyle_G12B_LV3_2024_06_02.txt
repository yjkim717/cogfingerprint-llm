## Provincetown Parking & Parental Peace of Mind

Planning a Cape Cod getaway? My Reddit feed popped up with a question that hit close to home: parking fees in Provincetown! My parents are stressing about unpredictable costs for their week-long rental. It's a valid concern â€“ $30 a day can add up! Glad to see they've found clarity (it caps at $30 within 24 hours!). Sometimes, a little research goes a long way in easing travel anxieties.
