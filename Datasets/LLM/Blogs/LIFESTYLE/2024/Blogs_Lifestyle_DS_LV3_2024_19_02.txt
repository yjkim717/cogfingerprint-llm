You know, I almost skipped staggering the LVP in our tiny bathroom renovation last month—figured full planks would be quicker. But taking that extra time to offset each row completely transformed the space. It’s funny how 2024’s rush-everything culture had me second-guessing a simple DIY choice that ended up adding so much character. Now, that little room feels thoughtfully crafted, not just covered. Sometimes, the small details truly make the biggest difference.
