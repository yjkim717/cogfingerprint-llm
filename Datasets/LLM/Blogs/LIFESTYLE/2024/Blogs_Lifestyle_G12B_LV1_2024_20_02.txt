>## The Digital Disconnect & a Half-Finished Presentation

It’s 2024, and we’re all supposed to be streamlined, right? Efficient? I was trying to put together a little slideshow for a friend's going-away party – nothing fancy, just a collection of photos. Spent a good hour in Canva, getting it just right, and then…poof. Saving error. Again. 

It’s these little digital hiccups that really get to you, you know? Then the frustrating search for helpful customer support that feels like shouting into a void. It made me pause, though. Are we sacrificing real connection for the sake of seamless digital creation? Maybe a handwritten card would have been more heartfelt, less stressful. Just a thought.
