**The Unexpected Shift in My Investing Rhythm**

It’s funny how these little shifts in routine can suddenly feel… significant. Lately, I’ve been dipping my toes back into investing, and I’ve been a long-time Vanguard user.  Recently, I hit a snag – Vanguard changed its platform, and now I can only buy whole shares instead of those handy fractional ones. 

It felt oddly jarring, like a small piece of my investing process had been abruptly removed. It made me think about how much we rely on the smooth running of our systems, both digital and otherwise.  Sometimes, a seemingly minor change can disrupt a flow we’ve built, forcing us to adapt and re-evaluate. 

Maybe it’s a glitch, maybe it’s a change we need to embrace. Either way, it’s a reminder that life – and even investing – isn’t always about sticking rigidly to the plan.
