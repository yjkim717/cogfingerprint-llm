### The Portfast of Life

It’s funny how a network error can mirror life. Last week, a misconfigured “portfast” command on a C9300 switch at work brought a critical link to its knees, all because it tried to negotiate a connection it didn't need to.

It made me think about my own life in 2024. How often do I over-negotiate? I hesitate, seek endless validation, and wait for the perfect conditions before committing to a new hobby, a difficult conversation, or even just a weekend plan. That switch taught me a lesson: sometimes, you just have to bypass the lengthy, cautious process. You have to trust the connection and go for it.

Life, like a stable trunk link, often works best when we stop hesitating and just jump in.
