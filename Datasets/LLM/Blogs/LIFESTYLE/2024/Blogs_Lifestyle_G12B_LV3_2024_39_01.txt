## My Current Beauty Obsessions (and a Little Retail Therapy!)

Okay, friends, let’s talk beauty! Lately, I’ve been on a bit of a haul – a glorious, self-care-focused haul, if I’m being honest. It’s 2024, and after a long winter, I'm *really* leaning into feeling good from the outside in. 

It started with a few lipsticks – a classic red and a gorgeous berry shade that I just couldn't resist. Then, a stunning makeup set popped up with a discount, and well, you know how that goes! It felt like a little reward for finally finishing that project at work.

Beyond the makeup, I've been prioritizing skincare. My quest for the *perfect* sunscreen continues (it’s a never-ending journey, truly!), and I even managed to trade with a friend for a version I'd been eyeing – score!  My skin is definitely thanking me for the extra SPF.

And let's not forget haircare! I've been experimenting with a few new treatments, hoping to revive my hair after some serious heat styling. Plus, a new brow gel has completely transformed my brows – a tiny change that makes a *big* difference.

It's funny how these little beauty purchases can feel like so much more than just products. They're a way to treat myself, to acknowledge the effort I put in, and to cultivate a sense of well-being. And right now, racking up those reward points feels pretty good too! What are your current beauty favorites? Let me know in the comments!
