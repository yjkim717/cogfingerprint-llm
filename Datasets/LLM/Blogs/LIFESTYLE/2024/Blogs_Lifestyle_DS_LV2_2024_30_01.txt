It’s funny how the smallest things can make you pause and reflect. Just last week, I stood in my hallway, staring at a tangle of wires behind a light switch—trying to identify the neutral wire for a new dimmer. My home, built just a few years ago, felt like a mystery box.

In that quiet moment, I realized how much of our lives are hidden just beneath the surface: the wiring, the pipes, the unspoken hopes. We’re all just trying to connect the right pieces, to bring a little more light and control into our spaces. Sometimes, it’s not just about home improvement—it’s about understanding the foundations we build our days upon. And maybe, that’s a switch worth flipping.
