**Shining Stars & Quiet Anticipation**

It’s funny how we start looking ahead, isn’t it? As 2024 approaches, I’ve been really captivated by the buzz around rising stars. Zendaya, for example – seeing her command both ‘Challengers’ and ‘Dune: Part Two’ is incredible. It makes you wonder about the path to a breakout role, that moment where an actor truly connects with an audience.  Maybe it’s about finding the right story, or just letting your talent shine through.  I’m excited to see who will surprise us this year!
