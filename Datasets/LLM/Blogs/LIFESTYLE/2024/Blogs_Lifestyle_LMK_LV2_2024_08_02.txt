"Finding My Uniform: Navigating Professional Style in the Outdoor Industry"

As I stood in front of my closet, preparing for another day in the landscaping business, I couldn't help but feel a familiar frustration. As a sales director, I'm constantly switching between meeting with clients and getting my hands dirty on job sites. But my wardrobe wasn't making it easy. I struggled to find clothes that were both professional and comfortable, not to mention flattering on my plus-size frame. In an industry that's often rugged and casual, I felt like I was stuck between a rock and a hard hat. But as I started experimenting with business casual staples like tailored trousers and breathable tops, I began to craft a personal style that worked for me. It wasn't just about dressing for work - it was about finding confidence in my own skin, no matter what the day threw my way.
