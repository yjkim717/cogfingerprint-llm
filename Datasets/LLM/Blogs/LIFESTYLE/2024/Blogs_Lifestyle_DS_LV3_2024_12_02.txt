It’s 2024, and I’m still wrestling with my CPAP machine. I never thought my beard would become such a sticking point—literally and figuratively. When I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, I hoped treatment would be straightforward. But as a mouth breather, the nasal mask just doesn’t cut it. Every night feels like a battle to keep my mouth shut, and I’ve even tried a chin strap with little success.

Now I’m at a crossroads: do I finally shave this beard I’ve grown fond of, or switch to a full face mask that promises to work around it? It’s more than just a comfort issue—it’s about identity and health colliding. I’m holding out hope for a solution that lets me breathe easy and keep my signature look.
