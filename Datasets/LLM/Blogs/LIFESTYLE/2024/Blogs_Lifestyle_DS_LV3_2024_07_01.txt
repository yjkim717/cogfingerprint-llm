It’s 2024, and life’s twists keep coming. My sister’s husband is incarcerated, and suddenly, her VA benefits feel like a maze. We spent the morning on a VERA call, trying to untangle income limits and eligibility rules. It’s more than paperwork—it’s her stability, her peace of mind. I’m left wondering how many others are navigating these quiet, complicated battles alone. Sometimes, guidance isn’t just about answers; it’s about finding someone who truly listens.
