## The Unexpected Bloom of Hope

It’s funny, isn't it? How a Detroit Lions football game can unexpectedly trigger a feeling of…hope. As a lifelong Bills fan, watching their success feels genuinely good. But it's more than that. It’s remembering the years of quiet expectation, the low hum of *maybe this time*. Now, Lions fans are experiencing that thrill of expecting to win, and it’s a beautiful thing. 

It got me thinking about my own life. For so long, I accepted a certain level of "okay." Now, I'm noticing little blooms of hope – a new hobby, a rekindled friendship – and it feels surprisingly vibrant. Maybe expecting good things isn’t so surreal after all.
