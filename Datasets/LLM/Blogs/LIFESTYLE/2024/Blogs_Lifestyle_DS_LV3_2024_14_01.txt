It’s 2024, and by all accounts, I should be thriving. My thyroid levels are stable, I eat well, and I move my body—yet every day feels like wading through mental molasses. This isn’t just tiredness; it’s a deep, stubborn exhaustion that no amount of green juice or early nights seems to fix.

The real struggle is the brain fog. I sit down to work, my to-do list meticulously organized, but my focus scatters like leaves in the wind. Simple tasks take twice as long, and my motivation flickers weakly. In a world that prizes productivity, feeling this mentally clouded is isolating. You start to wonder, "Is it just me?"

But I’m learning to listen to my body’s whispers, not just follow the "rules" of wellness. Some days, the most productive thing I can do is rest without guilt. It’s a quiet rebellion against the pressure to always be "on"—and honestly, it’s a work in progress.
