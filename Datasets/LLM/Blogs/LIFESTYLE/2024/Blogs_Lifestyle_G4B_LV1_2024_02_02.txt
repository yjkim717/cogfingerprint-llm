**Re-evaluating My Data Habit**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we get stuck in routines. For years, I’ve been a PowerBI devotee, meticulously crafting dashboards, chasing that perfect insight. Lately, though, I’ve been feeling… restless. Like I was clinging to a tool rather than truly *using* data.

I’ve been reading about Yellowfin and its SaaS approach – the idea of just *getting* insights, rather than building them from scratch. It’s a compelling shift.  It’s made me wonder if I’m spending too much time on the “engineering” side of things, and not enough time actually asking the right questions. 

Maybe 2024 is the year I explore a smoother, more flexible way to visualize my life – a system that adapts to me, not the other way around.  Anyone else feeling a little data-déjà vu?
