As I gaze around my cluttered 3D printing workspace in 2024, I'm reminded that even the most mundane tasks can be frustrating. Like when my thermistor wiring picks up interference from the nearby stepper motor, throwing off my prints. It's a problem that requires patience and a dash of creativity to solve. Much like life, where the noise around us can disrupt our rhythm. By learning to 'harden' ourselves against the distractions, we can find our own flow and create something truly remarkable - just like a perfectly printed object.
