>## The Quest for the Perfect Travel Pant (and a Little Sanity)

Okay, real talk: packing for work travel in 2024 is a *thing*. It used to be a blazer and a skirt, but now it’s about finding clothes that can transition from board meeting to airport lounge, and still feel… good. I've been obsessing over these Bluffworks Petaluma pants – everyone raves about them! – but as a petite woman, finding them in my size has been a challenge. 

It's sparked a bigger realization though. I need versatile pieces, comfortable fabrics (ponte knit is calling my name!), and clothes that actually *work* with my frame. The search continues, but I'm determined to conquer this travel wardrobe puzzle!
