It’s 2024, and my phone is supposed to be my curated escape. But lately, my Reddit feed feels like a digital minefield. I just want to scroll through the latest posts, but instead, I’m dodging content I never asked to see. It’s a weirdly personal struggle—my little rectangle of calm shouldn’t require this much manual defense. It makes me wonder: in our quest for connection, are we just building better filters? Sometimes, the most modern skill is simply learning what to block out.
