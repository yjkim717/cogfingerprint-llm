## The Static Between Realities

Isn't it funny how nostalgia hits you? Lately, I’ve been obsessed with that old *War of the Worlds* broadcast – the sheer panic it induced! It got me thinking about how we crave stories that shake us, stories that feel *real*, even when they're fantastical.

I've been searching for something similar, an audiodrama that taps into that primal fear and wonder – maybe about first contact, or something paranormal lurking just beyond our perception. Something a bit…darker. 

It’s more than just entertainment, I think. It’s a yearning to feel *something*, a jolt out of the everyday.  We live in a world saturated with information, but sometimes, you need a fictional invasion – of aliens, ghosts, *anything* – to really appreciate the quiet hum of normalcy. Anyone else feel that? What stories are pulling you out of the routine lately?
