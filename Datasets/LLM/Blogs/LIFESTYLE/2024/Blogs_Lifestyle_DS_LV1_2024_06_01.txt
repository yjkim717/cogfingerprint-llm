It’s funny how a single number can make you rethink your entire life plan. For years, my condo wasn’t just a home; it was my anchor, my biggest asset. But when my realtor casually mentioned I could walk away with a $140,000 profit, a new, restless voice started whispering in my ear.

That number represents freedom. Freedom from surprise maintenance fees, rising property taxes, and the constant, low-grade worry of homeownership. What if I sold, became a happy renter again, and put that entire lump sum into a simple index fund? The math suggests the market’s long-term returns could outpace my condo’s appreciation, potentially giving me a bigger nest egg with far less daily hassle.

I’m now caught between the security of a physical asset and the allure of a liquid, hands-off investment. It feels like a choice between the known path and a potentially more profitable, flexible future. In 2024, with remote work redefining "home," maybe my biggest asset shouldn't be four walls, but the freedom to choose them.
