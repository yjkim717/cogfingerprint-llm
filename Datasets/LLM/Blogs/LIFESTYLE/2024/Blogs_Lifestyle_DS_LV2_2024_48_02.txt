My aunt’s email sat in my inbox for days: “Free timeshare, if you want it.” It sounded like a gift, but felt like a question mark on my future. In 2024, we’re all craving freedom and flexibility—so why tie myself to one place, one week, every year? I’m leaning toward no, but it’s making me think: what commitments are truly worth it? Sometimes the best gifts are the ones you gracefully decline.
