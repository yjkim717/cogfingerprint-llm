It’s funny how the little things—like renegotiating your broadband—can feel like a life lesson in 2024. I’d been with Virgin Media for years, comfortable but grumbling at each price hike. Finally, I mustered the nerve to give my notice.

Suddenly, I wasn’t just a customer; I was a person they wanted to keep. The retention team called, armed with offers. I’d done my homework, comparing deals elsewhere, and that knowledge was power. We haggled, we talked, and in the end, I secured a deal that felt fair.

It was a small victory, but it reminded me of a bigger truth: sometimes you have to be willing to walk away to get what you’re truly worth. It’s not just about broadband; it’s about knowing your value.
