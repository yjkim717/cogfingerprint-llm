**The Price of a Feeling**

It’s weird, isn’t it? We collectively lose our minds when it comes to concert ticket scalpers.  Suddenly, it’s *always* a moral failing. But I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately – why does scalping get such a harsher reaction than, say, buying a ridiculously expensive, limited-edition coffee or a one-of-a-kind vintage jacket? 

Isn’t there a similar ‘value’ at play?  We’re willing to pay a premium for experiences and unique items because they offer something beyond basic utility.  Maybe scalping just highlights that desire for access, a yearning for a specific moment. It’s a frustrating perspective, for sure, but maybe understanding *why* we react so strongly can help us unpack it.
