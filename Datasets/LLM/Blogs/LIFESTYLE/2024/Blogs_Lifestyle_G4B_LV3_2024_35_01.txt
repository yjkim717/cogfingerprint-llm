**Leveling Up My Free Time: MLB The Show and the Pull of the Digital**

Okay, real talk – 2024 has felt… intense. Between work and everything else, I’m constantly searching for little pockets of calm. Lately, that’s looked like sinking into *MLB The Show* online.  I’ll admit, I initially just wanted to smash some home runs in Event Mode, a quick, satisfying escape. 

But then I stumbled into Battle Royale – a completely different beast! – and the whole card collection aspect started to pull me in. It’s strangely addictive, isn’t it?  The urge to flip cards, to build a collection, almost feels like a little game within the game. 

It got me thinking about how we all chase those little rewards, those digital victories, to fill the quiet moments. Is it about the baseball, or is it about the feeling of accomplishment?  Maybe it's just a way to unwind and connect with something – even if it’s just a virtual diamond.  What are *your* go-to digital escapes this year?
