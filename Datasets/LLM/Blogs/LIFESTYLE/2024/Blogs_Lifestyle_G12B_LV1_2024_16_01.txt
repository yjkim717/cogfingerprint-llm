>## The Algorithm of Disappointment

Okay, let's be honest. I thought I was building a golden ticket. Four years, countless all-nighters fuelled by lukewarm coffee, a Computer Engineering degree with a Data Science specialization… I pictured myself swimming in opportunities, a highly sought-after cog in the innovation machine. 2024, right? The year AI was supposed to *really* take off, and everyone needed data wizards.

Instead? I'm staring at a job board that feels less like a treasure map and more like an endless scroll of "Entry Level - 3+ years experience required." It’s…deflating. 

I’m not saying it’s all doom and gloom. There *are* jobs, sure. But the sheer volume of applicants, the relentless competition, and the feeling that my carefully cultivated skillset is somehow...less valuable than I’d hoped. It’s left me questioning a lot. Did I choose the right path? Should I have focused on something else? 

It’s a weird feeling, this disillusionment. It’s not about wanting to quit, it’s about recalibrating expectations. Maybe the algorithm of the job market isn't as predictable as I thought. Maybe the real value isn't in the degree itself, but in what I *do* with it.  I'm starting to think the hustle isn’t just about learning the latest frameworks; it’s about proving I can adapt, learn, and build something truly useful, even when the numbers don't quite add up.
