It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking a lot about the great urban shuffle that started a few years back. Remember when it felt like everyone was packing up and leaving the city for good? Seaside towns and countryside cottages suddenly became the dream—a quiet life, more space, a slower pace.

But lately, I’ve noticed a shift. Friends who swore they’d never return to London are quietly slipping back. They miss the buzz, the spontaneity, the way the city hums with life. It’s not that the countryside wasn’t lovely—it’s just that cities are regenerating, too. New parks, community hubs, and a renewed sense of energy are drawing people back.

Maybe it’s not about choosing one over the other forever. Perhaps it’s about finding balance, and letting our lives ebb and flow like the tides we once chased.
