**Small Changes, Big Shifts**

It’s funny how little things can suddenly feel… significant. This week, Vanguard shook up their platform, and it’s thrown a tiny bit of a wrench in my investment strategy. They’ve dropped the ability to buy fractional shares – now it’s whole dollar amounts only. 

Honestly, it’s a surprisingly poignant reminder that even in the world of investing, life is about adjusting. I’d gotten so used to easily snapping up a little piece of a company I believed in, it felt almost seamless. Now, I’m consciously thinking about rounding up, making slightly bigger purchases. 

It’s not a huge deal, really, but it's made me realize how much we adapt and shift our routines, sometimes without even noticing.  Maybe it’s time to take a broader look at those small adjustments in my life – are they truly serving me?
