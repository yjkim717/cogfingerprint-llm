**The Great Mask Struggle (and My Shaved-Beard Dilemma)**

Let’s be honest, adulting is weird. Lately, I’ve been battling some seriously restless nights thanks to sleep apnea. The CPAP machine is a lifesaver, truly, but finding the *right* mask has been a surprisingly emotional journey. I’m a guy with a decent beard – a little bit of a stubborn one, if I’m being honest – and the thought of shaving every night just to wear a mask felt… exhausting. It’s funny how a medical device can suddenly become a major lifestyle hurdle!  I’m hoping to find a mask that works with my face, not against it.  Anyone else have this struggle?
