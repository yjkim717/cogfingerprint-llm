### Finding My Morning Ritual in a Cup of Rose Tea

It’s 2024, and like everyone else, I’m trying to claw back a little serenity from the frantic pace of life. My quest for a calmer morning led me to an unexpected place: my teacup. Specifically, to two beautiful rose-infused black teas that have become my daily compass.

On rushed weekdays, I reach for "Belle's Breakfast." Its rose note is a soft whisper, a gentle floral backdrop to the sturdy, malty black tea that wakes me up properly. It’s the perfect bridge between my need for caffeine and my desire for a moment of quiet beauty before the day begins.

But on slow Sunday mornings, the ritual changes. That’s when I brew the delicate "Rose Pouchong." Here, the rose is the star—an aromatic, velvety petal that unfurls in the cup. Sipping it feels less like drinking tea and more like a meditation. It doesn’t just wake me up; it reminds me to slow down.

These two teas taught me that a ritual isn't about rigid rules, but about having the right tools for the right moment. Some days you need a nudge, others you need a hug. My teapot is now ready for either.
