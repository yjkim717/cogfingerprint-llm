Is homeownership really the cornerstone of the “good life” we’ve been sold? I’m genuinely starting to wonder.

For years, my condo wasn’t just a home; it was my primary investment. Every mortgage payment felt like a step toward secure adulthood. But lately, that feeling has been replaced by the weight of maintenance fees, property taxes, and a nagging question: What if this isn't the best path to financial freedom?

I’m now seriously considering a pivot. What if I sold the condo, banked the profit, and became a renter again? The idea of funneling that capital into a diversified stock portfolio is incredibly tempting. It feels less like a physical anchor and more like a dynamic engine for my **retirement savings**.

This isn’t just about an **investment strategy**; it’s about lifestyle design. Could renting provide the flexibility I crave while my money works harder elsewhere? It’s a scary thought, challenging a lifetime of conditioning. But my brief **homeownership regrets** are morphing into a new kind of **financial planning**—one that prioritizes liquidity and freedom over a deed. The American Dream might need a 2024 update.
