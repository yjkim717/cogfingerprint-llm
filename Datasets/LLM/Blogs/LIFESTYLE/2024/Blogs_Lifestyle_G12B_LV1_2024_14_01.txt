## The Murky Middle Ground: When "Healthy" Isn't Enough

It's 2024, and we're all chasing peak performance, right? Fueling our bodies, hitting the gym, prioritizing sleep… I thought I had it nailed. I’m an ultrarunner, after all. Endurance is practically my job description. But lately, I’ve been wading through a persistent fog. Not physical exhaustion, though that’s been a guest too, but a mental haze. Brain fog, the kind that makes focusing on a simple email feel like scaling Everest.

The frustrating part? My thyroid is stable, my diet is dialed in, and I’m (mostly) getting enough sleep. So why this lingering sense of…offness? It’s made me question everything. Are my training loads too high? Am I overlooking a subtle nutrient deficiency? 

I’ve been talking to other athletes, and it seems more and more of us are experiencing this murky middle ground – the space between “doing everything right” and actually *feeling* right. It’s a reminder that health isn't a checklist, it's a complex, ever-shifting landscape. I'm diving deeper into mindfulness and stress management now, hoping to clear the fog and rediscover that sharp, focused feeling again. Anyone else been there?
