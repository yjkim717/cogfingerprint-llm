**Two Years Down, Forever to Go**

Okay, let’s be real. 2024 feels like a proper turning point, doesn’t it? We’re all chasing something – a better job, a healthier routine, a little more peace. For me, that “something” was, and frankly still *is*, sobriety. It’s been two years now, and honestly, it feels both monumental and incredibly simple all at once. 

I stumbled into Alcoholics Anonymous pretty blindly, really. I’d read about it, heard the stories, but it felt… daunting. The *Big Book* was intimidating, a hefty tome filled with voices from the past. But I started reading it, slowly, deliberately, tackling one step at a time. Those steps – honesty, humility, making amends – they weren’t just buzzwords; they became a framework for rebuilding my life. 

It wasn't a dramatic overnight transformation. There were slip-ups, moments of intense craving, and times I wanted to just throw the whole thing out the window. But the support network through AA, and the grounding in those principles, kept me going. 

What’s surprising is how normal it’s become. I still have moments of wanting a drink, but now I have the tools to recognize it, to name it, and to walk away. It's a daily practice, a conscious choice. It’s not about perfection; it's about progress. And as I look ahead, I’m reminded that “forever to go” isn’t a scary concept – it’s a promise.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps write a post focused on a specific aspect (e.g., the role of the Big Book, the support of AA meetings)?
