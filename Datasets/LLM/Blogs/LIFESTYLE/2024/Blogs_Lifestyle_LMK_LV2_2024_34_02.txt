As I ponder our next family RV adventure, I'm weighing the pros and cons of a 5th wheel with a separate bunk room. My kids, aged 9 and 6, crave independence, but will it isolate them from us? A dedicated bunk room could mean better sleep for all, but what about quality time? In 2024, we're chasing memories, not just miles. Is a separate bunk room the key to harmony on the open road, or will it drive us further apart?
