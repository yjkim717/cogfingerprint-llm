## Bunk Room vs. Bunks: The Great RV Kid Conundrum of 2024

Okay, fellow RV adventurers, let’s talk kids and camper layouts! My family's eyeing a sub-33' 5th wheel or travel trailer, and the big question is: bunk room or traditional bunks? Our little ones are 9 and 6, and we occasionally host friends. 

A bunk room feels cozy, a little haven. But traditional bunks offer more flexibility, right? I'm really curious to hear from those already living the RV life. What's been your experience? Do the kids feel cramped in a bunk room? Is maneuvering around traditional bunks a hassle? Drop your wisdom – we're making a big decision!
