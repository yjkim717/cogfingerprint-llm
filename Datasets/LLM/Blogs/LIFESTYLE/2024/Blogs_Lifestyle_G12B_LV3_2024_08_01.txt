## Belfast Bound & Briefly Bewildered: Navigating a New City

There's something uniquely disorienting about stepping off a long bus journey, blinking in the unfamiliar light of a new city. That was me yesterday, arriving in Belfast, ready to see a friend but immediately facing a small logistical hurdle: getting across town. 

My phone, bless its heart, decided to stage a connectivity protest the moment I disembarked. No data. No instant Uber or Lyft. Suddenly, the ease of modern travel felt a little… distant. 

It got me thinking about how reliant we've become on those apps. While incredibly convenient, what happens when that digital safety net disappears? I ended up hailing a taxi, and honestly, it was a surprisingly pleasant experience. A quick chat with the driver, a glimpse of the city through a different lens – it felt more connected than tapping a screen ever could. Sometimes, a little bit of old-fashioned navigation is exactly what you need.
