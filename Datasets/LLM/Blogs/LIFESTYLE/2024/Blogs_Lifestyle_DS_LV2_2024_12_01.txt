### From Desk Dives to Deep Dives: Finding My Current

It’s funny how a life can pivot on a single, restless thought. For years, mine was measured in quarterly reports and the gentle hum of server racks. I was a telecommunications guy in Vancouver—a good job, a stable life. But staring at the same screen in 2024, a year everyone said would be defined by AI, I felt a deep, human craving for something… tangible.

The turning point wasn't dramatic. It was a rainy Saturday, watching a documentary on commercial divers working on the underwater infrastructure of our own city. Here were people not manipulating data, but manipulating the physical world, in a silent, weightless realm. The spark was immediate. A career change? At my age? The idea seemed as vast and intimidating as the Pacific itself.

But Vancouver, with its relentless, beautiful coast, offered a path. I discovered this city is a hub for commercial diving, with top-tier schools offering certifications and, crucially, year-round job opportunities. It wasn’t a pipe dream; it was a plan. The decision to enroll felt less like jumping off a cliff and more like finally learning to swim.

Now, as I study dive tables instead of data tables, the connection is clearer than ever. I’m not running from my old life; I’m building on it. That meticulous attention to detail from telecom? Vital for safety underwater. The patience for complex systems? Essential for troubleshooting at depth.

This journey isn’t about rejecting my past, but about rediscovering a part of myself that got lost in the digital noise. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most profound shift begins not with a leap, but with a simple question: What if my hands could build what my mind once only managed?
