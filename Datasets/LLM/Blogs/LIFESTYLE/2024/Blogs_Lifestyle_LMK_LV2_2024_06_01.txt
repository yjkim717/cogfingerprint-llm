"Should I Cash Out My Condo? Weighing the Pros and Cons in 2024"

As I sit on my balcony, sipping coffee and gazing out at the city skyline, I'm reminded of the condo I've called home for years. But with retirement on the horizon, I'm rethinking my attachment to this property. The thought of selling and investing the profit in a diversified index fund is tantalizing. I'd be trading in the headaches of homeownership for the potential long-term gains of the stock market. But is it worth leaving behind the comfort and security of owning my own home? I've always believed that owning is better than renting, but is that still true for me? As I weigh my options, I'm forced to confront my own biases and priorities. Is it time to cash out and simplify my life, or hold on to the familiar? The decision isn't easy, but one thing is certain - it's time to rethink my retirement strategy.
