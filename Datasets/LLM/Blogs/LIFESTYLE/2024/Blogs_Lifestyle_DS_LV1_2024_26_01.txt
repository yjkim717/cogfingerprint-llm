It’s funny how we pick and choose our reselling villains, isn’t it? Just last week, I snagged a gorgeous 1970s armchair from a local seller, thrilled by my "sustainable find." Yet, when I failed to get tickets for a major 2024 tour because bots bought them all in seconds, I was furious at the "scalpers."

Why the disconnect? I think it’s about perceived value and access. That vintage chair feels like a curated treasure hunt. But a concert is a fleeting, emotional experience. When resellers block that raw, human connection for pure profit, it hits differently. It feels less like commerce and more like stealing a memory. Maybe we just hate what reminds us of life’s scarcest currency: time.
