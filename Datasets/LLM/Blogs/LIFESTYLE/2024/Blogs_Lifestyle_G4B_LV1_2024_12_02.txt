**The Night I Almost Gave Up on Sleep (and Found a New Mask)**

Okay, real talk – 2024 has been… a year. Between work and everything else, sleep has been a serious battle. For months, I was wrestling with my CPAP machine, and honestly, it was making things *worse*. I’d wake up with a dry mouth, constantly adjusting the nasal mask, and just feeling completely frustrated. 

Turns out, I was mouth breathing through the night – a common problem, apparently. My sleep doc suggested a chin strap, which helped a little, but I still felt like I was fighting the machine.  Recently, I switched to a full-face mask, and it’s been a game-changer. It’s a little weird at first, but it’s finally letting me get *real* rest.  It’s a small change, but it’s made a huge difference in my energy levels.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
