As I sipped my morning coffee in 2024, I couldn't shake off the lingering fatigue. I'd recovered from COVID weeks ago, but the memory of those grueling days still lingered. With Paxlovid making headlines as a potential game-changer for COVID rebound, I found myself wondering if I'd be a candidate. My symptoms had been mild, but the thought of a fever and exhaustion returning was daunting. I've since taken precautions to boost my immunity, prioritizing rest and a balanced diet. While Paxlovid may be a safety net, I'm focusing on lifestyle tweaks to keep COVID at bay â€“ and my energy levels intact.
