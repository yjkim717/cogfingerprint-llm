**Trading City Lights for Pine Needles**

This summer, I finally booked a weekend at Blackwoods Campground in Acadian National Park. It felt…different, stepping away from the constant hum of the city. I was prepping for a solo tent trip, picturing myself lost in the redwoods, and a little anxious about the whole thing. 

Turns out, disconnecting is surprisingly restorative.  I spent hours just listening to the birds and realizing how much I’d forgotten about slowing down.  It’s sparked a desire to explore more wild places – maybe even rent a car and hit some more international campgrounds next year!

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
