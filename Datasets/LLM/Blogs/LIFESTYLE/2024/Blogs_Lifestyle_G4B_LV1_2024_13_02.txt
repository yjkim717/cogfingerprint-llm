**Lost in the Metaverse, Found by Wi-Fi**

Okay, confession time: my Quest 3 has become a *thing*. Seriously, I’m spending hours lost in virtual desktops, battling dragons, and generally escaping reality. But there’s a frustrating little hiccup – the connection keeps dropping when my PC and the router are more than a few feet apart. It's maddening! 

Recently, I started researching wireless access points, specifically looking at Airlink and the potential of Wi-Fi 6E.  It’s amazing how much of a difference a solid, reliable connection can make.  It’s not just about the games; it’s about truly immersing myself. 

Honestly, it’s shifted my whole approach to home tech.  I used to just grab whatever was cheapest. Now, I’m realizing that a little investment in a better wireless setup is an investment in my digital wellbeing.  Anyone else experiencing this Quest connectivity struggle?
