### The Unseen Battle in My 3D Printer

I was chasing a ghost in my 3D printer—random temperature spikes that ruined prints. My hotend’s thermistor readings would jump erratically, and I noticed my stepper motors were running unusually hot. After days of frustration, I discovered the culprit wasn't a faulty component, but an invisible war. The powerful electrical noise from the stepper motor wires was bleeding into the delicate signal from the unshielded thermistor wiring, confusing the Klipper firmware. The fix was simple in hindsight: proper shielding, separation of the wires, and adjusting the motor's `hold_current` to reduce unnecessary electrical noise. It was a powerful lesson in paying attention to the quiet signals amidst the noise.

### The Art of Unplugging

In 2024, my most radical act has been to deliberately get a little lost. Last Sunday, I left my phone at home and just walked. No destination, no podcast in my ears. At first, the silence was deafening, my thumb twitching for a screen. But then, I noticed the specific rustle of a magnolia leaf and the way the afternoon light hit a puddle just so. I returned home an hour later, not with a checked-off to-do list, but with a quiet, recalibrated mind. It’s in these small, unplugged moments that I remember how to simply be.
