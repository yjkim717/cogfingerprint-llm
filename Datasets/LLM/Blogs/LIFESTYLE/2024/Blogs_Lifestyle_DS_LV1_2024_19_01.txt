### The Unseen Guardian: Finding Peace in a Mini PC

It’s funny how priorities shift. In my twenties, a new laptop meant better gaming or a sleeker design for coffee shops. Now, in 2024, my latest tech obsession is a humble mini PC humming quietly in a closet. Its mission? To be the silent guardian of our home.

The catalyst was a package left on our porch that vanished. It was a small thing, but it shattered my sense of security. I dove into the world of home surveillance, quickly getting lost in a sea of cloud subscriptions and privacy concerns. That’s when I discovered a different path: building my own system with local AI processing.

Now, three high-definition cameras watch over our property, but the real brain is that little machine running Blue Iris and DeepStack. It doesn’t just record everything; it intelligently distinguishes between a wandering cat and a person approaching the door. There’s a profound peace that comes from this self-reliant setup. It’s not about paranoia, but about proactively crafting a safer, more mindful environment. My high-tech security system ended up teaching me a low-tech lesson: sometimes, the greatest comfort lies in the things you set up to forget about.
