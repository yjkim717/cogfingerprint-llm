As I sit here gaming on my Steam deck, I'm pondering my controller setup. I've been using my Nintendo Switch Pro controller for months now, and it's been a great companion. However, with the PS4 and PS5 controllers gathering dust, I'm considering a switch. Will I make the change? Only time will tell. For now, I'm enjoying the comfort and familiarity of my current setup, but the alternatives are tempting.
