## The Dirt Under My Nails & the Polish on My Shoes

It’s funny, isn’t it, how our careers shape us in ways we don't always anticipate? I’m Sarah, and I’m a Sales Director for a landscaping company – a role that, let's be honest, involves a surprising amount of time knee-deep in mulch and surveying sprinkler systems. But it *also* means representing the company, meeting clients, and closing deals. 

For years, I struggled with the wardrobe disconnect. I’d feel completely out of place in a stuffy suit, but equally unprofessional in my usual work boots and jeans when meeting with a homeowner about their dream garden. It felt like I was constantly trying to choose between two versions of myself.

This year, I’ve really been focusing on finding that sweet spot – a “creative edge” that feels authentically *me*. It’s been a journey of experimenting with tailored trousers that can handle a little mud, blouses with sleeves that roll up easily, and even finding fantastic blazers that don’t scream “boardroom” but still convey confidence. 

It’s not just about the clothes, though. It’s about feeling comfortable and confident in my own skin, regardless of whether I’m presenting a proposal or pulling weeds. Body image has always been something I’ve wrestled with, and finding clothes that fit *my* body, and my lifestyle, has been surprisingly empowering. It's about owning my role, my strength, and yes, even the occasional bit of dirt under my nails.
