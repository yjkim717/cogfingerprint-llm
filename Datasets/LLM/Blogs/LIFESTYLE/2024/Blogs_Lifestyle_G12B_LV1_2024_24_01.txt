## The City's Calling Again? A Little Post-Pandemic Re-Think

Remember that initial exodus? 2020 felt like everyone decided to pack up and head for the countryside. Suddenly, sourdough starters and sprawling gardens were the ultimate status symbols. I even considered it myself! The allure of peace and quiet, away from the London hustle, was *strong*.

But lately, I’ve been catching myself scrolling through property listings in Zone 2 again. It started with a random TikTok – a guy lamenting the isolation of rural life and dreaming of a bustling coffee shop. It got me thinking. 

While the countryside has its undeniable charms, that initial escape felt…temporary. The convenience of being close to friends, the sheer energy of a city, the access to everything – it’s a powerful pull.  

We’re two years into 2024 now.  The initial pandemic fervor has faded. Maybe the pendulum is starting to swing back. I’m not saying everyone's rushing back to London, but I suspect a lot of us are realizing that while peace is lovely, a little bit of vibrant chaos isn't so bad after all.  What about you? Are you feeling the city calling?
