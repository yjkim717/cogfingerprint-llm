## Thanksgiving Doesn't Have to Be a Panic!

Okay, let's be real – Thanksgiving can feel *intense*. This year, I saw a Reddit thread full of people dreading the holiday cooking chaos, and it hit home. I’m determined to change my approach in 2024. The goal? A relaxed Thursday, fueled by serious meal prep beforehand. Think: chopping veggies days early, prepping pie crusts, and tackling sides ahead of time. Less frantic cooking, more quality time – that’s the dream, right?
