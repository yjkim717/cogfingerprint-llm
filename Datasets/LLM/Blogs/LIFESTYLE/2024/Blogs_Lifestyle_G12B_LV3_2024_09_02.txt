## Did Anyone Else Feel That? A Sydney Rumble and a Moment of Pause

Okay, Sydney, did anyone else’s house give a little *shudder* this morning? I was just making coffee when I felt this brief, almost unsettling shake. Not a big deal, thankfully, but enough to make me pause and look around. Apparently, others felt it too – people are speculating about an earth tremor, maybe even just a rumble from the trains. 

It’s funny, isn't it? How a tiny, unexpected event can pull you right out of autopilot and force you to just *notice* the present moment. A little shake, a moment of stillness… sometimes that’s all it takes.
