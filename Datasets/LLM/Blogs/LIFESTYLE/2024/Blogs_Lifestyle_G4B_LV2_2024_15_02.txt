**The Frustrations of a Friday Night (and Ticket Troubles)**

Anyone else feel like 2024 is just… a *lot*? Between work, trying to squeeze in some semblance of a social life, and the constant buzz of notifications, it’s easy to feel a little overwhelmed. It actually reminded me of a frustrating experience last week. I was desperately trying to snag away tickets for Sheffield United – a long-held dream for my partner – and the whole eticketing process just completely fell apart. 

Website crashes, no confirmation emails, the works! It’s a tiny thing, I know, but it just highlighted how easily technology can disrupt even the simplest plans. Sometimes, you just want a smooth, straightforward experience.  It made me realize how important it is to take a step back and appreciate the little wins, and maybe even just accept that some Friday nights are destined for a quiet night in.
