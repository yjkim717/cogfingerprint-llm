Navigating Belfast as a tourist can be a bit daunting, especially when you're arriving by bus from the airport. As I stood on the bustling streets in 2024, I wondered how I'd get across town. Luckily, I discovered that Belfast has a reliable public transportation system, including buses and the Glider service, making it easy to explore the city. With a little planning, you can seamlessly travel between attractions, taking in the city's rich history and culture. Whether you're visiting the Titanic Belfast or strolling along the Lagan, getting around is simpler than you think.
