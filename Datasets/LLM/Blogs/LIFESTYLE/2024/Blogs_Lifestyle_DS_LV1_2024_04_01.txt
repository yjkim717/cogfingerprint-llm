It’s funny how life changes. Last year, I inherited my grandparents’ old farmhouse—a place full of memories but miles from my city life. Suddenly, I was thrust into the world of rural property and real estate, trying to understand appraisal costs and property valuation before selling. It felt overwhelming at first, but it taught me to slow down and appreciate the process. Now, I see it not just as a transaction, but as honoring a legacy. Sometimes, the unexpected journeys bring the deepest lessons.
