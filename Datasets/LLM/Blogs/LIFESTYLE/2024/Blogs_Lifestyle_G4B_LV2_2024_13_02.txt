**Lost in the Metaverse, Found in My Living Room**

Let’s be honest, 2024 feels a little…digital, right? I’ve been completely hooked on my Oculus Quest lately, losing hours exploring virtual worlds and battling digital dragons. But there’s a frustrating little snag: my connection keeps cutting out. 

It’s not the Quest itself, of course. It’s my setup. My PC and router are stubbornly wedged in corners of the living room, creating a dead zone for my VR adventures. I was seriously considering a whole new wireless router, maybe even an AirLink, just to get a stable signal. 

It made me think about how much of our lives are now tied to these little tech hubs. We crave immersion, but sometimes, the simplest things – like a reliable WiFi connection – can throw a wrench in the fun. It’s a reminder that even in the metaverse, a little bit of real-world practicality matters.
