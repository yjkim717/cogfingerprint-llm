**Trading City Noise for Pine Needles**

There’s something about the pull of the wild, isn’t there? This year, I found myself seriously contemplating a weekend escape – a real disconnect. It started with a friend messaging me about Acadian National Park, specifically Blackwoods Campground. Suddenly, the idea of tent camping felt…right. 

I pictured an international tourist, just like in the blog post I read, overwhelmed with excitement and a healthy dose of “what am I doing?” – a feeling I instantly recognized.  It’s the beautiful chaos of stepping outside your comfort zone, right?  I’m already dreaming of rental cars and starry nights.  Anyone else craving a little wilderness this fall?
