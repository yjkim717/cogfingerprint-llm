>## The COVID Rollercoaster & That Paxlovid Question

Okay, so I've been wrestling with something lately, and I figured maybe sharing it would help… and maybe someone else out there is feeling the same. I thought I’d finally kicked COVID. Seriously, I felt like I was turning a corner, energy returning, the lingering fatigue starting to fade. Then, bam! A few days later, some familiar symptoms crept back in – a scratchy throat, a bit of a cough. It's not as bad as the initial infection, but definitely *something*.

It’s this weird, fluctuating feeling, like a rollercoaster of recovery. I saw a post on Reddit the other day describing something similar, a “rebound” effect after what seemed like a successful recovery. It got me thinking. 

My doctor mentioned Paxlovid, but the idea of starting it now, after feeling better, feels…confusing. There's so much conflicting information out there, and I'm hesitant to jump into another treatment. Anyone else been through this? Has anyone else experienced a COVID rebound and considered Paxlovid? I'd love to hear your experiences – just looking for some solidarity and maybe a little guidance as I navigate this unpredictable journey.
