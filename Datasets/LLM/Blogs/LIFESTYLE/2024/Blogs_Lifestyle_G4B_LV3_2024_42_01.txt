**The Silent Sting of the Tailgate**

It’s a small thing, really. A car persistently glued to my bumper. But lately, those moments on the highway have been triggering a surprising amount of… well, frustration. I find myself instantly spiraling, wondering what’s driving the person behind me – is it a genuine emergency, or just a simmering impatience? 

Honestly, it’s exhausting.  We’re all just trying to get to where we need to be, and that constant pressure just seems to amplify the existing stress of the day. It’s a miniature echo of road rage, a tiny spark of aggression ignited by a simple act. 

I’ve realized it’s more than just the driver; it’s *me*.  Maybe I’m projecting my own anxieties onto them.  I’m working on letting those moments roll off, reminding myself that a little space and a deep breath can do wonders.  It’s about choosing to respond with calm, rather than letting a tailgater steal my peace of mind.  What small shifts are *you* making to navigate the everyday frustrations?
