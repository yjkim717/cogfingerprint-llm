The old farmhouse key felt heavy in my palm. After Mom passed, this rural property became my responsibility, a place frozen in time. I wandered through rooms filled with echoes, wondering about its true worth beyond sentiment. The practical side of me knew I needed an appraisal—what would it cost? What’s its real value in today’s market? Selling it feels like closing a chapter, but first, I need to understand what I’m letting go. It’s more than a house; it’s a lifetime of memories waiting for a price tag.
