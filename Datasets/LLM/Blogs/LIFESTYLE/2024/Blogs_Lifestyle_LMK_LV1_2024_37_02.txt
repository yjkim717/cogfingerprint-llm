As I sat down to play Final Fantasy IX again, I couldn't help but think of the parallels between the game's Mognet quest and my own life. Getting stuck on a crucial letter chain can be frustrating, much like when we're trying to get our lives back on track. Reflecting on my 2024 goals, I realized that sometimes, it's not about doing more, but about reconnecting with what's truly important. Just like revisiting an earlier save in the game, I've been revisiting my priorities to get back on the right path.
