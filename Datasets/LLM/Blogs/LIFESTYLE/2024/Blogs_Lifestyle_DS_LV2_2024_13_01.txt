The other day, I was watching my friend—a day trader—frantically refreshing his screen, waiting for a broker’s confirmation that his trade had gone through. “If only TradingView could just tell my journaling app directly,” he sighed, “I’d have time for a coffee, maybe even a deep breath.”

It hit me then: we’re all waiting on some “confirmation” to feel like we’ve moved forward, aren’t we? Whether it’s a text reply, a project approval, or just a sign we’re on the right path. In 2024, life moves fast, but we’re often stuck in these little pauses, these delays that hold us back from fully living.

Maybe it’s time to build our own “webhooks”—little bridges of trust and intuition—so we don’t miss the moment while waiting for the green light.
