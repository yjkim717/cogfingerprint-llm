## The Unexpected Comfort of the Familiar

It's funny how travel can throw your routines into such sharp relief. I was recently planning a quick trip from LAX to Yorba Linda – a short hop, really – and got completely bogged down in the rental car debate. Turo, with its promises of unique finds and potentially better deals, was tempting. But honestly, the sheer number of options and the slight anxiety of dealing with individual owners felt overwhelming. 

I spent way too much time researching, comparing, and second-guessing. Ultimately, I defaulted to Avis. It felt…safe. Predictable. And you know what? It was exactly what I needed. 

This whole experience made me think about how much we chase novelty in life. We’re constantly told to disrupt, to explore, to try new things. And that's good! But sometimes, the quiet comfort of the familiar – the dependability of a brand you trust, a routine that soothes – can be just as valuable. Sometimes, choosing Avis instead of the unknown is a perfectly valid, and even necessary, act of self-care. 2024 feels like a year for embracing that, doesn’t it?
