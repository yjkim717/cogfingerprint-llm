**The Weight of “What If?”**

It’s funny, isn’t it? At 23, I feel like everyone else has a neatly-packaged life mapped out. Meanwhile, I’m stuck in a loop of job dissatisfaction, staring at my laptop screen and feeling this…heavy weight of “what if?” It’s not a dramatic, movie-worthy kind of unhappiness, but a persistent, low-humming boredom that’s starting to feel exhausting. 

This year, 2024, I’ve realized I can’t keep ignoring it. That restless feeling? It’s not a flaw; it’s a signal. A signal that I desperately need to explore. I'm starting to realize that career uncertainty isn’t a failure, but a huge potential waiting to be unlocked. 

I'm not sure *where* that potential lies yet – honestly, the thought of a completely different path is a little terrifying. But the alternative – continuing down a road that doesn't truly spark joy – feels even worse.  It’s about gently pushing myself to investigate, to try things, and to embrace the beautiful mess of figuring out what actually fits.  Anyone else feeling this pull toward something new?
