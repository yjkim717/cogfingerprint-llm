As I navigated the aftermath of Mint's shutdown in 2024, I stumbled upon Monarch Money and decided to give it a try. The 30-day free trial was the perfect opportunity to test its waters. I'm thrilled to say that it's become my go-to personal finance tool, helping me streamline my budgeting and financial management. If you're looking for a Mint replacement, I highly recommend giving Monarch Money a shot - it's been a game-changer for my financial clarity.
