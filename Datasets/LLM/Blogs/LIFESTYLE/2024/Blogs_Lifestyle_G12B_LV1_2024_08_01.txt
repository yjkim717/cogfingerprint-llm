## Belfast Brain Fog & the Unexpected Taxi Revelation

Okay, so picture this: me, fresh off a long-haul bus journey into Belfast last week. My brain felt like scrambled eggs, and the thought of navigating a new city, let alone figuring out public transport, was utterly exhausting. Driving? Forget about it. I was operating on fumes.

Initially, I was eyeing up the app-based ride services – you know, Uber and Lyft. But something felt… off. A bit impersonal. Then, a local recommended Fonacab. A proper Belfast taxi service. 

And honestly? It was *perfect*. The driver, Liam, was a fountain of local knowledge, pointing out landmarks and even giving me a quick history lesson. It felt far more connected than staring at a screen.

It made me think about travel, and about life really. Sometimes, chasing the "new" and the "techy" can make us miss out on the charm of the traditional. Sometimes, a friendly face and a local expert are the best shortcuts to feeling truly present in a place – and sometimes, a taxi ride can be a surprisingly insightful moment.
