**The Quiet Joy of Sharing Scents**

There’s something wonderfully nostalgic about perfume, isn’t there? I was browsing a little corner of the online fragrance world the other day, and stumbled upon a beautiful Roja Oceania bottle being offered – and traded! It got me thinking about how much joy we can find in sharing these little luxuries.  Like a tiny, fragrant swap, it’s about connecting with others and discovering new favorites.  Maybe 2024 will be the year I finally embrace the beauty of a fragrance trade!
