It’s 2024, and I’ve been reflecting on how a single bad choice can spiral. A friend’s cousin got tangled up in an online scam, using a stolen card to order laptops. It wasn't just about the card; state laws meant he faced theft charges for the items, too. It’s a stark reminder that shortcuts often lead to legal mazes and lost trust. In our digital world, integrity isn’t just a virtue—it’s your shield.
