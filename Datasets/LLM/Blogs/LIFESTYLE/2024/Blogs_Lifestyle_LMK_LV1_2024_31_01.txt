The eternal quest for the perfect biryani! As someone who's spent years perfecting my Indian cooking skills, I've tried my fair share of pre-packaged biryani masala mixes. But, oh, the disappointment that often follows. From bland to overpowering, most store-bought mixes just don't cut it. I recall trying Shaan spice mix, thinking it would be a safe bet, but it was too spicy for my taste. I've also experimented with other brands, only to be left underwhelmed. My search continues for a mild yet flavorful biryani masala mix that elevates my dishes without overpowering them. In today's world, where convenience is key, it's surprising that a good pre-packaged spice mix is hard to come by. As I navigate the aisles of 2024's supermarkets, I'm holding out hope that I'll stumble upon the perfect blend. Until then, I'll keep experimenting, driven by the promise of a fragrant, mouth-watering biryani that brings my family and friends together.
