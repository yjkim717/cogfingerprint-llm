**Remembering "Friends" While Scrolling Through TikTok**

Okay, let’s be honest – how many of us have spent the last few weeks binge-watching *Friends* again? It’s a total comfort blanket, isn’t it? And while rewatching Ross and Rachel’s chaotic love story is undeniably delightful, I’ve been doing a little thinking about something… our friendships.

It’s funny, right? We’re constantly bombarded with images of perfect, effortlessly cool friendships online. TikTok friendships, Instagram “besties,” the whole shebang. But then you compare that to the reality of your own life, and it can feel a little… well, superficial. 

I recently spent a few months on an Erasmus program, and it completely shifted my perspective. I made some incredible, deep connections with people from all over Europe – people I *knew* I wanted to stay in touch with. It felt different than the connections I’d made back home, built mostly around shared classes and weekend plans. 

There’s something about those TV show friendships, I think, that’s so appealing because they’re *contained*. They exist within a specific narrative, with clear storylines and resolutions. Real life, of course, is messier, more complicated, and often far less dramatic. 

But that doesn’t mean it’s lacking depth. It just means we need to be more intentional about nurturing the friendships that truly matter – the ones that feel like home, even when they’re not always perfectly curated for Instagram. 

What about you? Are you finding yourself comparing your friendships to the silver screen?
