As I sit here knitting in 2024, I'm on the hunt for the perfect yarn to bring the Fox and Folk mitts pattern to life. I'm drawn to a dark gray DK weight yarn, and baby alpaca is my top choice. There's something about the softness and warmth it provides that feels like a hug on a chilly day. I've been experimenting with different yarns, and I'm excited to share my findings. Have you tried baby alpaca before? What's your go-to yarn for cozy accessories?
