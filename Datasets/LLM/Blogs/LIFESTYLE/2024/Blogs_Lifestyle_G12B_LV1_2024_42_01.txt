## The Space Between: Finding Calm in a Frenzy

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily a simple commute can unravel your entire mood. I was driving home last week, feeling pretty good actually, when this car decided my existence was an affront. Tailgating. Seriously, *right* on my bumper. No reason, no need – just pure, aggressive impatience.

It instantly spiked my anxiety. I found myself gripping the wheel, battling a rising tide of frustration. And then, I realized something. This wasn’t about *them*. It was about me letting their chaos dictate my peace. 

2024 feels like everyone's perpetually rushing, demanding more, pushing harder. But that space – that safe distance – isn’t just for driving. It’s for our mental well-being too. It’s about setting boundaries, refusing to let others crowd our emotional space. I took a deep breath, let them pass, and the tension melted away. Small victories, right? Sometimes, all it takes is recognizing the space between.
