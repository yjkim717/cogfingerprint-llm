## That Lingering Feeling... and the Paxlovid Question

It’s weird, isn't it? How things aren't quite "normal" yet, even in 2024? I thought we’d be further past the shadow of COVID by now.  I tested negative a week ago – huge sigh of relief, right? – but I'm still feeling… off. A persistent cough, a general heaviness, and the kind of fatigue that makes even making a cup of tea feel like a monumental effort. 

Honestly, it feels a bit like a persistent URI, but that shortness of breath keeps nagging at me.  It’s subtle, but it’s *there*.  My brain keeps circling back to that whole Paxlovid rebound thing.  I know, I know, I tested negative. But is it worth considering another round, just to be sure this isn’t a sneaky, delayed reaction? 

It's frustrating.  You want to just *move on*, to feel like you're truly past it. But this lingering feeling is a reminder that COVID isn't always a clean break. Anyone else still wrestling with this?  I'm genuinely curious to hear your experiences.
