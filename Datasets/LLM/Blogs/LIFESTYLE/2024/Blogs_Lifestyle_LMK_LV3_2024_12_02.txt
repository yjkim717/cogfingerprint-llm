"Finding Comfort with CPAP: My Beard, My Sleep Apnea, and Me"

As I navigate life with sleep apnea in 2024, I've been struggling to find the perfect CPAP mask that works for me - and my beard. I've been using a nasal mask, but I've been told that a full face mask might be a better option since I tend to breathe through my mouth at night. The big question is, will it work with my beard? I've heard mixed reviews, and I'm hesitant to give up my facial hair. I've tried shaving it off, but it's just not me. I'm hoping to find a solution that lets me keep my beard while still getting a good night's sleep. If you're a fellow bearded sleep apnea sufferer, I'd love to hear your advice. Have you made the switch to a full face mask? Did it work for you? Let's figure this out together.
