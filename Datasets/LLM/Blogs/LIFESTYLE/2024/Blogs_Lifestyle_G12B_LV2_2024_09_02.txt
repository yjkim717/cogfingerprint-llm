## That Strange Rumble...and a Moment to Pause

Did anyone else in Sydney feel that little tremor yesterday? It was just a brief rumble, but it definitely stopped me in my tracks. My cup rattled, and for a split second, a weird feeling of unease settled in. It got me thinking – how often do we actually *pause* amidst the daily rush? We’re all striving, busy, connected… but maybe a little shake is a reminder to ground ourselves, appreciate the present, and just breathe. Anyone else feeling reflective today?
