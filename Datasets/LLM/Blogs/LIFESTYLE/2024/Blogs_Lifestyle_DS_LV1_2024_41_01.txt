It’s 2024, and I’m still trying to curate my digital space like a zen garden. The other day, scrolling through Reddit’s Latest feed on my phone, a jarring, NSFW post from a subreddit I’d never joined popped up. It felt like a loud commercial interrupting a quiet moment. It struck me how our attention is the new frontier, constantly under siege. So, I’ve started actively blocking what doesn’t serve my peace. It’s a small act, but protecting my mental real estate feels like the ultimate modern lifestyle choice.
