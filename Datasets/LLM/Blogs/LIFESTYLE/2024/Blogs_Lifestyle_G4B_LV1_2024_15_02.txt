**The Digital Black Hole of Football Tickets**

Anyone else feel like the internet is just… increasingly frustrating sometimes? I was trying to snag an away ticket for Sheffield United this season – a proper season ticket, you know, the badge of honour – and ended up in a right pickle. The whole ‘eticketing’ process felt like throwing a digital dart into a black hole. 

I clicked, I paid, I expected a confirmation, a little email saying “Yep, your ticket’s on its way!” Nothing. Just silence. It’s a bizarre feeling, that quiet disappointment when a simple transaction goes sideways. It made me think about how reliant we’ve become on these systems, and how easily we can get lost in them.  Maybe I need to rediscover the joy of a phone call and a real person!  Anyone else had similar ticketing nightmares this year?
