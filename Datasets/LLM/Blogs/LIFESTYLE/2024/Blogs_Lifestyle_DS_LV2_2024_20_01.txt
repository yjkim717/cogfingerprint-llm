There I was, wandering the cobblestone streets of Milan, my $500 budget feeling both liberating and limiting. I’d dreamed of finding that perfect leather bag—something timeless, yet uniquely Italian. Then, in a small boutique tucked away from the tourist bustle, I found it: a supple mid-range tote and a delicate, hand-beaded clutch. It wasn’t just a purchase; it was a lesson in seeking quality over quantity. Now, every time I carry them, I’m transported back to that sunny Italian afternoon, a cherished memory I can literally hold in my hands.
