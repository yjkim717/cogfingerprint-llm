After five years of quiet companionship, my P. saundersii has become more than just a plant—it’s a living diary of patience. Its caudex has thickened, but the sparse branches felt like untold stories. So, I took a deep breath and made the cut, snipping low to encourage new branching. It’s a leap of faith, shaping this specimen into a bonsai-like vision. In 2024, maybe we all need to trim back to grow fuller. Any fellow plant lovers with tips for this next chapter?
