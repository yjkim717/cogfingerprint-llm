**The Digital Panic We All Know**

It’s 2024, and you’d think we’d be used to this. But there I was, heart pounding, staring at a frozen screen. The spinning wheel of doom. I’d just clicked “confirm” on a precious away ticket, the final step after a frantic ten minutes.

Then, nothing. The website crashed.

My mind raced. Did it go through? I had no email confirmation, no order reference to cling to. I was just a season ticket holder lost in the digital void, my eTicketing profile feeling more like a ghost town than a gateway.

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple glitch can send us spiraling. That gut-wrenching moment of potential loss over something we haven’t even physically held. It’s a modern anxiety I never knew I’d have to master.
