>## The Forgotten Friend and the Art of Second Chances

It's a little embarrassing to admit, but I have a plant friend who’s been… neglected. A *P. saundersii*, to be precise. Five years ago, I was all enthusiasm, envisioning a miniature, gnarled masterpiece, a living sculpture worthy of a bonsai exhibit. Life, as it tends to do, intervened. Work got demanding, travel beckoned, and suddenly, my little succulent sat forgotten in a corner, gathering dust and silently judging my priorities.

Looking at it now, it’s… interesting. A thick, imposing caudex – that swollen base – has developed, a testament to its resilience. But the branching? Let's just say it’s a bit chaotic. 

It's got me thinking about a lot more than just pruning. This plant is a mirror reflecting my own tendency to let things slide, to lose sight of nurturing what I initially set out to cultivate. Maybe 2024 is the year for second chances – for the *P. saundersii*, and maybe, for a few other areas of my life too. Time to grab the shears and see what beauty can be coaxed from a little neglect and a whole lot of intention.
