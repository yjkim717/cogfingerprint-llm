**The Art of the Better Deal**

It’s funny how a simple phone call can make you re-evaluate your entire approach to spending. Just last week, I was on the line with Virgin Media. They presented their “final” retention offer: £29 a month. A year ago, I’d have snapped their hand off.

But something in me paused. I’d just spent twenty minutes on a comparison website, shocked at how my mobile contract had silently crept up in price. That moment of clarity made me bold. I politely declined.

Hanging up felt risky, but it was liberating. It wasn’t just about broadband; it was about refusing to accept the path of least resistance. In 2024, being a savvy consumer isn’t just smart—it’s a form of self-respect. The best deal isn’t always the one they offer you first; it’s the one you empower yourself to go and find.
