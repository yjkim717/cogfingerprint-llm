During my recent layover at LAX, I had a choice: try Turo for a quick trip to Yorba Linda or stick with a traditional rental. I’d heard great things about peer-to-peer car sharing, but with limited time, I went with Avis. It was seamless—no waiting, no coordination. Sometimes, the simplest option fits a busy lifestyle best. In 2024, it’s easy to get caught up in trends, but efficiency often wins. Lesson learned: streamline where you can, so you have more energy for what truly matters.
