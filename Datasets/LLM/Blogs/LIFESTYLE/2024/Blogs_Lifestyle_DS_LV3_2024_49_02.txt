There’s a scene in an old episode of *Friends* where the whole gang is just hanging out in their favorite coffee shop, laughing about something trivial. I rewatched it recently and felt a pang of something—not quite nostalgia, but a quiet question: are friendships like that even possible anymore?

I had a taste of it once. During my Erasmus year, my flatmates and I were inseparable. We’d cook disastrous meals together, stay up all night talking about everything and nothing, and navigate a new country as a tight-knit unit. It felt real, unscripted, and deep—the kind of connection TV writers dream up.

But back in 2024, life has a different pace. My closest friends are now scattered across time zones. Our main thread is a chaotic group chat, punctuated by Instagram stories and the occasional video call. We’re all busy building careers, managing responsibilities, and trying to stay afloat. I treasure these people, but I miss the easy, constant presence. The shared, mundane moments that used to weave our lives together.

It makes me wonder—have our modern, hyper-connected lifestyles ironically made true friendship more fragile? We have more ways to talk, yet sometimes it feels like we’re talking *at* our lives instead of living them side-by-side.

Maybe the magic of those TV friendships isn't the grand gestures, but the simple, consistent showing up. And perhaps that’s the challenge—and the invitation—for our generation: to be more intentional about creating that space for each other, even when life gets loud.
