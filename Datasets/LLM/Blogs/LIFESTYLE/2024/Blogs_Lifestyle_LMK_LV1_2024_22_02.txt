"Investing on the Go: A Frustrating Lesson in Adaptability

As I sat sipping my morning coffee in January 2024, I was caught off guard when I tried to buy fractional shares of VTI through my Vanguard brokerage account, only to be met with an error message. I was certain I had done this a thousand times before, but suddenly it wasn't working. I refreshed the page, checked my account balance, and even tried again on my mobile app - still nothing. Thirty minutes of frustration later, it magically resolved itself. I was relieved, but also left wondering: was it just a blip on Vanguard's website, or had they changed their policy on fractional shares without warning? As I reflected on the experience, I realized that investing is not just about numbers - it's about adapting to the unexpected twists and turns that come our way. And sometimes, that means taking a deep breath and waiting for the system to catch up."
