## LinkedIn & Franchise Dreams: A Little Lost (and a Lot Curious)

Anyone else feel like LinkedIn is a constant stream of unexpected opportunities these days? I recently got a message from Franocity, a franchise consulting firm, and it’s got me thinking. As a small business owner already juggling a million things, the idea of exploring franchising is… intriguing, to say the least. I'm definitely doing my research and would love to hear from anyone who's used a franchise consultant, especially in 2024. What were your experiences? Any advice for a curious entrepreneur?
