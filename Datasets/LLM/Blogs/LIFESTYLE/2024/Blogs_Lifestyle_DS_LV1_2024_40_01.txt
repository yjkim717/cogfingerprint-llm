### The Duncan Idaho in All of Us: On Being the Reluctant Successor

I was cleaning out my closet last weekend—a classic 2024 attempt to manufacture a sense of order—when I found it. Tucked behind a box of old cables was a notebook from my first “real” job after college. Flipping through it was like meeting a ghost. There were frantic to-do lists, notes from meetings where I understood maybe half of what was being said, and a recurring, anxious question scribbled in the margins: “What am I even doing here?”

It hit me then. I was a Duncan Idaho.

Let me explain, because this isn’t about sci-fi. It’s about a feeling many of us have experienced. In Frank Herbert’s *Dune*, Duncan Idaho is this incredibly skilled, loyal warrior. He dies, is reborn over and over (as a ghola), and finds himself serving a God Emperor—a prescient, millennia-old ruler who sees the future in a way no one else can. Duncan’s ultimate, world-changing role is to be the Emperor’s witness, his successor, and, paradoxically, the one who must eventually end his reign.

Now, I’m not saying my old boss was a giant worm-man with a sacred plan for humanity. But haven’t you ever been in a situation—a job, a relationship, a family dynamic—where you felt like you were playing a part in someone else’s grand, inscrutable vision? You’re the loyal, capable one, trusted with immense responsibility, yet you feel like a piece being moved on a chessboard. You’re following a path laid out by someone with more experience, more power, or simply a stronger will. That’s the “fishspeaker” phase—the loyal soldier executing a plan you didn’t design.

The magic, and the terror, of Duncan’s story is what happens next. The “prescience” of the leader—be it a boss’s business plan or a parent’s life script for you—can only take things so far. It’s rigid. It can’t account for the messy, beautiful, and unpredictable spark of a true individual. The system, however perfect, eventually needs to be broken open by something new. That’s you, stepping out of the role assigned to you.

This is the moment of becoming the “successor.” It’s not about a hostile takeover. It’s about the quiet, internal rebellion where you stop being a reflection of someone else’s vision and start trusting your own. It’s leaving that secure job to start a pottery studio. It’s finally setting that boundary with a loved one. It’s looking at the “Golden Path” laid out for you and saying, “Thanks, but I’m going to walk my own, even if it’s a little rougher.”

Finding that old notebook was like looking at my own ghola—a previous version of myself, brought back to life just to remind me how far I’ve come. We are all, in a sense, constantly being reborn through our experiences. We serve, we learn, we witness, and if we’re brave, we eventually have to “kill” the old structures that no longer serve our growth.

So, look around. Where are you being the loyal soldier? And where is it time for you to pick up the blade of your own judgment and become the emperor of your life? The universe, it turns out, doesn’t need another perfect follower. It’s waiting for you to become the reluctant, necessary successor to your own story.
