"Embracing a New Chapter in Clinton, NY: A Family's Journey" 

As we stood at the crossroads of a major life decision, my family and I found ourselves drawn to the charming town of Clinton, New York. The promise of a job opportunity was enticing, but we knew that relocating to upstate New York would require more than just a leap of faith. We craved a glimpse into the lifestyle that awaited us. Would Hamilton College's presence in the town mean a vibrant community? How would our children adjust to the local schools? As we weighed our options, we discovered that Clinton's natural beauty, rich history, and tight-knit community made it the perfect haven for our family. In 2024, we're trading in the chaos for a more balanced lifestyle, and we're excited to see what the future holds.
