**A Little Piece of Ukraine**

It’s funny how things resurface, isn’t it? I was clearing out a box last week and unearthed a small, wooden carving – a hockey stick. Suddenly, a flood of memories from a trip to Europe back in 2018. We’d spent a week with some incredible Ukrainian hockey players, and this was a little gift they’d given me.  

Now, years later, I’m utterly captivated by its origin. It’s a tiny reminder of unexpected connections and a beautiful, poignant piece of my past.  It makes me wonder about the stories behind these simple gifts.
