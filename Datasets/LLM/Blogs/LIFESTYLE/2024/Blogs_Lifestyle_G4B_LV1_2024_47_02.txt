**Building a Better Me, One Tiny Habit at a Time**

Okay, let's be honest – 2024 feels like a year of *trying*. Trying to eat healthier, trying to be more productive, trying to actually *enjoy* my evenings instead of scrolling endlessly. It’s exhausting! Then I stumbled across James Clear’s “Atomic Habits,” and suddenly, it felt less like a monumental task and more like…well, building a house, brick by tiny brick.

The core idea – habit stacking – really resonated. Instead of setting massive goals ("I’m going to run a marathon!"), it’s about attaching new habits to existing ones. So now, after I brush my teeth (a habit!), I do five minutes of stretching. Small, but it’s *something*.

I’ve been digging into the concept of identity-based habits too. It’s not just about *doing* things, but *becoming* a certain type of person. I’m trying to picture myself as someone who consistently reads, so I’m aiming for just 10 pages a day – the “1% rule” Clear talks about. 

It’s all about the cue-routine-reward loop, really. The cue (my teeth brushing), the routine (stretching), and the reward (a little bit of movement and feeling slightly less stiff!). 

Honestly, it's not always smooth sailing. There are days I completely miss a stack. But the key, Clear argues, is consistency, not perfection. And right now, that’s enough for me.  What tiny habits are you building this year?
