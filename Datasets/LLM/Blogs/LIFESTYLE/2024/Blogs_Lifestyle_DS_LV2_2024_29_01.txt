There’s a certain kind of book that doesn’t just end when you close the cover—it lingers, coloring your thoughts for days. For me, that was *Homegoing*. Finishing that generational saga last week left me with the mother of all reading hangovers.

It’s 2024, and my life is a whirlwind of notifications and to-do lists. But that story about a family’s legacy, stretched across centuries, forced me to slow down. It made me look at my own family’s simple heirlooms—my grandmother’s recipe book, my dad’ old watch—with new weight. What stories do they hold? What quiet impacts have they had on who I am today?

It was a powerful reminder that in our fast-paced world, the most profound connection is sometimes found not in looking forward, but in understanding what, and who, came before us.
