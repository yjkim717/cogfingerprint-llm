**The City Called to Me Again**

It feels a little strange admitting this, but I’ve been thinking a lot about the Great Rural Escape of 2020 and 2021. For a while, everyone seemed to be flocking to the countryside – tiny villages, sprawling farms, the whole nine yards.  I even considered it myself.  But lately, something’s shifted. 

I was scrolling through Instagram the other day, and it hit me: London is *buzzing* again. Not just the usual frantic energy, but a real sense of excitement, of people rediscovering the pull of the city.  It’s funny, isn’t it? After years of craving quiet and space, I’m feeling a pull back towards the concrete jungle. 

Maybe it's a reaction to the stillness, a need for the constant hum of activity. Or perhaps it's just a recognition that life isn’t about choosing *one* place, but about finding where you feel most alive – whether that's a small town, a rural village, or a big city like London.  What’s pulling *you* lately?
