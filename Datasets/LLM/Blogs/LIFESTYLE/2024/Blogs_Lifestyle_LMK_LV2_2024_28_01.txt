As I geared up for my 2024 cycling adventure, I hit a roadblock: Schwalbe discontinued my go-to 27.5 touring tires and latex tubes. I began searching for alternatives, exploring 650b options and tubeless setups. The quest led me to reflect on my cycling lifestyle - the freedom, the thrill, and the joy. I'm not just replacing tires; I'm rediscovering my passion. Join me as I navigate this journey and find new wheels that fit my wandering spirit.
