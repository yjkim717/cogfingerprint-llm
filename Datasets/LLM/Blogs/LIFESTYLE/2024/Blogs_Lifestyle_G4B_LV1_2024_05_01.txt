**A Little Piece of Ukraine**

It’s funny what trips can unearth. Last summer, while visiting my sister in Canada, I found a small wooden carving – a hockey player, actually – tucked away in an old box. Turns out, it was a gift from a Ukrainian hockey team she’d played with years ago, a memento from a family trip they’d taken together. Holding it, I felt a sudden, unexpected connection to a past I barely knew, a little piece of Ukrainian history and friendship. It’s amazing how objects can spark memories.
