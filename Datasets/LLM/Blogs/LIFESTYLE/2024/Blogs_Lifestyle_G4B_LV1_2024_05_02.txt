**Reclaiming the Wild Within**

It’s funny, isn’t it? I’ve been wrestling with feeling…stunted lately, like a plant desperately needing sunlight. Then I started looking after this neglected *P. saundersii* – a massive, almost forgotten caudex. Just like it, I felt a bit overgrown and tangled. 

I’m starting to prune away the excess, carefully encouraging new growth and a stronger core. It’s a small act, really, but it feels like a metaphor for letting go of what’s holding me back.  Maybe this bonsai project is exactly what I need to bloom. 2024, let’s grow!
