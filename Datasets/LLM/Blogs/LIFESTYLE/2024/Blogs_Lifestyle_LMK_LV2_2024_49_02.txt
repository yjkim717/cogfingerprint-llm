"Real Friends, Unreal Expectations"

As I binge-watched my favorite TV shows during the pandemic, I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia for the friendships I saw on screen. Shows like Friends and How I Met Your Mother portrayed tight-knit groups of friends who were always there for each other, no matter what. I found myself wondering: are these friendships realistic?

As I reflect on my own life, I realize that my friendships are just as meaningful, but not always as seamless. In reality, maintaining friendships takes work. Life gets busy, and sometimes months go by before we catch up with our closest friends. But when we do, it feels like no time has passed at all.

In 2024, it's easier than ever to stay connected with others through social media. Yet, I've come to realize that online connections can sometimes create unrealistic expectations. We see our friends' curated highlight reels and feel like we're not measuring up. But the truth is, everyone has their own struggles and imperfections.

TV shows like Friends may not accurately depict the daily grind of maintaining friendships, but they do capture the essence of what it means to have people who truly care about you. As I navigate my own friendships, I'm learning to appreciate the imperfect, real-life moments we share, rather than comparing them to some idealized version on screen. By embracing the ups and downs of friendship, I'm cultivating more authentic and meaningful connections with the people in my life.
