## The Quest for Seamless VR: My Router Upgrade Story

Okay, so I’m officially admitting defeat – my gaming setup was fighting me. My PC sits tucked away in the office, while my VR headset (Oculus Quest, naturally!) lives in the living room. The connection was… choppy, to put it mildly. Lots of lag, frustrating disconnects. It felt like I was battling the digital world instead of enjoying it!

Turns out, a decent wireless router was the missing piece. After some Reddit deep dives and a bit of research (Wifi 6 and Wifi 6e were buzzwords I had to quickly learn!), I finally upgraded. The difference is incredible! Suddenly, exploring virtual worlds feels truly immersive. It’s a small upgrade, but it's seriously upped my entertainment game and reminded me that sometimes, the best experiences need a little tech TLC.
