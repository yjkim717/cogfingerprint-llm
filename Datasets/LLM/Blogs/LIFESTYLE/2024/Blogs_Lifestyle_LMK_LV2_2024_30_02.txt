As I prep for my Labor Day drone adventure in 2024, I'm stuck on one thing - can I fly near the airport with just a LAANC approval? As a recreational drone user, I've always been keen on following the FAA drone rules. I've got my Part 107 certificate, but I'm not sure if that's enough. I've heard LAANC authorization is the way to go for flying near airports, but I want to make sure I'm doing it right. I'm itching to capture some epic shots during my vacation, but safety comes first. After digging through the regulations, I'm still unsure - is LAANC approval alone sufficient, or do I need to take extra steps? I wish I had some clarity on this before I head out to fly. Hopefully, I'll get the confirmation I need and make the most of my drone flying experience.
