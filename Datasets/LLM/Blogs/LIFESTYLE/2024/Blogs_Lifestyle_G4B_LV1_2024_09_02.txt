**The Ground Still Shakes a Little**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Last week, I felt this sudden, unsettling rumble – a little earth tremor, really. Immediately, I thought of that new railway line construction and the rumors of drilling nearby. It made me think about how sensitive we are to changes, even subtle ones.  Living so close to industry, you start noticing the vibrations, the little shifts.  It's a reminder to appreciate the quiet moments, and maybe, just maybe, to question what’s happening beneath our feet.
