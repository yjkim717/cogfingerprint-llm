As I navigate my busy 2024 life, I'm on the hunt for an Android app that simplifies adding calendar events. Ideally, it would let me scan images or use voice input to create entries, and choose the calendar too. With the right tool, I'd streamline my scheduling and free up time for what matters. Is there an app out there that can make my life easier?
