It’s funny how a small change—like Schwalbe discontinuing my favorite 650b touring tires—can make you pause and reflect. In 2024, we’re all chasing durability, aren’t we? Not just in gear, but in habits, relationships, the paths we ride daily. Maybe it’s a sign to adapt, to try something new, even if it means swapping tubeless for trusty latex tubes. Life, like cycling, isn’t about the perfect setup, but the resilience to keep rolling, whatever the road throws at you.
