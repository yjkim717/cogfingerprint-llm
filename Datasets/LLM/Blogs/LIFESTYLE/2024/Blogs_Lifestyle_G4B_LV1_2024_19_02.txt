**LVP & the Bathroom Blues**

Okay, so I’m seriously contemplating a bathroom refresh this year. I’m leaning towards LVP – it seems so durable and modern. But I’m wrestling with a tiny detail: staggering the boards. It feels fussy, right?  Part of me wants a perfectly neat, grid-like look, but another part is craving a bit of relaxed, lived-in charm.  Anyone else battling this little DIY dilemma? #LVP #bathroomdesign #homeimprovement 2024
