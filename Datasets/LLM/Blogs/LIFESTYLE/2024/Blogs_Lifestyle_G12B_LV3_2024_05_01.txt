 Hugs and Hockey Sticks: A Little Slice of Ukraine

It's funny how memories resurface. I was clearing out the attic last week and stumbled upon a small, hand-painted hockey charm â€“ a gift from a group of Ukrainian junior hockey players we hosted back in the early 2010s. It's utterly useless, really, but holding it instantly floods me with warmth and reminds me of their laughter and our shared, fleeting connection. Some gifts are priceless, aren't they?
