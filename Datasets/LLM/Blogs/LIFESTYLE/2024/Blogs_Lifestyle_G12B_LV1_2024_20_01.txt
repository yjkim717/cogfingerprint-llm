## The Unexpected Charm of Vicenza & a New Leather Treasure

This year’s trip to Northern Italy was shaping up to be all about the big names – Milan, Venice, Florence. But a spontaneous detour to Vicenza completely stole the show. It’s a city that whispers rather than shouts, and that’s exactly what I needed. 

I was on the hunt for a simple, well-made leather bag, something to carry daily, and stumbled upon a tiny workshop tucked away on a quiet side street. The artisan, a lovely older gentleman, patiently showed me his craft. I ended up leaving with a gorgeous, perfectly-sized bag, and a beaded clutch I couldn't resist. It’s amazing how a small city can hold such beautiful, handcrafted treasures – a reminder to slow down and embrace the unexpected.
