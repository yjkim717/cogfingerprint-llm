It’s funny how a simple thing like figuring out weekly parking in Provincetown can unravel my whole vacation plan. My parents are coming to visit, and their anxiety is contagious—suddenly, I’m scouring maps and rates, trying to soothe worries before they even arrive. It reminds me that travel isn’t just about destinations; it’s about the quiet effort to make space, literally and emotionally, for the people we love.
