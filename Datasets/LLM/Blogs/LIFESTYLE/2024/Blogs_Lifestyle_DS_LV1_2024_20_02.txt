But last week, I spent hours crafting a Canva slideshow for a personal project, only to watch my progress vanish—not once, but twice. A shaky internet connection and no quick way to get help left me staring at a blank screen, my work gone. It was a frustrating reminder that even in our hyper-connected world, we’re sometimes just one glitch away from losing precious time and creativity.
