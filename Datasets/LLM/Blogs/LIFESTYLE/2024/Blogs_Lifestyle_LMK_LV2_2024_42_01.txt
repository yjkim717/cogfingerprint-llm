"Tailgating: A Frustrating Reality on Our Roads"

As I navigated through the crowded highways in 2024, I couldn't help but feel a surge of frustration every time I glanced in my rearview mirror to see a car tailgating me. It's infuriating, especially when you're not the one causing the slowdown. Maintaining a safe distance from the car in front is just common sense, yet many drivers seem to disregard this basic rule.

I've noticed that tailgating often goes hand-in-hand with aggressive driving and road rage. It's as if some drivers feel that speeding up and tailgating will magically make the traffic disappear. But it doesn't. All it does is put everyone on the road at risk. As I drive, I make a conscious effort to stay calm and maintain a safe distance. I wish more drivers would do the same. Let's all take a deep breath and drive defensively â€“ it's a simple step towards a safer, less stressful commute.
