It’s funny how the smallest home projects can turn into moments of reflection. Last week, I decided to upgrade our dining room lighting with a sleek new dimmer switch—a Lutron DVELV-300P, to be exact. As I stood there, peering into the switch box with wires staring back at me, I realized it wasn’t just about electrical installation. It was about creating atmosphere, about those quiet dinners where soft light makes all the difference. Finding that neutral wire felt like connecting more than circuits; it was about grounding our home in comfort and safety. In 2024, we’re all seeking control over our spaces, and sometimes, it starts with one mindful tweak at a time.
