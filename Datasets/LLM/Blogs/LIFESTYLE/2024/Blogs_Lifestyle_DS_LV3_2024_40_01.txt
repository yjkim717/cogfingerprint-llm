Of all the lessons I’ve tried to absorb from self-help books and productivity podcasts, none has stuck with me quite like the one I found buried in a dog-eared science fiction novel: the story of Duncan Idaho.

For those who haven’t wandered the deserts of Frank Herbert’s *Dune*, Duncan is a ghola—a clone, resurrected again and again. He serves a near-godlike ruler, Leto II, who can see the future with such clarity that the entire human race becomes a single, predictable script. To shatter this stagnation, Leto relies on Duncan. Not for his obedience, but for his beautiful, chaotic, and utterly unpredictable humanity. Duncan is the wild card, the one variable the prescience cannot fully account for.

And isn't that the most relatable struggle of our 2024 existence?

We are all, in our own ways, trying to predict and control our futures. We have algorithms that tell us what to buy, apps that optimize our sleep, and calendars so meticulously planned they feel like a foretold destiny. We’ve become the architects of our own golden paths, seeking comfort in the illusion of a predictable, risk-free life. We are building our own Leto II, a fortress of routine designed to protect us from the terrifying sandworms of uncertainty.

But in doing so, we risk losing our inner Duncan Idaho.

Our "Duncan" is that spontaneous part of us. It’s the last-minute decision to take a different route home, the impulse to call an old friend, the crazy idea for a project that defies all logical career planning. It’s the part that feels most authentically *us*, yet it’s the first thing we silence in the name of productivity and security. We surround ourselves with our own "Fish Speakers"—the rigid routines and unquestioned habits that enforce our self-made order, protecting the status quo but also walling us off from the very surprises that make us feel alive.

I had a small Duncan moment last month. My schedule was a monument to efficiency, every hour accounted for. But on my way to the gym, a route I’ve driven a thousand times, I passed a small sign for a community pottery class. On a whim, a pure, un-prescribed whim, I turned the car around. For two hours, I wasn’t a project manager or a planner. I was just a person with terribly lopsided lumps of clay, laughing with strangers. That tiny, unpredictable act of creation, that rebellion against my own schedule, injected more genuine energy into my week than any perfectly executed workout ever could.

This is the profound truth Leto II understood: a future that is perfectly safe is a future that is already dead. True resilience, the kind that allows for growth and discovery, isn’t born from flawless plans. It’s forged in our ability to be reborn—to become gholas of our own lives. It’s about having the loyalty to our core self to occasionally shatter the patterns we’ve so carefully built.

So, as you look at your own meticulously crafted life, ask yourself: Where is your Duncan Idaho? What small, unpredictable act of humanity can you introduce to your script today? Go for a walk without a destination. Talk to a stranger. Try to make a terrible pot. In a world pushing us toward absolute predictability, our greatest power is our beautiful,
