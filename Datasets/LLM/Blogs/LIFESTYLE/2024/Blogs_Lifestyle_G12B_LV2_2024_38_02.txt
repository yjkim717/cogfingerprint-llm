## The Unexpected Calm of Canvas and Stars

There’s something about the scent of pine needles and damp earth that instantly resets everything. I recently got a message from someone planning their first camping trip to Acadia – a tent newbie! It sparked a memory of my own shaky first setup, wrestling with poles and feeling utterly out of my element. 

But then, the quiet settled in. Just the crackle of the fire and the vastness of the stars. It’s a reminder that disconnecting, even for a weekend, is vital. We chase productivity and “doing,” but sometimes, the most valuable thing we can do is simply *be* – under a canvas roof, far from the glow of screens. Anyone else find that unexpected calm in the wilderness?



I hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
