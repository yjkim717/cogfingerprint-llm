"As I wandered through Northern Italy in 2024, I discovered that shopping for leather bags is an art form. From Milan's mid-range handbags to the beaded clutches of Sicily, Italian fashion stole my heart. If you're seeking stylish yet affordable leather goods, I recommend exploring local boutiques and markets. Not only will you find unique pieces, but you'll also experience the rich culture and craftsmanship that Italy is renowned for."
