### The Unlikely Travel Agent: My Drone

I almost left my little drone, “Autopylot,” in the closet for this year’s big vacation. Our rental was right on the edge of a no-fly zone, and I’d always assumed getting authorization was a bureaucratic maze for licensed pros. I’m just a recreational pilot who loves capturing sunsets.

But a week before the trip, a bit of late-night research changed everything. I discovered I could get instant LAANC authorization right from an app on my phone. No Part 107 certificate needed for what I wanted to do. It felt like finding a secret door in a room I’d been in for years.

That simple “yes” from the digital trust certificate was my travel agent, unlocking a perspective I’d never had. The resulting photos—waves crashing against the shore with the distant airport lights twinkling safely in the background—are my favorites. They’re a beautiful reminder that sometimes, the permission we need to live more fully is easier to get than we think.
