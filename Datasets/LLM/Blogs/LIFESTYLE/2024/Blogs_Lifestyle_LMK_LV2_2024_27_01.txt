Here is a reflective blog post:

"Rejection stung, but it taught me a valuable lesson. As an MBA holder, I'd faced my share of tough job interviews, but a qualitative-heavy take-home assignment was my downfall. In 2024, I'm still reflecting on that experience. I've learned to not be too hard on myself and to view rejections as stepping stones to success. It's a mindset shift that's helped me navigate life's ups and downs with more ease and resilience."
