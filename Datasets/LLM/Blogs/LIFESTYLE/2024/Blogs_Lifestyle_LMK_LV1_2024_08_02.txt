"Finding My Uniform: A Journey to Confident Workwear. As a sales director in the landscaping industry, I'm no stranger to getting my hands dirty. But, as a plus-sized woman, I've often struggled to find workwear that makes me feel both professional and confident. Between meeting with clients and getting out on site, my wardrobe needs to be versatile - not just stylish, but practical too. In 2024, I'm making a conscious effort to redefine what 'professional attire' means to me. I've started embracing outdoor-inspired pieces that can keep up with my active job, while still looking polished for meetings. It's been a game-changer. By prioritizing comfort and practicality, I've found a newfound confidence in my workwear. No longer am I held back by body image issues or limited by traditional notions of 'business attire.' I'm excited to see where this journey takes me - and I'm eager to share my discoveries with others who may be on a similar path."
