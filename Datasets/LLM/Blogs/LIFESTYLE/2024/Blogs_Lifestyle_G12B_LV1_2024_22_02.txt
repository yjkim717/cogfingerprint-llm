>## The Disappearing Option & The Unexpected Reset

It's funny, isn’t it, how technology can throw a tiny wrench into your plans and make you question everything? I was trying to add a little to my VTI holdings the other day – you know, chipping away at those long-term goals – and suddenly, the fractional share option was *gone*. Just… vanished.

My immediate thought was, "Vanguard changed something! Are they phasing this out? What does this *mean* for my strategy?" I spiraled for a good five minutes, imagining complex financial shifts and frantically searching their website. 

Turns out, it was just a glitch. A temporary hiccup in the system. And honestly? It was a good reminder. Sometimes, the things that feel like monumental shifts are just fleeting moments of digital chaos. 

It made me pause and reflect on how easily we get caught up in the "what ifs" and how often things work themselves out. A little digital reset, prompting a mental one too. Back to building that portfolio, one (whole or fractional!) share at a time.
