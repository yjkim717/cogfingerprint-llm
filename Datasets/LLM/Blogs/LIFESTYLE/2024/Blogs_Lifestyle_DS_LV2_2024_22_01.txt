It’s 2024, and I thought I’d put COVID firmly in the rearview mirror. But here I am, staring at yet another positive home test, weeks after my initial recovery. The fatigue and brain fog crept back in so suddenly—is this the infamous rebound I’ve read about?

Friends mentioned Paxlovid, and I’m tempted. Anything to shake this lingering exhaustion and feel like myself again. It’s a strange, frustrating loop: just when life starts feeling normal, a reminder pulls me back.

I’m left wondering—is this just a temporary setback, or the shadow of long COVID? Either way, it’s a stark lesson in patience and listening to my body, even when I’d rather be racing ahead.
