There’s a special kind of frustration that blooms in 2024 traffic, and it’s usually triggered by the driver glued to my bumper. I get it—we’re all in a hurry, all stressed, all trying to beat the clock. But when we’re boxed in by a sea of red taillights, that aggressive tailgating isn’t just annoying; it’s utterly pointless.

It’s in these moments I take a breath and hold my safe distance, a small act of defiance against the rush. I’m not just protecting my car; I’m protecting my peace. That frantic energy behind me? It solves nothing. All it does is turn a shared challenge into a solo, stupid race where everyone loses. So I drive on, calm in my bubble, hoping they eventually find a little patience—for their sake, and everyone else’s on the road.
