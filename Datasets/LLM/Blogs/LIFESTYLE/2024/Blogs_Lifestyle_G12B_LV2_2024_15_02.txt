## The Frustration of Waiting & Why Small Things Matter

Anyone else feel like 2024 is just…a *lot*? Between work, trying to squeeze in a workout, and just generally keeping up, it's easy to feel a little frazzled. This week, it was trying to snag an away ticket for Luton. Seriously, the Eticketing website decided to throw a proper wobble just as I was clicking 'confirm.' 

That little moment of digital frustration? It stuck with me. It’s not just about the ticket, is it? It's about the anticipation, the excitement of supporting the Hatters, and then suddenly…nothing. No confirmation email. A mini-crisis!

It made me think about how we often get so caught up in the big things, we forget how much the little hiccups affect our mood. Taking a breath, double-checking, and ultimately, contacting support – it’s a reminder to be patient, and to appreciate the simple joys, even when the tech isn't cooperating. Come on you Hatters, and come on, a little bit of calm in the chaos!
