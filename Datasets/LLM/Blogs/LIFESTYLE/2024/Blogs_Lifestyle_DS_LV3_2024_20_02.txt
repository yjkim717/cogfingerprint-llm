There I was, putting the final touches on my slideshow in Canva, a project that had consumed my entire afternoon. I clicked to save, but nothing happened. A refresh later, and hours of work were just… gone. The sinking feeling was immediate. In 2024, we trust these tools with our precious time, yet a single glitch can erase it all. The automated customer support loop offered no real solution, just a frustrating echo. It’s a stark reminder to back up our passion projects, because sometimes, the most modern tools can feel the most fragile.
