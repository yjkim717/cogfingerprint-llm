As I reflect on the powerful novel 'Homegoing' by Yaa Gyasi in 2024, I'm reminded that the shadows of our past linger, shaping our present. This historical fiction masterpiece weaves a poignant tale of a Ghanaian family's journey across eight generations, confronting the dark legacy of slavery and racism. It's a haunting reminder that intergenerational trauma is a weight we must acknowledge and work to heal from. As I navigate my own life, I'm inspired to break cycles of pain and foster a more compassionate, anti-racist world â€“ starting with the stories I share and the books I recommend.
