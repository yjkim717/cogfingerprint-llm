**Is My Computer Engineering Degree Worth It? (2024 Thoughts)**

Okay, real talk. As I’m staring down the barrel of graduation, a little voice keeps whispering, “Are you *sure* this was the right path?” I’m a computer engineering grad, and honestly, the job market feels…weird. I’m seeing incredible opportunities in data science and web development, fields that felt a million miles away during my coursework. 

It’s not that my degree is *bad*, it’s just… different. I spent so long focused on circuits and algorithms, and now I’m realizing the practical application feels a little fuzzy.  I’ve been talking to alumni, and a lot of us are exploring internships – even if it's to pivot. 

It’s a bit unsettling to feel like the skills I’ve poured years into might need a serious update. But, there's a weird excitement too, a chance to learn and adapt. Maybe this isn't about *what* I studied, but *how* I apply it.  Anyone else feeling this slightly anxious, slightly hopeful vibe?
