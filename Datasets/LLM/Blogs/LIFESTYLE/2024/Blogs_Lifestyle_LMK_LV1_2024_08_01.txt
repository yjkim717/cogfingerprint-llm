As I stepped off the bus at Belfast's Europa Buscentre in 2024, I felt a thrill of excitement. Navigating a new city can be daunting, but I was determined to make the most of my trip to Northern Ireland. I pondered my options: a scenic walk to my destination, a taxi, or a ride-hailing app. I opted for a stroll, soaking up the city's charm. Belfast's public transit had dropped me off right in the heart of things. As I wandered, I discovered hidden gems and felt a sense of freedom. Sometimes, the best way to experience a place is on foot.
