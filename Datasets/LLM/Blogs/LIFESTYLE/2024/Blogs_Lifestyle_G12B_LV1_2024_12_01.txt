## Trading Sparks for Bubbles: A Mid-Career Shift and the Allure of Commercial Diving

Okay, so here’s a slightly wild story. For the past eight years, I've been a data technician, knee-deep in servers and code, chasing deadlines and troubleshooting network glitches. It was… fine. Stable. Good money, even. But lately, "fine" just hasn’t felt enough. I’ve been staring at spreadsheets and thinking about the ocean. Seriously.

It started subtly, a quiet yearning for something different. I’ve always been a decent swimmer, always drawn to the water, but it grew into something more persistent. Then, a conversation with a friend, a welder on offshore rigs, really solidified it. He was talking about the cyclical nature of the work, the long stretches away from home, and the toll it takes. I realized I didn't *want* that life, even though the pay was good. I wanted something year-round, something tangible, something… wet.

Enter: commercial diving. 

It's a bit of a leap, I know. Trading logic gates for depths and currents. But the more I research, the more compelling it becomes. Aquaculture inspections, underwater construction, search and recovery… the possibilities are fascinating. I’m particularly intrigued by the connection to skilled trades unions like IBEW 213 – the prospect of union representation and training is a huge plus.

Right now, I'm sifting through different scuba diver courses, trying to figure out the best path. It’s daunting, to be honest. The training is intensive, the risks are real, but the potential for a fulfilling, hands-on career is incredibly exciting. 

It feels like I'm standing on the edge of something big. A complete career pivot. A chance to finally chase that feeling of being truly *engaged*. Wish me luck – I'm diving in! (Pun absolutely intended.)
