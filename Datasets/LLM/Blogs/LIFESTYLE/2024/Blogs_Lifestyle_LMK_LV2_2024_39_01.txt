As I stood in front of my cluttered vanity in 2024, I realized my beauty routine had become a reflection of my chaotic life. With the constant influx of new products, I'd lost sight of what truly mattered. I began to simplify, paring down my collection to essentials like nourishing lip balms and multitasking sunscreens. By streamlining my skincare and makeup routine, I freed up mental energy and discovered a sense of calm. Now, my daily beauty ritual is a meditative moment, a chance to reconnect with myself amidst life's chaos.
