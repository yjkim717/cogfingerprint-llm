It’s funny how a shared frustration can spark something truly wonderful. I’ve been feeling increasingly restless with the unpredictable nature of golf – those sudden aeration schedules, the impromptu course closures… it’s enough to make anyone’s game (and mood!) sour. That’s why I’m so excited about ‘Pure,’ this new free app a golfer built. 

It’s more than just a notification system; it’s building a community.  Sharing real-time feedback about course conditions, connecting with other players – it feels like a small, but powerful way to reclaim a bit of control and enjoy the game a little more.  2024 is already proving to be a year of finding joy in the small things, and this app definitely fits the bill.
