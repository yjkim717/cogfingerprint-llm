Navigating the VA system can be a wild ride. I just got a voicemail from QTC about my C&P appointment - seems it didn't process. Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm left wondering what's next for my claim. It's a frustrating detour, but I'm holding onto hope. Anyone have a similar experience? Let's compare notes and get through this together.
