It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking about the strange lines we draw. Last week, I winced at those marked-up concert tickets, cursing scalpers. Yet, just yesterday, I proudly snagged a “vintage” jacket for triple its original price. Why the disconnect? We accept—even celebrate—reselling in fashion and antiques, calling it curation. But with tickets, it feels like a betrayal. Maybe it’s because experiences feel more sacred than objects. Or perhaps we’re just inconsistent. Either way, it’s worth a little self-reflection, don’t you think?
