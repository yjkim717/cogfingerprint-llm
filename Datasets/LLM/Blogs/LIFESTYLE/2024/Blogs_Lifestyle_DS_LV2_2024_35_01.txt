It’s funny how a video game can mirror life’s little dilemmas. Just last night, I was staring at my screen in MLB The Show 2024, paralyzed by choice: dive into the competitive chaos of Ranked games, try my luck in Battle Royale, or grind Events for those sweet card rewards? It felt eerily familiar—like deciding whether to chase a promotion, switch careers, or just enjoy the slow, steady climb.

I realized, whether building a card collection or a life, it’s not about the fastest route, but the one that brings you joy. Sometimes, you just have to play the mode that feels right today.
