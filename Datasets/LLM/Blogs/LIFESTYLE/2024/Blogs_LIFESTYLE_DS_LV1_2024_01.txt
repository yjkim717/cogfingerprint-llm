### The In-Between Life: Finding a New Rhythm

It’s 2024, and I can still feel the ghost of my old city life—the frantic pace, the constant hum. When the world reopened, my partner and I did something we’d only ever joked about: we left. We didn’t go fully rural, but landed in a regenerating seaside town, a place with one foot in its fishing past and the other in a future of artisan coffee shops and co-working spaces.

I’ll admit, the first few months were strange. The silence was deafening. But then, something shifted. The daily race was replaced with a morning walk along the pier. The anonymous city crowd became a community of faces I actually know. We haven’t traded convenience for complete isolation; we’ve found a middle ground. It’s not a retreat from life, but a step towards a different kind of living—one that feels more intentional, more human. Maybe the sweet spot wasn't in the extremes, but in the vibrant, messy, and wonderfully balanced in-between.
