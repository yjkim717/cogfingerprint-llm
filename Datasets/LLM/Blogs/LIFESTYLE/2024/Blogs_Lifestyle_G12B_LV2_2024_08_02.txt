I've focused on the internal struggle and journey of finding a personal style that's authentic and confident.  I've included a couple of potential titles at the end.

## Finding My Ground: Style, Sales, and Self-Acceptance

It's funny, isn’t it, how our jobs end up shaping so much more than just our workday? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with something – how to show up as a sales director in the landscaping industry, and *still* feel like… me. 

I love what I do. I’m passionate about beautiful outdoor spaces, connecting with clients, and closing deals. But the traditional "office professional" look felt so… distant. Too stiff. Yet, rocking full-on hiking gear to a meeting? Probably not the best impression.

Then there’s the whole body image thing. Let’s be honest, it's a constant hum in the background, isn't it? Trying to find clothes that flatter, that feel good, that scream "confident leader" without screaming "trying too hard."

It's been a journey of experimentation. Linen shirts, well-fitting chinos, a touch of earthy jewelry. Pieces that feel authentic to my love of the outdoors, but polished enough to command a room. It’s not about chasing trends; it’s about finding what *I* feel good in. It’s a work in progress, a daily choice to embrace myself, flaws and all, and show up with genuine enthusiasm. And honestly? That’s a sale worth making.
