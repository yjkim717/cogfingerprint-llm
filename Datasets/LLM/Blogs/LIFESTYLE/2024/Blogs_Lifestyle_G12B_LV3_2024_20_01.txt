## The Hunt for the Perfect Italian Leather Bag (and a Little Piece of Italy to Carry Home)

Okay, so I'm planning a trip to Italy this fall – Northern and Southern adventures await! And like any good traveler, I'm already dreaming of souvenirs. But not the fridge magnets, please. I'm on a mission for a beautiful, genuine leather bag. Specifically, I’m picturing a gorgeous beaded clutch, something small and special to remember the trip by.

My budget? Around $500. I’m hoping to find some gems in places like Verona and Vicenza – I’ve heard the leather craftsmanship there is incredible. It's more than just a bag, really. It's about carrying a little piece of Italian artistry and the memories of cobbled streets and delicious pasta with me, long after I've returned. Any recommendations from those who've been? Let me know!
