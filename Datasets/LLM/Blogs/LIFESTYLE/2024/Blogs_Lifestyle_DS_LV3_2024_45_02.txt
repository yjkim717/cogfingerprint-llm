When Mint announced it was shutting down, I felt that familiar panic—where would my budget live? Taking a leap, I signed up for Monarch Money’s 30-day free trial, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer. The interface is clean, the insights are sharp, and that first-year discount made the switch a no-brainer. It’s more than a replacement; it’s the upgrade my personal finance routine didn’t know it needed. Sometimes, the end of one thing really is the start of something better.
