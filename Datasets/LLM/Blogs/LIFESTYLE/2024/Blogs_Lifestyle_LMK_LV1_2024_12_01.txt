As I sit here in 2024, reflecting on my journey so far, I realize that my passion for the underwater world has been a constant thread throughout my life. By day, I'm a data technician in the telecommunications industry, staring at screens and crunching numbers. But by night, I transform into a recreational diver, exploring the ocean's depths and marveling at its beauty. I still remember the rush I felt when I completed my scuba diver course a few years ago - it was like unlocking a whole new world.

Lately, I've been itching to take my passion to the next level. I've been considering enrolling in a commercial diving school to gain the skills and certifications needed to turn my hobby into a career. The prospect of working in aquaculture, seafood harvesting, or other non-welding fields is exciting, and I'm eager to explore the job prospects in these areas.

As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that it's never too late to make a change. At 35, I'm not getting any younger, but I'm still young enough to take the leap. I've heard that commercial diving schools can be intense, but I'm willing to put in the hard work if it means pursuing a career that aligns with my values and passions.

For anyone considering a similar path, I'd love to hear from you. What are your experiences with commercial diving schools? What job opportunities are out there for non-welders? Let's dive into the conversation and explore the possibilities together.
