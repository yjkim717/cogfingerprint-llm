**The Ghost of a Presentation**

There’s a strange feeling, isn’t there? Like a digital ghost haunting your workflow. I recently had a really unsettling experience with Canva – hours of work on a slideshow vanished into thin air. It wasn’t just a minor inconvenience; it triggered a wave of frustration and a real sense of helplessness.  And then, trying to get help from customer support felt like shouting into a void.

It’s a frustrating feeling, definitely one I’m still processing.
