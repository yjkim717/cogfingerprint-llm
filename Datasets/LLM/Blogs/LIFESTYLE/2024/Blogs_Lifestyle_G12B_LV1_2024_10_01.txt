>## Saturdays & Small Victories

It's Saturday, and that always brings a little extra weight, doesn't it? Not a bad weight, necessarily, but a feeling of…reflection. For me, lately, that reflection has been circling around the quiet victories of choosing a different path.

It's been nearly a year since I made the decision to prioritize sobriety, and honestly, some Saturdays still feel like a hurdle. The urge to slip back into old habits can be surprisingly strong. But then I remember the clarity I’ve gained, the energy I have, and the relationships I’ve rebuilt. 

This week, the victory was simple: saying "no" to a casual drink at a friend's barbeque. It wasn’t a grand declaration, just a small, honest choice. And it felt *good*. 

There's a beautiful strength in these small, consistent choices. It's a journey, not a destination, and I'm grateful for the support I've found along the way – connecting with others who understand that Saturday reflection, and the power of choosing yourself. What small victory are you celebrating this weekend?
