As I stood in my cluttered makerspace, surrounded by tangled wires and half-finished projects, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between 3D printing and life. My latest obsession was tweaking my Klipper setup to customize the G28Z location, so my printer would clean the nozzle before starting a print, rather than probing the center of the bed. It was a small victory, but it made me feel like I'd taken control of a tiny aspect of my chaotic world. In 2024, it feels like everything is speeding up, and it's easy to get lost in the noise. But in moments like these, when I'm fine-tuning my printer or watching a print come to life, I'm reminded that it's the small, incremental changes that can bring a sense of calm and purpose to our lives.
