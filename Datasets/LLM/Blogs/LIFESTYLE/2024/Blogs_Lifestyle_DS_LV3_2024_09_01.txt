There’s something quietly luxurious about taking a moment just for yourself in 2024, a year that still feels like it’s moving at light speed. For me, that pause often comes in the form of a steaming cup of rose-infused black tea. It’s a simple ritual, but it grounds me.

Recently, I decided to compare two beloved versions. On one side, Fortnum & Mason's Rose Pouchong—a mellow, velvety sip that feels like a warm, comforting embrace. It’s the tea you reach for when you need to slow down and be gentle with yourself.

Then there’s Bird & Blend’s Belle's Breakfast. This one is a brighter, almost fruitier celebration of rose. It feels lively and optimistic, the perfect companion for a morning when you’re ready to take on the world.

Choosing between them isn't about which is better, but about what my soul needs in that moment. In a world of constant noise, these small, fragrant choices become a beautiful form of self-care. What’s in your cup today?
