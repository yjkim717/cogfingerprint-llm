The glow of my laptop screen illuminates our temporary living room in Lisbon, while my daughter practices Portuguese with our Airbnb host. Three years ago, this scene would have seemed impossible. We were another high-earning couple trapped in the golden handcuffs of VHCOL cities, watching our children’s childhoods flash by in scheduled increments.

Then we asked the dangerous question: What if we stopped waiting?

Financial independence became our launchpad rather than our finish line. We reached FIRE not to retire from life, but to finally engage with it fully. We traded a sprawling suburban mortgage for a life of meaningful minimalism. Our home is wherever we unpack our bags, and our classroom has no walls.

Yesterday’s history lesson was discussing the Age of Exploration at the very docks where caravels once set sail. Math is calculating currency exchange at a local market. This nomadic rhythm isn’t about perpetual vacation; it’s about conscious living. It’s messy, unpredictable, and requires more flexibility than any corporate job ever demanded.

But watching our children navigate foreign metros and befriend kids in any language, I know we’re giving them something no elite school district ever could: the world itself as their curriculum, and the unshakable confidence that home isn’t a place you come from, but a feeling you carry with you.
