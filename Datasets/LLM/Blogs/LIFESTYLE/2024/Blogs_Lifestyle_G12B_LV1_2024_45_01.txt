>## The Unexpected Detour

Remember that feeling of having a *plan*? I definitely did, back in January. This year was supposed to be all about streamlining, efficiency, and finally launching that online shop. Then, a friend mentioned Franocity.com and the possibility of franchising a small business. Just a quick consultation, they said. Now I’m questioning everything! It’s a wild reminder that life rarely follows the script, and sometimes the best opportunities come from unexpected detours. Anyone else feel this?
