**The Great Mask Struggle (and My Beard’s Rebellion)**

Let’s be honest, 2024 feels like a year of adjustments, right? And for me, one of those adjustments has been surprisingly…personal. I’ve been battling sleep apnea, and the whole CPAP journey started with a frustrating realization: my beard was staging a full-blown rebellion against my new machine. 

Seriously, a nasal mask just *didn’t* work. Then came the full face mask – a valiant attempt, but it felt like wearing a clown nose. It was uncomfortable, itchy, and constantly shifting.  It’s funny, isn’t it? Something designed to *help* you sleep is actually adding to the problem. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best solutions aren’t the most obvious.  Finding the right CPAP gear felt like a mini-adventure, and a surprisingly intimate one, with my own face and my stubborn beard!  Anyone else have a similar struggle?
