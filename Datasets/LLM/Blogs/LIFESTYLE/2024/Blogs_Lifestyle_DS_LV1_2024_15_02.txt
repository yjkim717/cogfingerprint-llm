### The Digital Queue: A Lesson in Patience

It was supposed to be simple. As a loyal season ticket holder, I was poised to snag an away ticket the moment they went on sale. My laptop was open, my eticketing profile logged in. 10 AM hit, I clicked "purchase," and... the site crashed. A spinning wheel of doom.

My heart sank, but my bank account didn’t—the payment went through. Yet, my inbox remained stubbornly empty. No email confirmation, no order reference, just a pit in my stomach and a hefty dose of frustration.

In our hyper-efficient 2024 world, we expect instant gratification. That afternoon, stuck in digital limbo, was a stark reminder that technology is fallible. It forced me to pause, take a breath, and realize that sometimes, the things we want most require a little extra patience—and a few deep breaths—before they’re truly ours. The ticket, thankfully, did eventually appear. The lesson, however, was the real win.
