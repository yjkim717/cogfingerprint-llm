It’s 2024, and I’m sitting in a small café in Lisbon, watching our daughter sketch the tram lines outside. A year ago, this moment would have felt like a fantasy. We were stuck in the familiar grind—school runs, mortgage payments, the quiet hum of “someday” always in the background.

Then we discovered FIRE. Not just as a financial strategy, but as a key to a different kind of life. The goal wasn't just to retire early; it was to live now. To trade the static for the nomadic, the classroom for the world.

Homeschooling on the road isn't always easy. Some days, math happens on a beach in Mexico; history is a walk through ancient Roman ruins. It’s messy, unpredictable, and utterly real. We’re not just teaching our child about the world—we’re letting the world teach her.

Financial independence gave us the map, but courage made us take the first step. And here, sipping coffee thousands of miles from our old life, I’ve never felt more at home.
