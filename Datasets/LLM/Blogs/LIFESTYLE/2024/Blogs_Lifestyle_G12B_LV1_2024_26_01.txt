## Is it *Really* That Different? The Ticket Scalper Debate & My Closet

It’s wild how much heat ticket scalpers get, right? Everywhere you look, there’s outrage about inflated prices and missing out on seeing your favorite band. And I get it, it stings. But honestly, scrolling through Depop and StockX these days, it feels…familiar.

I mean, limited-edition sneakers resell for *way* more than retail. Vintage band tees? Forget about it. We’re all participating in a market of scarcity and desire, just in different forms. I even flipped a few old vinyl records last year!

Maybe the concert ticket thing hits harder because it feels tied to a shared *experience*, a collective joy being priced out. But the underlying principle – someone buying something with the intent to profit – is everywhere. It makes you wonder, where do we draw the line? And are we really as shocked as we think we are?



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
