**The Weight of a Deposit: Why Trust Feels Different Now**

Remember those early twenties days of Craigslist rentals? A quick glance, a hopeful DM, and suddenly you were picturing your new life. It felt…easy. But lately, something’s shifted. I was reading a Reddit thread the other day – a guy genuinely freaked out about verifying a potential roommate’s property ownership before handing over a deposit. It struck a chord. 

It’s not that I’m paranoid, exactly. It’s just that the internet has layered a new kind of anxiety onto these everyday decisions.  Back then, a handshake and a shared pizza felt like enough. Now, I find myself compulsively Googling, checking public records, obsessing over rental agreements. 

Maybe it’s just getting older. Maybe it’s the constant stream of online scams. Whatever it is, I’m realizing that building trust feels heavier now, and that's okay.  It just means I’m valuing security and peace of mind a little more.
