**Waterlogged Dreams: A Lesson in Prioritizing Peace**

Okay, so 2024 was supposed to be *the* summer. We’d booked it – Water Country USA, a massive water park, a guaranteed blast of sunshine and screaming kids. And honestly? It was… a lot. 

I’d envisioned blissful afternoons spent splashing in wave pools and conquering slides. Instead, it felt like a strategic battle against the crowds. Seriously, the queues were insane. We’re talking an hour-long wait for the lazy river – an hour! My little one, Leo, started to genuinely whine, and my husband, Mark, was visibly stressed. 

We’d splurged on fast passes, thinking it would be a game-changer, but even those felt like a frantic race to snag a spot before someone else did. It completely sucked the joy out of everything.  

Looking back, I realize we’d let the *idea* of a perfect day overshadow the reality. We were so focused on ticking off every ride, on maximizing our “fun,” that we completely missed the point. 

This trip wasn't about conquering a water park; it was about spending time together.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best memories aren't made in the most crowded, chaotic places.  Next year, I’m thinking a quiet beach day. Just us, the sun, and maybe a really good book.  Anyone else feel like a little less “doing” and a little more “being” is desperately needed?
