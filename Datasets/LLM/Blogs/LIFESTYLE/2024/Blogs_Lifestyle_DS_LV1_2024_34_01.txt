That voicemail from QTC about my C&P exam threw me—apparently, it didn’t go through. In 2024, we’re promised seamless tech, yet here I am, caught in a glitch. It’s a reminder that life’s flow isn’t always smooth, even with systems meant to support us. I’m learning to breathe through these hiccups, trusting that rescheduling is just a detour, not a dead end. Some days, resilience means picking up the phone and starting over.
