### The Friendship Gap: Are We Living in a Sitcom World?

I was binge-watching a classic sitcom the other night—the kind where the whole gang miraculously has every Tuesday night free for trivia at their local bar. As I watched them finish each other’s sentences and share life’s biggest moments in real-time, a familiar pang hit me. My phone was buzzing with a group chat I hadn’t checked in two days, filled with memes and “we should totally…” plans that we all know might never happen.

It’s 2024, and our social lives are a strange paradox. We’re more “connected” than ever, yet genuine, consistent connection feels harder to pin down. My calendar is a mosaic of work blocks, family obligations, and the relentless scroll of social media, where I “like” a friend’s vacation photos but haven’t actually heard about their trip.

Those TV friendships set a subconscious bar—a standard of effortless, always-available camaraderie. But our reality is different. Our friendships are now built in the margins. They’re the 10-minute voice notes exchanged during a commute, the quick coffee squeezed in before school pickup, and the supportive comments on a vulnerable Instagram story.

And maybe that’s okay. Maybe the magic isn’t in replicating a sitcom, but in appreciating the new form our bonds have taken. It’s not about having a permanent booth at a coffee shop, but about the profound understanding that even when life gets loud, the friendship remains, patiently waiting in the quiet spaces for its moment to truly connect. That’s a realism I can get behind.
