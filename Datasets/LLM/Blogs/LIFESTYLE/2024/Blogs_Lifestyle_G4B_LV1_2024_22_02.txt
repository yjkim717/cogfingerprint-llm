**A Little Shift, A Lot of Thinking**

Okay, so things have shifted a bit at Vanguard this year, and honestly, it’s made me pause. For ages, I’ve been happily snapping up tiny bits of VTI – fractional shares – to build my portfolio. It felt so accessible, so low-pressure. Now, they’ve reverted to needing whole dollar amounts. 

It’s a small thing, really, but it’s got me thinking about how much I *really* want to invest right now.  Is it about the specific stock, or just the feeling of being in control? Maybe it’s time to revisit my long-term goals and see if this change is a gentle nudge to slow down and be more intentional with my money.
