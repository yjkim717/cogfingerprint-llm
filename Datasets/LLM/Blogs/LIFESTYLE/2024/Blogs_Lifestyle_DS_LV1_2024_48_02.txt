My aunt’s offer felt like a gift: her fully-paid timeshare, free to me. But 2024 taught me to look past the price tag. I had to ask myself the hard questions: Could I handle the rising maintenance fees? Would it fit my flexible, remote-work lifestyle? In the end, I realized it wasn’t just about a free vacation—it was a commitment. I thanked her and passed, choosing freedom over a schedule. Sometimes the best things in life really are free of strings.
