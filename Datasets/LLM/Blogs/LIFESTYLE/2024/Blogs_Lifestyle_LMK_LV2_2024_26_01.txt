"The Unseen Value: Why Concert Ticket Scalpers Get a Bad Rap"

As I waited anxiously for my favorite artist's tour dates to go on sale in 2024, I couldn't help but wonder - why do we love vintage clothing resellers and detest concert ticket scalpers? Both resell items, often at a markup. So, what's the difference? Is it because we're nostalgic for the past, but feel ripped off when we pay above face value for a live experience? Perhaps our distaste stems from the perceived authenticity of the concert experience being tainted by profit-driven reselling.
