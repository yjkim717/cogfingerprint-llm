The unfair hate towards concert ticket scalpers. Why do we vilify them for reselling tickets at a markup, while praising those who flip vintage clothing or sneakers for a profit? It's all about perspective. In today's resale market, the lines are blurred. Fans are willing to pay top dollar to see their favorite artists live, and resellers are happy to oblige. Perhaps it's time to rethink our stance on ticket scalping and recognize it as just another facet of the live music experience. After all, a fan's enthusiasm shouldn't be judged.
