**Two Years Gone – And Still Finding My Way**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single sentence can hold so much weight. “Two years sober.” Saying it out loud still feels…surreal. It’s been two years since I stepped through the doors of my first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, two years since I tentatively opened *The Big Book* and started to actually *read* it. 

I’m not going to stand here and pretend it’s been a straight line to sunshine and rainbows. Recovery isn’t a destination; it’s a messy, beautiful, and incredibly challenging journey. There were days, honestly, where I just wanted to crawl back into the familiar comfort of a bottle. Days filled with shame, regret, and a deep-seated feeling of ‘why bother?’

But something kept pulling me back. It wasn’t willpower, not really. It was the quiet, persistent voice of something bigger than myself - a kind of spiritual guidance, as the AA literature describes it.  It wasn’t about religion, not in the traditional sense. It was about a yearning for connection, for honesty, for a life that felt…real.

*The Big Book* wasn’t a magic bullet, but it was a lifeline. Reading those stories of other men – men who had wrestled with the same demons I was facing – offered a validation I desperately needed.  It showed me I wasn’t alone, that this struggle was shared, and that there *was* a path forward. 

Now, two years in, I’m still learning. I still have bad days.  I still grapple with triggers and anxieties.  But I also have a community, a support system, and a newfound understanding of myself.  

This isn’t about perfection; it’s about progress. It’s about showing up, one day at a time, and leaning into the support offered.  It’s about embracing the vulnerability that comes with admitting you need help. 

If you’re struggling, please, *please* reach out. There's a meeting near you, and there's a whole world of people who understand.  And if you’re considering taking that first step, know that it’s the bravest thing you’ll ever do.

Would you like me to adjust this in any way – perhaps focusing on a specific element of the story, or aiming for a slightly different tone?
