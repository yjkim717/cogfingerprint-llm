**The Quiet Comfort of Wool**

There’s something so grounding about the simple act of knitting, isn’t there? This year, I’ve been completely obsessed with creating a pair of baby alpaca mitts – a little project inspired by a vintage pattern I found. It’s forcing me to slow down, to focus on the rhythm of the needles, and to really *feel* the yarn in my hands. 

I’m currently hunting down the perfect DK weight baby alpaca, and it’s surprisingly meditative!  It reminds me of cozy evenings, wrapped in a blanket, and the satisfaction of making something beautiful and warm with my own two hands.  What small, tactile joys are bringing you peace this year?
