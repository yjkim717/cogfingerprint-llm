There I was, putting the final touches on my vision board in Canva when—poof—hours of work vanished. My heart sank. In our always-online world, we trust technology to hold our dreams. That glitch felt like more than lost slides; it was my creative momentum, interrupted. It reminded me that while digital tools shape our lives, sometimes the most reliable canvas is still the one we build offline, moment by mindful moment.
