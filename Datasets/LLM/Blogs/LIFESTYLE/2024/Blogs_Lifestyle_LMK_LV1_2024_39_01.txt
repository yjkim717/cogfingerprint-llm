As I stand in front of my cluttered vanity, I'm reminded of the ever-changing world of beauty. In 2024, our routines are more conscious than ever. I've curated a selection of my favorite products - a bold lipstick for a night out, a reliable sunscreen for daily protection, and a nourishing hair care serum to combat dry ends. Some, like my signature perfume, are staples, while others, like that trendy eyeshadow palette, are marked for a potential trade with friends. It's a constant evolution, but one that brings me joy. What's in your beauty bag this season?
