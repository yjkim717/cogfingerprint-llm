## A Little Piece of Kyiv

It’s funny how objects hold stories. I recently unearthed a small, wooden hockey charm – a memento from the Ukrainian players our family hosted back in 2022. Finding it now, in 2024, brought a rush of memories. It's a tangible reminder of their resilience and our shared humanity, a simple gift carrying a world of meaning. I wonder if they still play.
