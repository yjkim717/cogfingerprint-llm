**The Weight of a Decision (and a Tent)**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How small decisions can suddenly feel monumentally important? Right now, I’m staring down the barrel of a pretty big one: choosing a tent for my upcoming thru-hike. Specifically, I’m wrestling with the Protrail and Preamble tarp tents. 

I’ve been diving deep into ultralight backpacking, obsessing over every gram.  The goal is a May start, and honestly, the thought of carrying extra weight is a serious deterrent.  I’ve been seriously considering a bug bivy as a minimalist option, but it just doesn’t feel…robust enough for the potential challenges. 

It’s more than just the tent itself, though. It’s about the feeling of being completely self-reliant, of stripping everything down to the essentials.  Choosing this shelter feels like a small step towards a bigger shift – a move towards a simpler, more intentional lifestyle.  Maybe it’s about prioritizing experiences over possessions, or just finding a way to be comfortable while still respecting the wild.  Wish me luck with the decision!
