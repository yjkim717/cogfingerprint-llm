**Two Years of Freedom: My Journey with Sobriety**

As I sit here, reflecting on the past two years, I am filled with a mix of emotions - gratitude, pride, and a hint of disbelief. It's hard to believe that it's been 24 months since I last had a drink. The journey to sobriety hasn't been easy, but it's been worth it. In this post, I'll share my story of how I found my way to a life free from the grip of alcohol, and the principles that have kept me on track.

My journey began with a realization that my drinking had spiralled out of control. I was attending social gatherings, and the thought of not having a drink was unbearable. I felt like I was missing out, and that a drink was necessary to unwind. But deep down, I knew that wasn't true. The guilt and shame that followed a night out were starting to take a toll on my mental health.

That's when I stumbled upon the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. I'd heard of AA, but never thought I'd be the type to attend meetings. However, the stories in the Big Book resonated with me. I saw myself in the struggles and triumphs of others who had walked the same path. The principles outlined in the book - honesty, surrender, and service - struck a chord. I knew I had to give it a try.

The first few months were tough. I attended meetings, worked through the 12 steps, and connected with others who were on the same journey. It wasn't easy to confront my demons, but with the support of my fellow travellers, I slowly began to heal. The Big Book became my guide, offering wisdom and comfort whenever I needed it.

Two years on, I can confidently say that sobriety has been a game-changer. I've discovered a new sense of purpose and meaning. I've formed deeper connections with others, and I've learned to manage my emotions in a healthier way. Of course, there are still challenges, but I'm equipped with the tools to face them head-on.

If you're struggling with your own sobriety journey, I want you to know that you're not alone. The principles outlined in the Big Book have been a lifeline for me, and I'm confident they can be for you too. It's not about being perfect; it's about being willing to take that first step, and then the next, and the next.

As I look back on the past two years, I'm filled with gratitude for this journey. It's not always been easy, but it's been worth it. If you're considering taking the leap, I encourage you to do so. You never know where it might lead you.
