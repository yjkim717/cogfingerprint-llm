>## Curating My Digital Peace of Mind

It's 2024, and the sheer volume of information hitting us daily is…a lot. Lately, I've been hyper-aware of how certain corners of the internet, even on platforms I enjoy like Reddit, can suck away precious mental energy. I realized I wasn't actively choosing what I consumed; I was just reacting. 

So, I started filtering. On my Reddit app, I’ve been ruthlessly blocking specific subreddits from my main feed. It’s surprisingly liberating! It’s not about censorship, but about intentionally shaping my digital landscape to foster calm and focus. It’s a small change, but it's making a big difference in my overall well-being.
