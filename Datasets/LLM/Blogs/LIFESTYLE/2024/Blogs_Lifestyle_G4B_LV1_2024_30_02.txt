**The Drone Dilemma & That Little Voice of Doubt**

It’s weird, right? We’re living in 2024, where you can practically launch a drone from your backyard, but navigating airspace feels…complicated. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over this whole LAANC thing and flying near the local airport. I’m a licensed Part 107 pilot, but I got this itch to experiment with some recreational drone shots – close-ups of the landscape, you know? 

The question popped into my head: Do I *really* need LAANC authorization for these short, low-altitude flights? It’s a tiny worry, a little voice of doubt whispering about the FAA and Part 107. It’s a good reminder that even with the tech, responsibility and understanding the rules are key to enjoying this incredible hobby safely.  Anyone else wrestling with this?
