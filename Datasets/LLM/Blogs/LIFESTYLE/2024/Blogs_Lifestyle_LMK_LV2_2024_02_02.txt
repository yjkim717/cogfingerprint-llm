As I sipped my morning coffee in 2024, I couldn't help but think about how my daily routine has become a jigsaw puzzle of work and life. With the rise of SaaS integration, it's become easier to access various tools and apps, but it's also blurred the lines between work and personal time. I've found myself checking work emails during dinner or scrolling through dashboards during family time. It's as if I'm constantly "on". 

I've come to realize that it's not just about switching tools, like moving from PowerBI to Yellowfin, but about setting boundaries. It's about being intentional with my time and energy. By doing so, I've started to reclaim my evenings and weekends. I've begun to see the beauty in the mundane and appreciate the little things. It's a journey, not a destination. As I navigate this new normal, I'm learning to prioritize what truly matters â€“ my loved ones, my well-being, and my own personal growth.
