### The Aloe Vera and Me: A Lesson in Resilience

It’s funny how a plant can hold up a mirror to your own life. This year, my poor aloe vera became a bit of a project. After a clumsy fall (my fault), a hopeful repotting, and then a harsh case of sunburn from my "bright idea" to give it more light, it was looking pretty defeated—leaning over its pot like it had given up.

I realized I’d been either drowning it on a frantic schedule or forgetting it entirely. The pot, I finally admitted, had terrible drainage. Sound familiar? In 2024, we’re all so busy optimizing our lives that we forget the basics: a solid foundation and consistent, gentle care.

Repotting it into something with proper drainage felt symbolic. It wasn’t an instant fix, but a commitment to paying better attention. Just like my aloe, we all need the right environment to stand tall again. It’s a slow, patient journey back to upright.
