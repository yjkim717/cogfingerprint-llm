It’s 2024, and I’m still getting used to this feeling. For years, being a Bills fan meant bracing for heartbreak. Now, watching Detroit’s rise, I get it. That shift—from expecting the worst to genuinely believing you’ll win—is surreal. It’s not just about football; it’s a life lesson. When you’ve weathered so many storms, a little sunshine feels revolutionary. Here’s to hoping both our teams keep defying the odds. It’s a beautiful thing to finally expect joy.
