As I tune into the eerie world of 'The First', I'm reminded of H.G. Wells' timeless classic, 'War of the Worlds'. The thrill of first contact and encounters with paranormal entities draws me in. I'm on the hunt for more audio dramas like it, exploring the unknown and redefining our understanding of the universe, much like SETI's ongoing quest.
