### The Day I Stopped Blaming the Rain: A Lesson in Personal Power

I remember the morning it all clicked for me. It was a grey, drizzly Tuesday in March 2024. I was running late, my coffee had spilled in my travel mug, and a notification on my phone informed me that a project I’d been counting on had just been postponed. Again.

My internal monologue was a well-rehearsed symphony of frustration. *This always happens to me. The universe is against me. If only my boss had communicated better, if only the weather was nicer, if only…*

Sound familiar?

I was about to text my friend my usual litany of complaints when I paused, my thumb hovering over the screen. A question popped into my head, one so simple it was almost revolutionary: **What if this isn't happening *to* me, but *for* me?**

That question was the first crack in the dam of my victim mentality. For years, I’d operated under the assumption that life was something that happened, and I was just along for the ride, reacting to whatever came my way. Good things were luck; bad things were fate. I had given away my power without even realizing I had it.

Taking 100% responsibility isn’t about blaming yourself for every flat tire or cancelled plan. It’s not about guilt. It’s about a profound mindset shift. It’s the recognition that while I can’t control the rain, I *can* control my response to it. I can choose to see a cancelled project not as a setback, but as found time. I can choose to see a spilled coffee as a minor inconvenience, not a portent of a terrible day.

This is the core of a growth mindset. It’s moving from “Why is this happening to me?” to “What is this trying to teach me?”

That drizzly Tuesday, I made a choice. I put my phone down. I took a deep breath, wiped out my mug, and made a new coffee. I used the extra time from my postponed project to finally organize my chaotic digital files—a task I’d been avoiding for months. I even put on my favourite playlist and decided to enjoy the sound of the rain against the window.

The circumstances hadn’t changed, but my reality had. By shifting my focus from what I couldn’t control to what I could—my actions, my attitude, my interpretation—I transformed a frustrating morning into a productive and oddly peaceful one.

This is personal power. It’s the quiet understanding that you are the author of your story, not just a character being pushed around by the plot. It’s in the daily, intentional choices: choosing curiosity over criticism, action over apathy, and reflection over resentment.

The rain didn’t stop that day. But my complaining did. And that has made all the difference.
