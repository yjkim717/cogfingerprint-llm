As I sipped my morning coffee in 2024, I pondered the complexities of modern theft laws. Can someone who orders laptops with a stolen credit card be charged with theft of the laptops? It's a grey area. While they didn't physically steal the laptops, their actions led to financial loss. Package theft and identity theft are serious crimes, and the law should reflect that. Perhaps it's time to reevaluate our legal charges to keep pace with the digital age.
