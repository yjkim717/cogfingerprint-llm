It’s funny how the smallest things can throw your whole day off balance. This morning, I logged into my Vanguard account, coffee in hand, ready to drop a few dollars into VTI—just my usual routine. But the fractional shares option? Gone. Vanished.

For a moment, panic flickered. My carefully planned, bite-sized investing habit, disrupted. It felt like a tiny crack in the foundation of the future I’m building, one fractional share at a time.

Then, on a whim, I refreshed the page. There it was—back like it never left. I laughed at myself. In 2024, we’re so wired for instant, seamless control that a minor tech hiccup feels like a personal affront. It was a gentle reminder: not everything needs a dramatic reaction. Sometimes, you just need to pause, refresh, and keep moving forward.
