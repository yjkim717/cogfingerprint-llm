## The Little Ritual That Saved My Prints (and Maybe My Sanity)

Okay, confession time. I’m a 3D printing addict. It's a wonderfully nerdy hobby, but like any passion, it can throw curveballs. Lately, I was battling a frustrating problem: my first layer adhesion was *terrible*. I'd spend ages leveling the bed, tweaking settings, and still end up with warped corners and a general sense of defeat. 

It turns out, the culprit was lurking right under my nose – literally. Filament residue was building up on the nozzle, subtly throwing off the initial layer’s contact with the bed. It was a tiny thing, but it was making a huge difference.

So, I started experimenting. I wanted a way to *automatically* clean that nozzle and reset my position before each calibration. After some tinkering with the G-code (hello, `G28Z`!), I finally cracked it. Now, my printer automatically homes and then moves the nozzle to a designated cleaning spot before recalibrating. 

It’s a small change, a little ritual really, but it’s made a world of difference. My prints are sticking like champions, and honestly, I feel a lot less stressed. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest improvements come from tackling the smallest, most annoying details. And in the world of 3D printing, and maybe even life, that's a lesson worth remembering in 2024.
