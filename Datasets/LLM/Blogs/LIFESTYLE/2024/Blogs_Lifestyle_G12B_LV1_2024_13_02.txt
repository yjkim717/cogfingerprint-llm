>## The Unexpected Upgrade: My Quest for a Better VR Experience (and a Little Peace of Mind)

Okay, so I'll admit it. I’m officially one of *those* people. The person who spends a suspiciously large amount of time lost in virtual worlds. My Oculus Quest has become a serious hobby, a way to de-stress after a long day, explore new environments, and even sneak in a workout or two. 

But recently, my VR bliss was being constantly interrupted by… lag. Seriously frustrating lag. It turns out my ancient router was struggling to keep up with the demands of streaming high-resolution VR over Wi-Fi. 

So, I dove down a rabbit hole. Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E, Air Link…it was a whole new language! After a bit of research (and a surprisingly fun deep dive into tech reviews), I finally upgraded to a budget-friendly router with Wi-Fi 6E. 

The difference is night and day. Smoother gameplay, fewer disconnects, and a whole lot less frustration. It’s a small upgrade, sure, but it's breathed new life into my VR hobby and, honestly, improved my overall internet experience around the house. Who knew a router could bring so much peace of mind?
