"As a family of four, we're no strangers to the RV lifestyle. In 2024, we're upgrading to a 5th wheel with a separate bunk room for the kids. It's been a game-changer! The pros: more space, less chaos, and actual bedrooms for the little ones. Cons: bigger rig means more to manage. Still, we're loving the extra room to breathe - and the kids adore their cozy bunk haven."
