>## The Dirt & The Dress Code: Finding My Style in the Landscaping World (and Loving Myself in It)

Okay, let’s be real. Being a sales director is demanding enough, but try being one in the landscaping industry. You need to project competence, build trust, and, you know, *look* like you could probably wield a shovel if needed. It’s a tricky balance. 

I've been wrestling with it lately. How do you convey professionalism and style when you know you'll be hopping out of the car to walk a property, potentially getting a little muddy? And let's not even get started on the body image piece – finding clothes that actually *fit* and flatter when you’re not a size zero feels like a constant battle.

This year, I’m determined to ditch the self-doubt and embrace a workwear style that feels authentically *me*. Think durable fabrics, tailored fits, and a pop of personality (maybe a great scarf or a bold pair of boots!). It’s about finding pieces that make me feel confident and capable, whether I’m presenting a proposal or inspecting a flower bed. 

Anyone else navigating a unique work dress code and struggling with feeling good in their own skin? I’d love to hear your tips! Let’s build each other up!
