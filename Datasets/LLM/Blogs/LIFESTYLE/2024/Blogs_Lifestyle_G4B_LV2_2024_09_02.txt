**The Day the House Shook**

It was a strange Tuesday. Just a little *rumble* – a brief earth tremor, really – that vibrated through my furniture and made me pause. It felt… subterranean, like something was moving beneath our feet. Suddenly, I thought about my neighbours, wondering if they felt it too. It’s funny how these little moments make you consider the unseen world, the quiet shifts happening just below the surface of our everyday lives.  Makes you appreciate a solid floor, doesn’t it?
