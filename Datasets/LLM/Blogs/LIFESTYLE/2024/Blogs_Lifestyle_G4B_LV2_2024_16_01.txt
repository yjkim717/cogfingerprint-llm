**The Shiny Degree and the Quiet Doubt**

Okay, let's be real. 2024 feels like everyone’s chasing a shiny thing – a perfect job, a perfect career path, a perfect… everything. I was recently talking to a friend, fresh out of computer engineering, and he was wrestling with something a lot of us are probably feeling: a quiet, persistent doubt about his degree. 

He landed a decent job, sure – web development, which is hot right now. But there’s this nagging feeling, isn’t there? A little voice whispering, “Is this *really* what I wanted? Is this degree *really* going to set me up for life?” 

It’s a surprisingly common feeling, especially with how saturated the job market is in tech. You spend years studying, pouring over code, and then suddenly, you’re competing with hundreds of other graduates for the same roles. 

I think it’s okay to feel that uncertainty. It doesn't mean you made the wrong choice. It just means you’re human. Maybe it’s time to shift the focus from chasing a *perfect* career to building a *good* one – one that aligns with your evolving interests and values.  What steps are *you* taking to navigate those feelings of career doubt?
