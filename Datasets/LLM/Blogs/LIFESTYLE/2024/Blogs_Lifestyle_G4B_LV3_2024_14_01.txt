**The Weight of Quiet: When ‘Healthy’ Doesn’t Feel Like Enough**

It’s 2024, and I’m supposed to be thriving. I eat well, I exercise, I even meditate (sometimes!). Yet, lately, I’ve been battling a frustrating fog – a persistent brain fog coupled with a bone-deep exhaustion that just… sits. It’s baffling because, logically, I *should* be feeling energized.
