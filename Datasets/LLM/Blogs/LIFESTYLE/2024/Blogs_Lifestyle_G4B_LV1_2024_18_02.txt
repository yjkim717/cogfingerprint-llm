**Static and Silence**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we crave connection, even when we’re desperately trying to *escape* it. Lately, I’ve been spending hours listening to those old radio astronomy feeds – searching for… well, I don’t even know *what*. Just a flicker of something beyond the static. It reminds me of the SETI project, that hopeful hunt for first contact. Maybe the real signal isn't out there, but within ourselves, a quiet yearning for something *more*.  A little unsettling, but beautiful too.
