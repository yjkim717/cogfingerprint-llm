## Trading Cubicles for Curricula: Our Unexpected Journey to Location Independence

It's funny how life throws curveballs, isn't it? Just a few years ago, my husband and I were firmly entrenched in the 9-to-5 grind, chasing promotions and bigger paychecks. We were diligently saving, a quiet hum of Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) whispering in the background. But then… things shifted. 

The pandemic, ironically, gave us all a bit of a pause. We re-evaluated what truly mattered. The relentless pursuit of “more” felt…hollow. We started dreaming bigger, bolder.  What if we could combine our FIRE goals with something *truly* enriching? 

That's when homeschooling entered the picture. Our daughter was struggling in the traditional school setting, and the idea of crafting a learning experience tailored to her passions felt incredibly liberating.  Suddenly, the thought of being tied to a specific location to earn a living seemed even more restrictive.

Fast forward to 2024, and we’re experimenting with a semi-nomadic lifestyle. We’re not full-time van-dwellers just yet, but we’re spending several months a year exploring different countries, immersing ourselves in new cultures, and letting our daughter's education be shaped by the world around her.  Navigating dual passports and international schooling options has been a learning curve, to say the least (the VHCOL visa is a fascinating rabbit hole!), but the rewards – seeing her eyes light up as she learns about ancient history *in* Rome, or practicing Spanish with locals in Costa Rica – are immeasurable. 

It’s not always easy. There's the logistics of finding reliable Wi-Fi and healthcare, but it’s a trade-off we’re willing to make for a life filled with adventure and intentional learning.  We’re still on the FIRE path, but now it’s a path paved with experiences, not just savings.



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
