## My Secret Weapon for Video Editing (and Less Frustration!)

Okay, so I'll admit, I was feeling the pinch. Editing 4K video on my older system was… a struggle. Constant loading, lag, the whole frustrating shebang. Then I stumbled upon something intriguing: using a speedy NVMe SSD to *cache* my slower SATA SSD. 

It sounds techy, I know! But essentially, it’s like giving my system a turbo boost for frequently accessed files. I'm using Intel RapidStorage for this, and honestly, the difference is night and day. Small files zip open, and those massive video projects feel… manageable. It's a surprisingly simple tweak that's seriously improved my workflow (and my sanity!) in 2024. Anyone else experimenting with creative storage solutions?
