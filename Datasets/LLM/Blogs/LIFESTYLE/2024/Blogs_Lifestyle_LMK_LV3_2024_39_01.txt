As I reflect on my beauty staples in 2024, I'm reminded that self-care is about more than just products â€“ it's a lifestyle. My daily routine is anchored by a few trusted skincare essentials, a swipe of favorite makeup, and a nourishing haircare treatment. These simple pleasures cultivate a sense of calm and confidence. By prioritizing the products and practices that make me feel my best, I'm embracing a more intentional, self-loving lifestyle that shines through in every aspect of my life.
