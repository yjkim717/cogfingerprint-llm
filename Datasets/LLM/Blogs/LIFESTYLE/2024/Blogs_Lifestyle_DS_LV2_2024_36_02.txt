It’s 2024, and my brain still can’t keep up with my life. Between work deadlines, my kid’s recitals, and that dentist appointment I keep forgetting, my Galaxy S20 is my lifeline. I was manually typing everything into my calendar, a tedious dance of typos and frustration. Then I discovered apps that let me just scan a flyer or speak into my phone. It feels like magic. That small tech upgrade didn’t just organize my schedule; it gave me back a little piece of my sanity.
