### The Degree and the Disconnect

I remember sitting in my university library in 2022, surrounded by towers of textbooks on machine learning and processor architecture. I felt like a wizard-in-training, on the cusp of building the future. My computer engineering degree was my golden ticket.

Fast forward to 2024, and my inbox is a graveyard of job applications. The roles? Endless variations of "build a slightly better e-commerce button." Don't get me wrong, web development is crucial, but it’s a far cry from the complex systems I spent years studying.

There’s a quiet disillusionment that sets in when you realize the "real world" might not need your specific brand of magic. I poured my soul into understanding the poetry of algorithms, only to be asked to mostly just rhyme. It feels like training for a marathon and being handed a participation ribbon for a brisk walk.

But here’s what I’m slowly learning: the degree wasn’t just about the first job description. It taught me a rigorous way to solve problems, a skill that transcends any single programming language. Maybe the path isn't a straight line from lecture hall to dream job. Maybe it's about finding where my deep knowledge can add unexpected value, even in a world obsessed with the next click. The journey is just messier, and far more human, than I ever expected.
