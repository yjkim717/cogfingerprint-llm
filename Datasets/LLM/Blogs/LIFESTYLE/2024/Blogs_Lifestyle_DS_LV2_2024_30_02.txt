The golden hour light was just starting to soften over the coastal cliffs, and my drone hovered perfectly—capturing the exact shot I’d envisioned for months. But a year ago, that moment wouldn’t have happened.

Back then, I was tangled in confusion over FAA rules. As a recreational flyer, I wondered: could I even use LAANC for quick, spontaneous flights without a Part 107 license? I spent evenings scrolling forums, half-convinced I’d need another costly certificate. It felt like bureaucracy was gatekeeping creativity.

Then I found the clarity I needed—yes, recreational pilots with the TRUST certificate can access LAANC in controlled airspace. That simple “yes” changed everything. No longer burdened by doubt, I started chasing sunsets and shoreline waves with confidence.

It’s funny how a little permission—both from the FAA and yourself—can open up the sky. Now, my travel memories aren’t just snapshots; they’re small victories, framed by the freedom to fly.
