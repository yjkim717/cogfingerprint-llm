There’s something special about knitting for someone you love—the careful choice of yarn, the rhythm of the needles. This year, I set my heart on crafting the coziest mitts from a soft, dark gray, DK weight baby alpaca. But my search hit a snag; favorites like Plymouth and King Cole just weren’t available in the right shade. It’s funny how a simple project can remind you that sometimes, the perfect match requires patience and a little more digging. The journey, though, is part of the gift.
