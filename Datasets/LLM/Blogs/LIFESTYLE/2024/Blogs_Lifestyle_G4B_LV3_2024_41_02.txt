It’s weird, isn’t it? As a Bills fan, watching the Detroit Lions dominate this season has been… surprisingly uplifting.  I’ve spent years bracing for disappointment, expecting another heartbreak. But seeing them actually *win*, genuinely *soar* – it’s a feeling of hopeful disbelief.  It’s like finally expecting a good outcome, a shift in the usual Detroit weather.  I’m curious to see how long this momentum lasts, and honestly, a little envious of the joy they’re bringing to the city.  Maybe this year will be different.
