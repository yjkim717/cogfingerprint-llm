There’s a quiet hum in the air these days—one that’s different from the relentless buzz of pre-pandemic London. I’ve noticed it here in my new hometown, a place with a market square and neighbours who know your name. After years of chasing city life, something shifted. Maybe it was the lockdowns that made us crave green spaces and real connection, or maybe we just grew tired of the rush.

Now, I see other former Londoners around, drawn not to remote isolation but to these lively, medium-sized towns. There’s a sense of regeneration here—a sweet spot between opportunity and community. We haven’t abandoned ambition; we’ve just replanted it somewhere we can also breathe, somewhere with room to grow. It feels less like running away and more like coming home. The future, it turns out, might just be found in the gentle rhythm of a local high street and the promise of a life that feels whole.
