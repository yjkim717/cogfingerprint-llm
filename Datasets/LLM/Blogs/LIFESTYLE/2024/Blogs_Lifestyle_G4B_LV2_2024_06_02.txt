**Navigating the Ptown Puzzle**

This summer, the thought of a week-long rental in Provincetown sparked a little anxiety. Not about the gorgeous beaches or the charming town, but the parking! Seriously, trying to figure out where to stash the car for a whole week felt… overwhelming, especially with my folks in tow. 

It led me down a rabbit hole of town parking rules and even researching the Grace Hall lot.  It’s funny how a simple logistical question can highlight the need for a little planning and peace of mind.  Anyone else feel this pre-trip scramble?
