As I hit the trails on my trusty bike in 2024, I realized that my beloved 27.5 tubeless tires were on the verge of a crisis. Schwalbe's discontinuation of their Marathon tires for 27.5 tubeless wheels left me scrambling for alternatives. I'm not alone in my quest - many fellow riders are searching for reliable options. I'm exploring latex tubes as a potential solution, but I'm curious about other 650b tire options. The great tire drought has me rethinking my riding lifestyle and seeking out new adventures - and tires that can keep up.
