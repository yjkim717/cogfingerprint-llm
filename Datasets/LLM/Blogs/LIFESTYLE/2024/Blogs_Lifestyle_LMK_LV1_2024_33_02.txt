As I sat editing my latest video in Adobe Premiere in 2024, I hit a snag - scaling text in the Captions and Graphics section was proving to be a challenge. It made me reflect on how our digital struggles can mirror life's frustrations. Just as I needed to adjust my text to fit the frame, we must adapt to life's unexpected changes. Sometimes, it's about finding the right tool or perspective to make everything align perfectly.
