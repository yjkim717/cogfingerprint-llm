## The Take-Home Test That Left Me Questioning Everything

Okay, so it happened. I poured hours into that take-home assignment for a role I *really* wanted – an MBA skillset felt perfectly suited, right? Got the rejection email last week. Brutal. And honestly, it’s got me doing a lot of thinking, not just about the job, but about how we approach problem-solving in general.

I leaned into a qualitative analysis, really digging into the ‘why’ behind the challenge. Turns out, they were looking for someone heavy on the quantitative side. It’s 2024, and while I value the human element, I'm realizing the business world still often prioritizes data above all else. It stings, sure, but maybe it’s a nudge to broaden my own toolkit. Anyone else ever felt like their strengths just didn’t quite *click*?
