There’s a little aloe plant on my windowsill that’s been teaching me about resilience lately. Earlier this year, it took a tumble, and I thought a fresh start—repotting it with care—would fix everything. But life had other plans. I moved it closer to the light, only to realize too late that the afternoon sun was harsh, leaving its leaves sunburned and tender.

Between work deadlines and life’s chaos, my watering habits became inconsistent, and my aloe began to droop, unable to stand on its own. Now, it leans against a small stake for support, a quiet reminder that growth isn’t always about standing tall alone. Sometimes, it’s about accepting help, finding balance, and trusting that with patience—and the right kind of care—we can heal, even after a fall.
