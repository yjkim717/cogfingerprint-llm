"As I reflect on my 2024 gaming habits, I realize I've been craving games that offer more than just a static character design. I'm drawn to titles where characters undergo a transformation - be it physical or mental - as they level up. It's a phenomenon that mirrors real-life self-improvement. Just as we evolve with new experiences, I want my in-game avatars to change too, reflecting their growth and newfound abilities."
