As we sit here in 2024, my partner and I are contemplating a drastic lifestyle change: ditching our 9-to-5s to homeschool our kid and hit the road. The FIRE movement has been a huge influence on our decision, and we're eager to join the ranks of families who've chosen this unconventional path. We're drawn to the VHCOL (Very High Cost of Living) crowd's stories of embracing simplicity and freedom. But we're also curious about the FatFIRE community - those who've achieved financial independence without sacrificing their love for travel and exploration. We're seeking advice from fellow travelers (literally and figuratively!) on how to make this transition smoothly. What are the essentials to pack (and unpack)? How do we maintain a sense of structure while still allowing for spontaneity? We're excited to trade in our daily commutes for a life of adventure and curiosity - and we're not alone. Joining this movement feels like the start of an incredible journey.
