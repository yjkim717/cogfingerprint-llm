As I stepped onto the lush green course in 2024, I was grateful for my trusty Pure app. This no-profit gem, created by a fellow golfer, has been a game-changer for our community. With just a tap, I can check the aeration status of my favorite courses, avoiding those dreaded uneven lies. It's amazing how a simple app can elevate my golfing experience and connect me with like-minded enthusiasts.
