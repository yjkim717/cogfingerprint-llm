### The Bearded Battle for Better Sleep

It’s 2024, and my quest for a good night’s sleep continues. My trusty CPAP machine has been a game-changer for my sleep apnea, but my beard and I have been at odds with my nasal mask for months. I’d wake up with a Sahara-dry mouth, having turned into a champion mouth-breather by 3 AM.

The classic advice was to shave or try a chin strap, but my beard isn’t just facial hair—it’s part of my identity. So, I took the plunge and ordered a full face mask, hoping it would seal over my beard.

The first night was a revelation. No more dry mouth! The seal wasn’t perfect, but it was effective. It felt like a truce had been declared. I’m learning that managing sleep apnea isn’t about finding one perfect solution, but about adapting. My journey is a reminder that our health tools should work for us, not the other way around—beard and all.
