The email from Hamilton College arrived on a Tuesday, and with it, a flutter of possibility. A job offer. A new beginning in Clinton, NY. My mind immediately raced past the career move to the life move. Could this be the place for our family to truly put down roots?

The big questions started swirling. Are the schools as nurturing as they seem online? I picture our kids trading screen time for exploring the lush, green trails Iâ€™ve read about. But then, I remember the warnings about the winters. Are we prepared for those long, cozy months indoors, relying on hot chocolate and board games? The biggest draw, though, is being just a short drive from family. The thought of spontaneous Sunday dinners and grandparents at soccer games makes my heart feel full. This isn't just a new job; it feels like a chance to build the connected, intentional life we've been dreaming of.
