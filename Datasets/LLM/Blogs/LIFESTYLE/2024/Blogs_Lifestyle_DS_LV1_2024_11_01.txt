The server hummed in the corner, a sleek new Proxmox build that was supposed to be my 10-gigabit powerhouse. I’d sourced what I thought were solid components, including a pair of Intel X520-DA2 cards. But the two SFP+ ports on each card stared back at me like dark, unblinking eyes. No link lights. No connection.

My first instinct was the classic IT blame game: were the DAC cables or the Finisar SFP+ modules the culprits? A quick swap with known-good parts from another machine yielded the same frustrating silence. The plot thickened.

Firing up a terminal, I turned to the trusty `ethtool`. The command `ethtool eth2` confirmed my fears—the driver was loaded, but the interface showed "Link detected: no." It was a classic case of enterprise-grade hardware being picky. After some frantic searching, I found forum posts suggesting the `ixgbe` driver could be finicky with certain third-party transceivers. A kernel parameter later to force the detection, and like magic, a green light finally glowed. The relief was palpable. It wasn't a hardware fault, just a stubborn software handshake. Another lesson learned in the world of DIY server builds.
