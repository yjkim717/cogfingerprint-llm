As I sit here in 2024, sipping my morning coffee, I'm faced with a daunting decision: should I sell my condo? The rising maintenance fees are eating away at my retirement savings, and the thought of potential capital gains tax is keeping me up at night. I've been considering investing in the stock market or putting my money into a low-cost index fund instead. It's tempting to cash out and diversify my portfolio, but I'm also attached to the idea of owning my first home. I remember the excitement of buying it as a first-time homebuyer, and the sense of accomplishment that came with it. As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that sometimes, it's not just about the financials - it's about the memories and experiences tied to a place. I'll need to crunch some numbers, but ultimately, I'll have to decide what's more valuable to me: the potential financial gain or the sentimental value.
