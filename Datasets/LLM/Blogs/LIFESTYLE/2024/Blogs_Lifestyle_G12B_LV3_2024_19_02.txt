## The Little Choices That Make a Big Difference (Like My Bathroom Floor!)

Okay, so I’m tackling a little bathroom reno this year – nothing huge, just a refresh. And I’ve hit a surprisingly tricky decision: LVP flooring! These planks are long enough that you *could* just lay them straight, right? Super easy. But something inside me just isn't letting it go. I’m really leaning towards staggering the seams for a more visually appealing look. 

It’s a small thing, I know. But isn't that what life’s about? Those little extra efforts, those details that elevate the everyday? It'll take a bit more time, but I think the finished result will be worth it. Wish me luck with the DIY!
