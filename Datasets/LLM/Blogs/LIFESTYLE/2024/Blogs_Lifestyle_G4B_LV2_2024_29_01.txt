**Echoes in the Present: Why ‘Homegoing’ Still Resonates**

It’s funny how a book can stick with you, doesn’t it? I recently finished ‘Homegoing’ by Yaa Gyasi, and honestly, it’s been swirling around in my thoughts ever since. The story, jumping between descendants of two half-sisters separated by slavery, is a powerful exploration of family legacy and the enduring scars of racism. 

What really struck me was how acutely it highlighted the ripple effect – how past traumas shape the present, even when we don't consciously recognize it. It made me think about my own family history, the unspoken stories and the quiet ways our ancestors’ experiences continue to influence our lives in 2024. 

It’s a challenging read, absolutely, but profoundly rewarding. Have you discovered a book lately that’s really made you reflect?
