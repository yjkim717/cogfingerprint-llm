### The Weight We Carry

It’s funny how a piece of gear can teach you a lesson about life. Last year, as I prepared for my Appalachian Trail thru-hike, my world revolved around grams. I was obsessed with finding the perfect ultralight shelter, finally settling on a sleek tarp-tent that clocked in under 25 ounces. The goal was simple: carry less, move easier.

And it worked. My pack was a feather compared to others. But I quickly learned that "light" doesn't always mean "easy." On cold, humid nights in the Smokies, I’d wake up to a world of my own making—a fine mist of condensation beading on the silnylon ceiling. I was so focused on the number on the scale that I hadn't fully respected the art of condensation management. I was dry from the rain, but damp from my own breath.

It was a veteran hiker at a shelter who offered the perfect, simple solution: a waterproof bivy sack to go inside. It added a few precious ounces, but it promised a guaranteed dry sleep. I hesitated, my ultralight ego bruised. But I bought it.

That small addition transformed my hike. It wasn’t just about being dry; it was about the peace of mind. I was no longer anxious about the weather inside my own shelter. I had been so focused on minimizing the weight in my pack that I forgot to minimize the weight on my mind. Sometimes, the lightest thing you can carry isn't a piece of gear you leave behind, but a worry you finally let go of.
