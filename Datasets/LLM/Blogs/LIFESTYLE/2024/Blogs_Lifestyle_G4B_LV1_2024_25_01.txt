**Leveling Up My Life, One Small Shift at a Time**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Thinking about “character development” feels weirdly… personal these days. Like Wilhelm in Borderlands 2, slowly revealing layers with each upgrade – a bit more confident, a touch more wry. Lately, I've been trying to apply that same principle to my own life. Small shifts: a new hobby, a braver conversation. It’s not about a dramatic transformation, but a gradual, satisfying evolution.  2024 feels like a good year for unlocking *my* attributes.
