>## My Aloe & My Life: A Reflection on Resilience

It’s funny how a little houseplant can mirror your life back at you, isn’t it? I've been staring at my aloe plant lately, and it's been a surprisingly poignant experience. A few months ago, it took a tumble – a dramatic fall from the windowsill, leaving it a little worse for wear. Then, I foolishly decided to move it to a new, sunnier spot, thinking I was doing it a favour. Sunburn, anyone?

The poor thing clearly wasn't happy. Its leaves started to droop, looking distinctly unhappy. I realized I’d been overwatering too, neglecting the fact that aloe is known for its impressive water retention. A bit of research (and a frantic Google search) revealed the problem – a shallow root system, struggling to anchor itself after the fall and adapt to the new environment.

It’s a metaphor, isn’t it? Life throws us falls, relocations, unexpected bursts of too much sun. We try to force things, thinking we know best, and end up overwatering our own struggles. This aloe is reminding me to be patient, to nurture the roots, to let things settle before pushing for growth. Repotting, both literally and figuratively, takes time and gentle care. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just *water less*.



Hope this resonates!
