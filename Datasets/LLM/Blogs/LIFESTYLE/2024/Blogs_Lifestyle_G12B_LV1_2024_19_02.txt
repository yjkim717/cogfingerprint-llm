>## The Unexpected Beauty of Imperfection (and My Bathroom Floor)

Okay, so I'm a planner. Always have been. Everything needs a system, a perfect layout. That's why, when tackling my tiny bathroom reno this year, I almost skipped staggering the LVP flooring. The boards are long enough to run straight, eliminating the need. But something felt...sterile.

A quick Reddit deep-dive (because that’s how we solve problems in 2024!) showed me the visual warmth staggering adds. It’s a small detail, a touch of intentional imperfection. And honestly? It makes the whole space feel cozier, more *lived-in*. Sometimes, letting go of rigid perfection is the best design choice of all.
