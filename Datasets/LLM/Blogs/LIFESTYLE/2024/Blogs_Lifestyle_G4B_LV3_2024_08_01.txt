**Jet Lag & Belfast Blues**

There’s something profoundly unsettling about that first arrival – the disorientation, the sheer *weariness* after a transatlantic flight. I just experienced it in Belfast, and honestly, the thought of navigating a new city felt overwhelming. My priority? Getting to my friend’s place, but with a serious caveat: my phone’s data plan was about to hit its limit. 

It made me realize how reliant we’ve become on instant connection.  Maybe the best travel experience isn’t about mapping every route and staying constantly online, but about embracing a little bit of being lost, and truly present in the moment.  Sometimes, a slower pace – and a good conversation – is the most efficient journey of all.
