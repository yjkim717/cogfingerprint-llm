>## The Quiet Disappearance of Reliable Gear

It's funny how things you rely on just...vanish. Lately, I've been chasing down touring tire options for my 650b wheels, and it’s been a frustrating hunt. Remember the Schwalbe Marathons? Legendary for their durability, practically indestructible. Now, seemingly gone. And finding good quality latex tubes? Forget about it. 

It's more than just the tires and tubes, though. It's a feeling. Like a little piece of the cycling world I knew is fading. I’m adapting, of course, researching alternatives, embracing new tech. But there’s a pang of nostalgia for the dependable, the tried-and-true. It makes you appreciate what you have, and wonder what else will quietly disappear along the way. Anyone else feeling this shift?
