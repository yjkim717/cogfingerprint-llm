As I hit the trails on my trusty 650b bike in 2024, I faced a frustrating reality: Schwalbe had discontinued their beloved Marathon tires for 27.5 TLE. A loyal fan of their durability and performance, I was left scrambling for alternatives that could match their quality. I'm not alone in this quest; many cyclists are on the hunt for reliable tubeless tires and latex tubes. I'm sharing my journey to help fellow riders navigate this challenge and discover new favorites that'll keep us rolling with confidence.
