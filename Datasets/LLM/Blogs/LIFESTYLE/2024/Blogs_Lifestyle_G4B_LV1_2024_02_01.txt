**Chasing ‘Fire’ & French Fields: Our Semi-Nomadic Year**

2024 feels…wild. Leo’s in Year 3 of homeschooling, and honestly, it’s been a beautiful chaos. We’ve ditched the traditional 9-to-5, chasing a quieter dream of financial independence and a life rich in experiences. 

It started with a crazy idea – combining international travel with a flexible education. We’re currently nestled in a tiny village in France, learning about medieval history while sipping café au lait.  

Let me be honest, the high cost of living is a constant juggle. Ramen nights are still a thing! But the moments – Leo sketching the local vineyards, us hiking through lavender fields – those outweigh everything. 

We’re documenting this whole 'fire' journey (that’s our term for building a life of freedom) on our Instagram – @[Insert Fictional Handle Here].  Anyone else feeling the pull of a different path? Let’s connect! #semiNomadic #homeschooling #financialfreedom
