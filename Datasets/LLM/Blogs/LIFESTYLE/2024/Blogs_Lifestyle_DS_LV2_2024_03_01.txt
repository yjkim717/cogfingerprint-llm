### Two Years Sober and My Higher Power is a Coffee Pot

If you’d told me two years ago that I’d be writing this from a place of quiet contentment, I’d have laughed in your face—a bitter, hollow sound that was my default back then. My life wasn’t a rock-bottom story you see in movies; it was a slow, sinking feeling, like watching the tide go out and realizing you’re stranded. In 2022, I finally admitted I was tired of being the architect of my own chaos.

Enter the Big Book and the 12 Steps. I’ll be honest, the language felt archaic at first. “Higher power”? “Power greater than ourselves”? As a modern, self-sufficient person, my higher power had been my own stubborn will, and look where that got me. I had to get creative. In the beginning, my higher power was the collective wisdom in the rooms of AA. It was the stranger who handed me a coffee and said, “Keep coming back.” It was, quite literally, the coffee pot that was always brewing—a small, consistent source of warmth and sustenance. It was a start.

The real game-changer, the thing that transformed this from a white-knuckle abstinence into a genuine journey, was sponsorship. My sponsor, Sarah, didn’t have all the answers. But she had a flashlight. When I was lost in the dark woods of my own resentments and fears, she’d shine a light on the next step, literally. “Just do Step Four,” she’d say. “Don’t worry about Five yet.” She taught me that the steps aren’t a punishment; they’re a set of tools for building a life you don’t want to escape from.

Working the steps rigorously, as the summary says, meant I had to get brutally honest. I had to make amends to people I’d hurt, including myself. It was terrifying and humbling. But on the other side of that discomfort was a freedom I’d never known. The weight of my past mistakes began to lift. I wasn’t “cured,” but I was no longer haunted.

So, what does this sober lifestyle look like in 2024? It’s not about deprivation. It’s about presence. It’s waking up without a fog of shame. It’s being able to handle a stressful work deadline without my first thought being a glass of wine. It’s actually *remembering* the deep conversations I have with friends.

My higher power has evolved, too. It’s less about a coffee pot now and more about the connective thread I feel to the universe—the synchronicity, the quiet intuition, the profound sense that I’m not alone in this. This journey taught me that a “higher power” can just be the willingness to believe that there might be a better way, and the courage to ask for directions.

If any of this resonates with you, wherever you are on your own path, know this: the most powerful step is always the next one. And there’s always more coffee.
