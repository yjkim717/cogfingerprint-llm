## That Static Feeling... and the Stories We Crave

There's a certain unsettling fascination I've been noticing lately. It started with a Reddit thread about audio dramas â€“ folks searching for that 'War of the Worlds' vibe, but with a modern twist: paranormal entities, shadowy government agencies, and the eerie hum of SETI signals. It got me thinking... aren't we all, in a way, searching for something beyond the everyday? That quiet static, that sense that *something* else is out there, whispering just beyond our grasp? Maybe the stories we crave reflect a deeper longing for the unknown.
