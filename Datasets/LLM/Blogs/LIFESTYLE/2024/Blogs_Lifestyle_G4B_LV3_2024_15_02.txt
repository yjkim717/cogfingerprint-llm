**The Digital Disconnect & That Away Game Ticket**

It’s funny how something as simple as buying a ticket for an away game can suddenly feel…well, frustrating. I was trying to snag a ticket for the lads to see our team play in Manchester last month, and got completely tangled up in a tech glitch. Seriously, the website just froze, spinning endlessly! 

It’s a small thing, I know, but it really highlighted how reliant we’ve become on these digital systems. There’s a weird disconnect when technology fails us, isn’t there?  Suddenly, you're left with uncertainty, a little bit of anxiety about whether that order ever actually went through.  It made me think about how important it is to remember the satisfaction of a straightforward, human interaction – a phone call, a shared smile at the box office.  Maybe I’ll stick to that next time!
