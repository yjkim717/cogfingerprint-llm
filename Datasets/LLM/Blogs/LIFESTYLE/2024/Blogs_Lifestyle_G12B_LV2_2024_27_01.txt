## The Spreadsheet Stared Back (and I Realized Something)

It’s 2024, and the pressure to have *everything* figured out feels…intense. I recently heard a story about an MBA candidate in India, brilliant in so many ways, who was passed over because their take-home assignment didn't showcase enough quantitative prowess. It hit me hard. We’re all being judged on these narrow metrics, aren't we?

I’ve spent years chasing a certain image of "success," feeling like I needed to be a master of spreadsheets and data. But life isn't a perfectly balanced equation. It’s messy, creative, and thrives on diverse skills. Maybe embracing the things I *do* excel at – the storytelling, the connection, the empathy – is just as valuable. Maybe it’s *more* valuable.
