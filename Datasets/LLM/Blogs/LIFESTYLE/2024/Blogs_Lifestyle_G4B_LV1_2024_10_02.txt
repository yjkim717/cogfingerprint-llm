**The Unexpected Armor of Fear**

It’s weird, right? Being sober in 2024 feels… different. Not necessarily *better*, just… different. For a long time, I thought my biggest weapon against the pull of alcohol was willpower. But lately, I’ve realized it’s been something far more primal: fear. 

Honestly, the *fear* of what would happen if I gave in – the shame, the regret, the loss of control – has been a surprisingly effective deterrent. It’s not a pleasant feeling, of course. It’s a sharp, insistent knot in my stomach. But it’s become this strange, protective layer. 

I’m still battling cravings, still having those moments of “just one,” but now I recognize them as opportunities to actively lean into that fear. It’s shifted my perspective, honestly. It’s not about *not* wanting it, it’s about wanting *this* – a life without that shadow.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, or perhaps explore a specific aspect of the ideas further (e.g., focusing more on a particular type of fear)?
