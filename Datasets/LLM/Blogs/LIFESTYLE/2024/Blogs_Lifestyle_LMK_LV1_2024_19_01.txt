As I sit here surrounded by the quiet of my smart home, I'm reminded of the journey it took to get here. With a budget of $700-800, I was determined to create a seamless integration of security, convenience, and innovation. I opted for a mini PC to power my Blue Iris setup, which now effortlessly handles my IP cameras, providing a crystal-clear feed and intelligent motion detection through Deepstack. But it wasn't just about security - I also wanted to tie in my home automation system, making it easy to control the lights, thermostat, and more from a single interface. The result is a haven that's not only secure but also tailored to my lifestyle. As I look to the future, I'm excited to see how my setup will continue to evolve, adapting to new technologies and making my life even more effortless in 2024 and beyond.
