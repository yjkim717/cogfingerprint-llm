It’s 2024, and I’ll admit—I never thought I’d be having a heart-to-heart with my Wi-Fi. But here we are. Living in a bustling apartment building, my Quest and I were constantly wrestling with lag and pixelated worlds, no matter how close I stood to the main router. Virtual Desktop felt more like a virtual disappointment.

Then a friend suggested something simple but game-changing: a dedicated Wi-Fi 6e router, set up as an access point just for my headset. I was skeptical. Another gadget? Really?

But the moment I connected, it was like stepping out of a fog. No more interference from neighbors’ networks or my own streaming habits. Just a clean, uninterrupted signal. It wasn’t just a tech upgrade—it was reclaiming my little corner of the metaverse. Sometimes, the quest for better connection isn’t just about the hardware; it’s about carving out your own quiet space in a noisy world.
