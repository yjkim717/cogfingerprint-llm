It’s been over two weeks since I first tested positive, and I thought I was in the clear—until this morning. Woke up feeling like I’d been hit by a truck: the fatigue is back with a vengeance, and my home test just lit up bright red again. Is this the infamous COVID rebound I’ve been hearing about?

I’m torn about reaching for that Paxlovid course I have left. Part of me wonders if my body just needs more time to fight this on its own. In a strange way, this rollercoaster has reminded me to slow down and listen—really listen—to what my health is telling me. Maybe that’s the lesson hiding in all this fatigue.
