As I sat with Yaa Gyasi's 'Homegoing' in 2024, I was struck by the eerie relevance of its themes to our current world. This powerful historical novel, tracing the legacy of slavery and racism through generations, made me reflect on my own life and the subtle ways systemic injustices seep into our daily experiences. Gyasi's masterful storytelling not only educated me but also prompted a deeper examination of my own biases and privileges. If you're looking for a thought-provoking read that will linger long after you finish the last page, I highly recommend 'Homegoing' - it's a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of our world.
