As we navigate 2024, our lives are busier than ever. I've been searching for ways to simplify my schedule management. I'm on the hunt for an Android app that lets me add calendar events with ease - either by scanning an image or giving a voice command. Being able to choose the calendar would be a bonus. Has anyone found a gem? I'm eager to discover a hassle-free solution to stay organized and focused on what matters.
