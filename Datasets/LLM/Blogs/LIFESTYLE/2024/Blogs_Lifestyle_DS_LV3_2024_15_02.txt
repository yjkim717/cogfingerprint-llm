It was supposed to be simple: a few clicks to secure my away ticket for the big match. As a loyal season ticket holder, I’d done this countless times before. But this time, the website crashed mid-transaction, leaving me in a digital void.

The bank shows the charge went through, and my profile lists the upcoming game, yet I have no email confirmation, no order reference—nothing but a sinking feeling. It’s 2024, and we’re promised seamless tech, but here I am, caught in a glitch, my plans hanging by a thread. It’s a stark reminder that in our hyper-connected lives, a single crash can still leave you feeling utterly powerless and unseen.
