When Mint announced its shutdown last month, my stomach dropped. That app was my financial compass for years! Desperate, I dove into Reddit threads and discovered Monarch Money. Skeptical but curious, I started their free trial.

Three weeks in, I'm not just tracking expenses—I'm having honest conversations with my spending habits. Monarch’s clean interface makes budgeting feel less like a chore and more like a mindful practice. It’s funny how a forced change can lead to a better system. My wallet and my peace of mind are finally on the same page.
