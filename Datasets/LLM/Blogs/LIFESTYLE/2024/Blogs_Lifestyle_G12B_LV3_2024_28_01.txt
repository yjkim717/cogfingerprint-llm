## The Disappearing Gear & the Search for Smooth Rides

It’s 2024, and I’m feeling a little… adrift in the cycling world. My trusty Schwalbe Marathon tubeless tires, the ones that made my 27.5 inch wheels roll like a dream, have been discontinued. Seriously? It’s a frustrating reminder that even the best things don’t always last. 

And it's not just the tires! Finding 27.5 inch latex tubes is proving to be a real challenge too. It feels like a niche size is slowly fading away. This whole experience has got me thinking about how things change, and the bittersweet feeling of letting go of reliable gear while searching for the next adventure on two wheels. Any recommendations for a good tubeless 27.5 tire out there?
