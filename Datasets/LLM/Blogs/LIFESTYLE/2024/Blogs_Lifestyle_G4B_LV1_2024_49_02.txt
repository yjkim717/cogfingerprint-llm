**Friends, Reality, and That Awkward Erasmus Email**

Okay, let’s be honest – how much of our friendship ideals are fueled by binge-watching? I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about the utterly *perfect* friendships depicted on shows like *Friends*. Like, always-laughing, always-supporting, always-knowing-exactly-what-to-say. It feels… a little manufactured, doesn't it?

My own friendships have been a lot messier, a lot more reliant on apologies after a slightly clumsy comment or a missed birthday. And honestly, that’s *better*. 

I was just wrestling with this while trying to draft an email to a friend from my Erasmus year – a slightly awkward, rambling message about catching up. It reminded me that real connection isn’t about flawless portrayals, but about the effort of showing up, even when it's a little uncomfortable.  Maybe we should all dial down the expectations and embrace the beautiful, imperfect reality of our friendships.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a particular aspect of the original summary?
