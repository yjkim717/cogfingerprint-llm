Stepping out of Belfast International, the exhaustion of my Chicago flight clung to me. My phone, stubbornly searching for a signal, made ride-sharing a fantasy. I needed a reliable taxi, and fast.

That’s when I spotted the familiar Fonacab sign—a beacon of local transport. The driver, with a warm, easy-going manner, didn’t just drive; he narrated our journey through the city’s vibrant streets, pointing out spots a tourist like me would otherwise miss.

In that moment, I was reminded that sometimes the best travel experiences aren’t found on an app, but in a simple, human connection. It was the perfect, unplanned start to my Belfast adventure, turning a logistical worry into a cherished memory.
