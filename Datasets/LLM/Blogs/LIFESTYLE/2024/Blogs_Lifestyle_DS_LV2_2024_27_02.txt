**The Unseen Cost of "Getting It Right"**

2024 was supposed to be my year of flawless execution. Instead, I’ve become intimately acquainted with the sting of small, repeated mistakes at work. I’d pour over my tasks, double-checking everything, only to miss a tiny detail that felt colossal.

The frustration was a physical weight, and the whisper of "imposter syndrome" became a constant companion. Was I just not cut out for this?

But a mentor recently asked me a simple, grounding question: "Are you the same person you were when you made that first error?" The answer was a resounding no. Each stumble, as painful as it was, forced a level of growth I’d never have sought from a place of comfort. The goal isn't perfection; it's progress, one messy lesson at a time.
