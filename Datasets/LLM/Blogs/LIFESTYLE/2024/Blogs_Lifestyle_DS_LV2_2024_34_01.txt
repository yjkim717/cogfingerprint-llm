That voicemail from QTC about my C&P exam glitch threw me. It’s 2024, and tech fails still derail our lives. But it reminded me: life’s full of rescheduled plans. Instead of stressing, I brewed some tea and watched the sunset. Sometimes, the universe just hits pause, asking us to breathe and trust the process again. Maybe the delay is a hidden gift.
