## The Unexpected Joy of Yarn Hunting (and Mittens!)

Anyone else find themselves down a rabbit hole searching for *the* perfect yarn? I am! Currently on a quest for a dark gray, DK weight baby alpaca – specifically for a gorgeous Fox & Folk mitten pattern I’m eyeing. My usual go-to is sold out, which, honestly, has led to some delightful online browsing. It’s a little reminder that sometimes, the detour is just as lovely as the destination. Wish me luck finding the perfect cozy match!
