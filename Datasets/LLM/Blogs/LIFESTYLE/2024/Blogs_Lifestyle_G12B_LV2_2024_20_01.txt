## The Weight of a Good Find

There's something magical about travel, isn't there? Not just the sights, but the *feel* of a place seeping into your soul. I'm currently dreaming of northern Italy – imagining cobblestone streets and the scent of leather. I’ve been chatting with a friend planning a trip, and she’s on a mission: to find the perfect, affordable leather bag. Specifically, a beaded clutch!

It got me thinking about my own travel treasures. A small, worn leather journal from Morocco holds more memories than any photo album. It's a tangible piece of a journey. Maybe she’ll find that perfect clutch, a little sparkle against the Italian sun. And I hope, more than anything, it carries a story.
