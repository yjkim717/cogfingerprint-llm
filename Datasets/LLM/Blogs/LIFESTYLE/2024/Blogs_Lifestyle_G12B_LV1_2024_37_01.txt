>## The Quiet Comfort of a New Project

There's something so grounding about settling into a new knitting project, isn't there? Lately, life has felt a bit…scattered. Juggling work, family, and the ever-present buzz of 2024 feels like a constant balancing act. So, I decided to find some solace in the familiar click of needles.

I'm tackling a pair of Fox & Folk mitts, a pattern I've admired for ages. But my usual go-to – Plymouth Baby Alpaca – is proving elusive! It's sparked a little yarn hunt, a quest for that perfect, soft, dark grey DK weight. It's surprisingly meditative, browsing online shops and comparing fiber content. Hopefully, I’ll find something that brings the same cozy feeling to these mitts, and a little peace to my week.
