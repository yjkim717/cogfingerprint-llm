It’s 2024, and life still throws curveballs that no one prepares you for. My sister’s husband is incarcerated, and she’s navigating it all while legally married, raising their two kids alone. We spent hours on a VERA call, untangling VA benefits and income limits—it’s a maze of rules when you’re just trying to stay afloat. It’s a stark reminder that resilience isn’t about having all the answers, but about showing up, asking questions, and holding onto hope even when the system feels stacked against you.
