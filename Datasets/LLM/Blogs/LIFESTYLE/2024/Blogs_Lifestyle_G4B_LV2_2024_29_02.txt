**Seeking Clarity with a Deck**

There’s something so comforting about a little ritual, isn’t there? Lately, I’ve been dipping my toes into tarot readings – specifically, those gentle yes/no questions. It’s surprisingly helpful to step back and ask yourself a question, then let the cards offer a fresh perspective. 

I’m careful to keep it light, steering clear of anything too heavy like health or family matters. It’s just a little nudge, a way to center myself amidst the chaos of 2024.  Anyone else find solace in a simple card pull?
