The rain patters steadily on the roof, and I watch our kids sprawled in their dedicated bunk room, lost in a board game. Last trip, they were crammed on a standard bunk, bickering over elbow room. This small, enclosed space has been a game-changer for our family travels in 2024. It’s not just a sleeping area; it’s their rainy-day sanctuary, a pocket of peace that makes the open road feel a little more like home.
