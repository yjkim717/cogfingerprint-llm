There’s something undeniably hopeful about a fresh Sephora bag waiting by the door. In 2024, my relationship with beauty has shifted; it’s less about covering up and more about the ritual. Unwrapping each product—a velvety cream, a vibrant eyeshadow palette—feels like setting intentions for the weeks ahead.

This little haul isn't just makeup and skincare; it's a promise to myself. A few quiet minutes each morning for that serum, a pop of color to lift my mood on a grey day. It’s self-care that fits right into my busy life, a small, tangible joy. In a world that often demands so much, these simple acts of choosing what makes me feel good are powerfully grounding. Here’s to finding pockets of peace, one product at a time.
