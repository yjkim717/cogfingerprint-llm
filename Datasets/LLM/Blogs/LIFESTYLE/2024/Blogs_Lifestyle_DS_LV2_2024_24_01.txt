Remember those early pandemic days when we all dreamed of escaping to the countryside? I certainly do. I spent 2022 in a small village, seduced by the quiet and the space. But by 2024, I found myself drawn back to the city’s magnetic pull.

It wasn’t a simple reversal. That time away changed my definition of “home.” I no longer crave the non-stop urban buzz, but I also missed the spontaneous conversations, the diverse faces, and the energy that hums through city streets after dark.

Now, I’ve settled in a regenerated town—a sort of “urban village” with community gardens and independent shops. It offers a middle ground. The lesson? It’s not about rural versus urban. It’s about crafting a life that blends the peace we discovered with the vibrant connection we rediscovered. The great migration wasn't a one-way trip; it was a journey to find a new balance.
