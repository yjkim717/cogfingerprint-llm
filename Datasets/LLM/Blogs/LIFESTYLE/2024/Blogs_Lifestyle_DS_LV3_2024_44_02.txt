You know, it’s funny how much running a little corner of the internet can teach you about balance. When we brought on new moderators for our community earlier this year, it wasn’t just about enforcing rules—it was about nurturing a space where everyone feels they belong.

We’d noticed a trend, what some lovingly called “hornyposting.” It’s natural, right? Passion fuels fandom. But we wanted to steer that energy into something creative and respectful. So, we set a simple guideline: fanart is fantastic, especially when it’s inspired by the official, beloved sources we all share. But explicit content? That crosses a line. It’s about celebrating inspiration without letting things get uncomfortable or unwelcoming.

What’s emerged is this beautiful, dynamic space. People share stunning artwork, dive into deep discussions about character arcs, and even debate lore—all while respecting each other’s boundaries. It feels like we’ve struck that delicate balance between freedom and respect, passion and principle.

In 2024, finding communities that foster both creativity and kindness feels like a rare gift. Ours isn’t perfect, but it’s real, and it’s growing—together.
