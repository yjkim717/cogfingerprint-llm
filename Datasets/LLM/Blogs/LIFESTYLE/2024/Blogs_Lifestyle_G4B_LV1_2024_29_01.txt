**Tracing Roots – And Why It Matters**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we can get caught up in the *doing* of life – the daily grind, the social media scroll, the endless to-do lists. But lately, I’ve been feeling this insistent pull to dig a little deeper, to understand where I *really* come from. 

I was reading ‘Homegoing’ by Yaa Gyasi recently, and it completely shook me. The way she weaves together generations impacted by slavery and the enduring legacy of race… it’s a brutal, beautiful, and utterly necessary read. It really got me thinking about family history – not just the names and dates, but the untold stories, the silences, the ways trauma echoes through time. 

Maybe it's a millennial thing, this need to connect with something bigger than ourselves. But I think it’s fundamentally human.  Taking the time to explore those roots, even the uncomfortable ones, feels like a vital part of building a more honest and grounded life in 2024.
