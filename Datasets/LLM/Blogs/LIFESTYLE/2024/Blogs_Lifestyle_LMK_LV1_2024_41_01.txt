As I scroll through my Reddit feed on my phone, I'm hit with a wave of NSFW content that I just didn't sign up for. I'm all for exploring my interests on the platform, but some subreddits are just too much. In 2024, I'm surprised Reddit's mobile app still doesn't have a robust blocking feature for subreddits. I've resorted to hiding 'gonewild' and other explicit subs, but it's a cat-and-mouse game. I'm not alone in seeking a more curated 'Latest' feed. Has anyone found a solution to tame the NSFW beast and make Reddit mobile more enjoyable?
