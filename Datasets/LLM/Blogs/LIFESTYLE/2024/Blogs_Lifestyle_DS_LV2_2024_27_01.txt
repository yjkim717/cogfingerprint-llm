That rejection email stung. After pouring hours into a qualitative take-home assignment, the generic “we’re moving forward with other candidates” felt like a personal failure. But stepping back, I see it differently now. It wasn't a verdict on my skills, but a mismatch in expectations. Sometimes, the best career move is the one you don't make, freeing you for an opportunity that truly fits your unique story.
