## The Unexpected Clarity of a Simple "Yes" or "No"

It's funny how sometimes the biggest life decisions feel so murky. Lately, I've been experimenting with tarot for a bit of guidance – specifically, just asking simple yes/no questions. It’s surprisingly effective! No long, winding narratives, just a direct answer. It’s helped me cut through the noise and trust my gut a little more. Anyone else find clarity in the unexpected? ✨ #tarot #intuition #lifestyle #2024
