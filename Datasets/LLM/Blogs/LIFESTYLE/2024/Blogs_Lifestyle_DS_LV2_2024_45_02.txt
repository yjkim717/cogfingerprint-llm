When Mint announced its shutdown last month, my budget spreadsheet groaned in protest. I’d relied on it for years. On a whim, I signed up for Monarch Money’s free trial, expecting another clunky tool. Instead, I found clarity. For the first time, I could actually see where my money was going—and why. It wasn’t just about tracking coffee runs; it was about aligning my spending with the life I wanted to live in 2024. Sometimes, the best new beginnings come from unexpected goodbyes.
