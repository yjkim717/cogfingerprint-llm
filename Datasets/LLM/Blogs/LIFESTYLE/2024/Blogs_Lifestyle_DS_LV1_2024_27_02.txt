It’s 2024, and I thought I had this whole “adulting” thing down—until my manager pulled me aside again. Another data error, despite my late-night double-checks and color-coded spreadsheets. I walked away feeling like a fraud, convinced I was the only one drowning in a sea of tiny mistakes.

But here’s what I’m learning: competence isn’t about perfection. It’s about how you respond when things go wrong. Instead of spiraling into shame, I’m trying to pause, breathe, and ask, “What’s the real lesson here?” Maybe it’s slowing down, or asking for help sooner. Growth isn’t a straight line—it’s messy, human, and full of second chances. And honestly? I’m starting to be okay with that.
