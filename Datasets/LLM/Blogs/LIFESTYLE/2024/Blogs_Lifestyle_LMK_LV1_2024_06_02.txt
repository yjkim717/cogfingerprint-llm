"As I settled into our week-long Provincetown rental on Cape Cod in 2024, I realized navigating town parking was a challenge. I discovered that Provincetown has a mix of daily and weekly parking options, with specific regulations to keep in mind. To avoid fines, I opted for a weekly town parking pass. It was a small price to pay for the freedom to explore this vibrant town without worrying about my car's parking meter."
