There’s a certain rhythm to life on two wheels—the hum of tires on pavement, the steady cadence of a long tour. But lately, that rhythm’s been interrupted. Ever since Schwalbe stopped making their 27.5 Marathon tubeless tires, finding a worthy replacement has felt like a quest. I’ve tried butyl tubes, even hunted down elusive latex ones, all in pursuit of that perfect balance: durability without sacrificing that smooth, low rolling resistance. It’s funny how a simple tire change can make you reflect on the journey itself—and what we’re willing to search for to keep moving forward.
