As I sit here surrounded by the hum of my home automation system, I'm reminded of the transformative power of technology in our daily lives. In 2024, the lines between convenience and complexity are increasingly blurred. I'm on a mission to optimize my setup, and that means finding the perfect hardware to run Blue Iris, CodeProject/DeepStack, and my home automation hub. With three Amcrest cameras to integrate, I'm stuck between a mini PC and a NAS, all within a budget of $700-800. It's not just about the tech, though - it's about creating a seamless experience that makes life easier. As I navigate the world of IP cameras and home automation, I'm forced to confront my own needs and priorities. What does "smart home" really mean to me? Is it just a buzzword, or a gateway to a more streamlined, stress-free existence?
