There’s something grounding about choosing yarn in 2024, a year that still feels digitally frantic. My fingers lingered over the screen, searching for that perfect dark gray, DK weight baby alpaca. It wasn't just about the Fox and Folk mitts pattern; it was a quiet promise to myself. A small, tactile rebellion against the rush, a future of cozy mornings with handcrafted warmth. Sometimes, the simplest choices—like the softness of alpaca—feel like the most profound anchors to a slower, more intentional life.
