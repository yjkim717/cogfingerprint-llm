>## Tentatively Tenting: A Lesson in Letting Go (and Looping in a Rental Car)

Okay, so, I did something completely out of my comfort zone last weekend. I went camping. Like, *real* camping. In Acadia National Park, no less! It all started with a vague Instagram wanderlust and a sudden urge to disconnect. 

Being an international visitor, used to city conveniences, the idea of pitching a tent felt… daunting. Thankfully, a little research (and a very helpful rental car for hauling gear!) made it manageable. There's a beautiful simplicity in setting up a little haven in the woods, figuring out the tent poles, and realizing you *can* do it. 

It wasn’t glamorous – definitely a few tangled ropes and a slightly lopsided tent – but it was incredibly freeing. A weekend of fresh air, starry nights, and the quiet hum of nature reminded me that sometimes, the best experiences are the ones that push you just a little bit outside your perfectly planned routine. Already dreaming of the next adventure!
