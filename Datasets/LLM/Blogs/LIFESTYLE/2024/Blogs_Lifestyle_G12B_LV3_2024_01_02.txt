## The Weight of Wonderful Things

Isn't it funny how our passions can evolve? I’m currently parting with a beautiful bottle of Roja Oceania – a fragrance I genuinely adored. My collection has simply become…too much! It's a bittersweet feeling, letting go of something lovely, but also a reminder that sometimes, space for new discoveries is just as important as holding onto the familiar. Anyone interested in trading or buying?
