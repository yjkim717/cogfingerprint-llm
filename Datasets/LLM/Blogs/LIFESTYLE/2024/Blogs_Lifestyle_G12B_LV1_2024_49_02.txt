## The Myth of the Central Perk Crew: Are We Expecting Too Much From Our Friendships?

Okay, let’s be real. How many of us have, at some point, looked at *Friends* or *How I Met Your Mother* and felt a pang of… something? Nostalgia, sure, but also maybe a little twinge of loneliness? Those shows, with their perfectly orchestrated group dynamics, their constant hangouts at coffee shops, and the effortless support system, have ingrained a certain ideal of friendship into our collective consciousness.

And in 2024, when we're all juggling side hustles, remote work, online degrees, and the ever-present pressure to *optimize* every aspect of our lives, that ideal feels… increasingly out of reach.

I was thinking about this the other day while scrolling through Instagram (as one does). I saw a post from a friend who’d just spent the weekend with a group of people, all laughing, hiking, and generally radiating peak friendship vibes. It was lovely, genuinely. But it also sparked a weird feeling. A sense of…expectation? Like, *shouldn't* I be doing that? Shouldn’t my life look like a curated highlight reel of constant connection?

Then it hit me. That’s not how life works anymore. My Erasmus exchange years were probably the closest I've come to that level of constant camaraderie. Living in a new city, relying on a small group for everything – it was a beautiful, intense experience. But those days are gone. Now, I’m spread thin. My friends are spread thin. We’re all navigating our own individual journeys, often in different cities, with demanding careers and families.

Does that mean we don't value friendship? Absolutely not. It just means our friendships look different. They’re more intentional, more focused on quality over quantity. A quick phone call, a thoughtful text, a rare but cherished weekend getaway – those are the moments that matter now.

Maybe the sitcoms weren’t wrong, exactly. Maybe they just depicted a specific, concentrated period of life. And maybe, just maybe, letting go of the expectation of a perpetually-hanging-out-at-Central-Perk crew can actually free us to appreciate the truly meaningful connections we *do* have. What do you think?
