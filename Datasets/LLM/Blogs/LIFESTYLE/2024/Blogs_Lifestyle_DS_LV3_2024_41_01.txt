It’s 2024, and my Reddit mobile app used to be my go-to for inspiration—until NSFW subreddits started creeping into my feed. I’d scroll past cute pets and clever memes, then suddenly, something jarring would appear. It felt like my digital sanctuary was invaded. Determined to reclaim my peace, I dove into settings, hunting for ways to block those subreddits. It took some trial and error, but curating my feed brought back the joy of discovery, minus the unwanted surprises. A small tweak, a huge relief.
