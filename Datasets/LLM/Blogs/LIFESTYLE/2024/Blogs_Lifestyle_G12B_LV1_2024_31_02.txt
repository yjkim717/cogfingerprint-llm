## The Thanksgiving Reset Button

This year, 2024, I'm officially declaring Thanksgiving a "low-key" affair. For years, I’ve chased Pinterest perfection, stressing over elaborate dishes. But honestly? The joy got lost in the prep. This time, I'm prioritizing connection over culinary feats. Think pre-made sides, a simple roasted turkey, and plenty of time for laughter. It's a reset button for my holiday expectations, and I’m already feeling lighter.
