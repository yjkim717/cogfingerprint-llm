**Lost in the Static**

There’s a strange comfort in late-night radio astronomy, isn’t there? Just you, the hum of the equipment, and the endless possibility of… something. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with this idea of “first contact” – not with aliens, but with a feeling of being utterly, beautifully lost. Like stumbling upon a signal, a paranormal echo in the background of our lives. It reminds me of H.G. Wells’ ‘War of the Worlds’ – a sense of unsettling wonder.  Maybe that’s what we all crave, a little bit of that unknown.
