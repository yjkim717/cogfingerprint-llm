The eternal conundrum of concert ticket scalping. As I scrolled through social media in 2024, I couldn't help but wonder - why do we vilify ticket scalpers more than other resellers? We swoon over vintage clothing resellers and antique furniture dealers, but ticket scalpers are met with scorn. Is it because we're protective of live music experiences? Or is it because we're frustrated that we can't get our hands on tickets? Perhaps it's time to rethink our stance on scalping and recognize that a ticket is just a commodity, after all.
