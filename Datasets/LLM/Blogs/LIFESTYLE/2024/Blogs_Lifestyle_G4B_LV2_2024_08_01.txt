**Lost in Translation (and Belfast!)**

Anyone else feel like travel planning is just… a lot? I recently landed in Belfast after a long bus and plane journey, and I was immediately hit with the need to figure out the local scene. It got me thinking about how different our daily routines are, even when we’re just trying to get around. 

I was wrestling with whether to rely on taxis, explore the public transport, or just stubbornly cling to my data plan for navigation. Northern Ireland felt wonderfully unfamiliar – a beautiful contrast to the usual. It’s a reminder that sometimes the best travel moments are the ones where you embrace a little disorientation and just *go*.  What's your go-to travel strategy?
