## My Little Desert Survivor & a Lesson in Patience

It’s wild to think this little *Pachypodium saundersii* has been with me for five years! I inherited it – a bit sad, honestly – and it's become a fascinating project. I’m trying to coax out a bigger caudex (that swollen base!) and shape it into a mini bonsai. It’s a slow process, a real lesson in patience, and a reminder that even neglected things can thrive with a little care. Any pruning tips appreciated!
