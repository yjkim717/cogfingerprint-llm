## The Unexpected Freedom of Letting Go of the Parking Spot

This year, Provincetown felt different. Usually, I’m a stressed-out mess, circling for a street parking spot for what feels like hours. This time, though, I decided to just…let it go. We booked a week-long rental, and I’d mentally prepared for the Grace Hall lot fees. 

But something shifted. Not fighting for a space, not obsessing over meters, freed up so much mental energy. We walked more, discovered hidden side streets, genuinely *enjoyed* the town. It’s a small thing, I know, but realizing I could relinquish control over something so seemingly essential was surprisingly liberating. Maybe 2024 is the year I embrace letting go in other areas too.
