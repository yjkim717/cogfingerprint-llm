## Finding My Green: A Little App, A Lot of Calm

It's funny how small things can shift your perspective. Lately, I've been rediscovering golf â€“ a frustrating, beautiful game. A developer released a simple iOS app called "Pure," tracking course aeration schedules. Sounds niche, right? But it's become a metaphor. Knowing when to pause, when to let things settle (like a freshly aerated green), has translated to my whole week. Less rushing, more mindful moments. Small changes, big impact.
