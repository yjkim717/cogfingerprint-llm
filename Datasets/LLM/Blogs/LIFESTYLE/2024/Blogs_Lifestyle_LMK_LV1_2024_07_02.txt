Navigating bureaucracy can be tough, especially when it comes to veterans benefits. I'm struggling to file for apportionment, but it's a challenge without my estranged husband's SSN. We filed taxes separately in 2024, and now I'm stuck. The contact order from the VA is clear, but I need his number to move forward. Anyone else dealt with this red tape?
