**That Familiar Worry: When COVID Comes Back (Again?)**

It’s 2024, and honestly, the feeling of “almost-but-not-quite” is starting to feel a little… familiar. I saw a post on Reddit the other day about someone dealing with a potential COVID rebound – a really relatable experience, actually. It brought back a wave of that anxious energy we all felt during the height of the pandemic. 

Suddenly, you’re back to staring at a home test, wondering if those mild symptoms are just a lingering echo or something more.  It’s a strange reminder that even with boosters and precautions, this virus still has a knack for popping up when you least expect it. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about how we’ve adapted – the layers of masks, the constant vigilance.  It’s exhausting, and it's okay to acknowledge that lingering worry.  Right now, I'm focusing on boosting my immune system and being extra kind to myself if things don’t go perfectly. What about you? How are *you* navigating this ongoing cycle?
