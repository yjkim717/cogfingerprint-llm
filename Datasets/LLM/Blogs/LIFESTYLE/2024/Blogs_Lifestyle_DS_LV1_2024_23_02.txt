### The White Paper Prison

My official title is “Policy Writer,” but most days I feel more like a professional ghost. I haunt a government-issue desk, two days a week, breathing life into documents that are legally required to be soulless. I’m 23, and my biggest professional challenge is staying awake by 3 PM.

It’s ironic. I became a writer because I love the thrill of a blank page, the potential of a new idea. But here, the ideas are pre-approved, the language is sanitized, and my creativity is measured in how many synonyms for “fiscal oversight” I can conjure. The work itself isn’t hard; it’s the quiet hum of career paralysis that’s deafening.

On my hybrid schedule days at home, I’ll often find myself down a rabbit hole—coding tutorials, graphic design portfolios, even real estate licensing courses. My Notes app is a graveyard of half-born career paths. I’m passionate about so many things, which is just a nicer way of saying I’m terrified of choosing the wrong one. So I stay put, collecting a stable paycheck and a low-grade sense of dread.

The real kicker is the micromanagement. My boss, a lovely woman in every other aspect, needs a Teams message if I’m away from my keyboard for more than ten minutes. On office days, I can feel her gaze from across the room, a silent reminder that my time is not my own. This constant supervision makes the spacious, beige-walled office feel like the smallest room I’ve ever been in.

I know I’m lucky. In 2024, a stable job is a gift. But there’s a gnawing feeling that this safety net is slowly becoming a cage. I’m a writer who has forgotten what it’s like to write something that makes my heart beat faster, a young person with a world of options who feels inexplicably, profoundly stuck. The white papers get written, the policies get filed, and I just wonder when—or if—I’ll get to write my own story.
