**Airport Anxiety & the Unexpected Route**

Anyone else feel that heart-thumping panic when staring down a ridiculously short layover at LAX? I definitely did last month! I was seriously considering a Turo ride â€“ a quick way to bypass the baggage claim chaos. But then, a Reddit thread saved the day. Turns out, Avis, with their dedicated airport service, was shockingly efficient. It was a tiny victory, a reminder that sometimes the simplest solution is the best. A little planning, and a helpful online community, can turn a stressful situation into a surprisingly smooth experience.
