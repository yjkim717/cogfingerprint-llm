## The Static and the Search

It's strange, isn't it, how easily anxiety can latch onto something seemingly benign? Lately, I've been obsessed with radio astronomy. Not in a scientific, calculating way, but with a creeping unease. Ever since listening to an old 'War of the Worlds' broadcast, I've been tuning into the quiet hum of the cosmos, half expecting... something. 

It feels silly, I know. A modern-day panic over Martian invaders. But there's a parallel, I think, to the anxieties of daily life. We're constantly scanning, searching – for connection, for meaning, for a signal that says we’re *seen*. SETI’s tireless work, the constant listening… it mirrors that inner drive, doesn’t it? 

Maybe the real monsters aren’t out there, but the ones we build in our own heads, fueled by the static of uncertainty. I'm trying to focus on the beauty of the quiet, but the thought still lingers: what if we're not alone, and what if that realization isn’t comforting?
