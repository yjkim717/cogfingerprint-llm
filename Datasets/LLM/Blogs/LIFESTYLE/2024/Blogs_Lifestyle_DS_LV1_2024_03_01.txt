### Two Years Sober: What I Found When I Stopped Looking for a Quick Fix

It’s a strange feeling, looking back at a version of yourself you can barely recognize. For me, that person was drowning in 2022. I wasn’t just drinking; I was negotiating with life, constantly trying to find the loophole that would let me have my cake and eat it too, without any of the consequences. Spoiler alert: that loophole doesn’t exist.

My wake-up call wasn’t a single siren, but a quiet, terrifying moment of clarity in a sea of chaos. I was tired. Not just hungover tired, but soul-tired. I finally stumbled into a recovery meeting, not with hope, but with sheer desperation. Someone handed me a copy of the Big Book, and I’ll be honest, I judged it by its cover. It looked dated, almost archaic. But inside, I found the first thing that ever truly made sense—it was like reading my own biography, written by a stranger decades before I was born.

That book introduced me to the 12 Steps, which became my blueprint. I used to think “working the steps” was some kind of punitive homework. I couldn’t have been more wrong. It was more like archaeology. With the guidance of my sponsor, Sarah—a woman with a laugh that could power a small city and the gentle honesty I needed—I started digging. We unearthed resentments I’d been curating for years, fears I’d been medicating, and a whole lot of wreckage from my past.

The hardest part, and the most transformative, was the concept of a “higher power.” As someone who’d long been skeptical of organized religion, I balked. But the program doesn’t demand a definition; it just suggests you stop pretending you’re the one in charge. My higher power today isn’t a guy in the clouds; it’s the collective wisdom of the rooms, the force of connection, the simple, profound truth that I am part of something bigger than my own selfish desires. Letting go of the steering wheel when I thought I was the only one who could drive was the most freeing thing I’ve ever done.

Now, in 2024, I’m celebrating two years of sobriety. The wildest part? The alcohol was never the main problem; it was my solution to everything else. Removing it was just step one. The real work, the 12 Steps, gave me a new solution. It rebuilt my relationships, taught me how to sit with discomfort without running, and showed me how to show up for my life—the good, the bad, and the painfully ordinary.

My life isn’t perfect now. It’s just real. And for the first time, real feels like more than enough. It feels like a gift I get to unwrap, one sober day at a time.
