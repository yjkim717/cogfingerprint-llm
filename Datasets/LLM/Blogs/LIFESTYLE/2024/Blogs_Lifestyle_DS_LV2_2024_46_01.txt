It’s funny how life’s little glitches—like my 3D printer’s thermistor readings going haywire from motor interference—mirror my own distractions. In 2024, we’re all wired for constant input, aren’t we? The buzz of notifications, endless scrolling, it scrambles our focus just like those erratic temps. I’ve started shielding my mind, carving out quiet moments away from the digital noise. It’s not about perfection, but finding clarity amid the chaos. Sometimes, the best upgrades aren’t for our gadgets, but for our souls.
