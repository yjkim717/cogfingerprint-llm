When renovating my small bathroom in 2024, I pondered whether to stagger my LVP flooring. While the long planks didn't necessitate staggering, I wanted to add visual appeal. After some deliberation, I decided to stagger the flooring, and it made a significant difference. The varied pattern created a sense of depth, making the space feel larger. It was a simple DIY decision that elevated the overall aesthetic of my bathroom renovation.
