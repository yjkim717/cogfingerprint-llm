**The Ghost Slideshow Blues**

Anyone else have those moments where you’re *this* close to finishing something amazing, only for it to vanish into thin air? It happened to me last week with a Canva slideshow – beautiful visuals, perfectly timed text, and then… nothing. Just a blank page. 

I spent ages wrestling with it, contacting customer support, even trying Google Slides as a backup. It’s a weirdly unsettling feeling, like a digital ghost snatched my work. It reminded me that even in 2024, technology can be infuriatingly fickle.  It’s a good reminder to back things up, right?
