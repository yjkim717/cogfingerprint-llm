There’s something quietly revolutionary happening in our daily rituals this year. My Sephora cart tells the story: a hydrating lip balm for rushed mornings, a scalp spray for mindful moments, and that one sunscreen I actually look forward to applying. It’s no longer just about skincare or makeup; it’s about curating tiny, personal acts of care. In 2024, our most powerful beauty statement is the gentle, intentional way we choose to care for ourselves.
