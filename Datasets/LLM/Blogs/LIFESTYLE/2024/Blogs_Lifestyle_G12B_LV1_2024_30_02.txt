>## The Unexpected Freedom of Tiny Drones & Big Rules

Okay, so I’ve been obsessed with drones lately. Not the massive, cinematic ones, but the little ones – the ones that fit in your hand and can capture surprisingly beautiful footage. I live near a small airport, which, naturally, made things… complicated. 

Initially, I thought, “Just fly it in the open fields! No big deal!” But then I stumbled down a rabbit hole of FAA regulations, LAANC authorizations, and Part 107 certificates. Suddenly, my casual hobby felt a little less casual.

It’s a weird feeling, isn't it? Wanting to pursue something creative, something fun, and then being confronted with a wall of rules. I spent a frustrating afternoon navigating the LAANC system, realizing that even flying a drone weighing under 250g near an airport requires a bit of paperwork and understanding of airspace restrictions. 

Honestly, it’s been a surprisingly valuable lesson. It’s not about stifling creativity, it’s about responsible engagement. It’s about respecting the airspace and the rules that keep everyone safe. And, weirdly, the process of navigating it all has given me a new appreciation for the freedom – and the responsibility – that comes with it. Now, I’m just looking forward to capturing some beautiful sunrise shots!
