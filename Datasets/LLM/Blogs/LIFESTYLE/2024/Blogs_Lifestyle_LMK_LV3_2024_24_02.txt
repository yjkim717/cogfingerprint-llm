As I scrolled through YouTube in 2024, I stumbled upon an ad that made me pause - a suspiciously convincing AI-generated video promising a cryptocurrency giveaway. It was a stark reminder that online scammers are getting smarter, using deepfakes to deceive. This encounter left me thinking about the importance of staying vigilant online and protecting our digital lives. It's time to be more aware of online security and cautious of potential scams.
