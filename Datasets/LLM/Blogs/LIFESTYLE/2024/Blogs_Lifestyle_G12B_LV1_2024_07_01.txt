>## The Unexpected Weight of "Normal"

It's funny how life throws curveballs, isn't it? Just last year, everything felt… predictable. Now, I'm navigating a whole new landscape, supporting my sister through a situation I never imagined. Her husband's incarcerated, and the VA benefits he’s entitled to are tangled in red tape. The kicker? They’re legally married with kids. 

Suddenly, "normal" feels like a distant memory. There's a constant juggling act – understanding complex income limits, exploring legal avenues, and just being a supportive presence. It’s a stark reminder that life rarely follows a script, and sometimes, the strongest love means picking up the pieces when everything falls apart. It’s messy, it’s challenging, but it’s real.
