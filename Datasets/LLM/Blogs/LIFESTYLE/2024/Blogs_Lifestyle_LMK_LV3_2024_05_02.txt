As I gaze at my neglected P. saundersii, I'm reminded that a little TLC can go a long way. Pruning this succulent isn't just about shaping its caudex; it's about cultivating patience and mindfulness. By embracing the art of bonsai, I'm learning to slow down and appreciate the beauty in imperfection. In 2024, I'm making a commitment to nurture not just my plants, but my own growth too.
