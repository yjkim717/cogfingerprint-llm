The scent of pine filled our rental car as we pulled into Blackwoods Campground. As an international visitor, my first tent setup in Acadia was a comedy of errors—poles akimbo, rainfly inside-out. But under the starlight, that little nylon shelter became home. It’s funny how a weekend with just the essentials—a sturdy tent and simple gear—can remind you that the best adventures often begin with a humble, hands-on start.
