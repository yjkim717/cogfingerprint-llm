**Finding My Footing in the Sober Stream**

It’s 2024, and honestly, life feels…lighter. A few months ago, I was wading through a pretty murky patch, and stumbling across the Reddit stopdrinking community was a complete lifeline. It started as just scrolling, reading others’ sobriety shares, a little voyeuristic, maybe. 

But then something shifted. Sharing my own weekend roundups – the small wins, the inevitable slips – felt strangely freeing.  There’s a real sense of camaraderie in those little recovery stories, a reminder that you’re not alone. 

I’m learning that sobriety isn’t about perfection; it’s about leaning into the messy, imperfect journey.  It’s about finding your footing in this sober stream and knowing there are others paddling alongside you.  Anyone else find a similar supportive community helped them along the way?
