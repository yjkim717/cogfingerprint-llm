There I was, staring at Virgin Media’s £29 retention offer for 500 Mbps. It felt safe, familiar—like that old phone contract I’d held onto for years out of sheer inertia. But something in me shifted this year. Instead of clicking “accept,” I took a deep breath and dove into comparison websites.

It wasn’t just about the broadband. It was a lifestyle choice. A small act of saying, “I deserve the best deal,” not just the easiest one. I spent an evening researching, noting down competitor prices, and even rehearsing a little negotiation script.

The result? A better package and a surprising sense of empowerment. Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is question the default. It’s a lesson I’m carrying into the rest of 2024.
