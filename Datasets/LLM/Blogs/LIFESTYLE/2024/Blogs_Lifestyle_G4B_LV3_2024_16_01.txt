**The Weight of “What Now?”**

It’s 2024, and I’m staring down a very familiar feeling: that unsettling hum of “what now?” I just finished my Computer Engineering degree, and honestly, a little bit of doubt has been clinging to me like static. It’s not about *if* I’m capable – I know I am. It’s about the sheer volume of readily available, instantly deployable web development skills out there. 

Suddenly, my meticulously crafted knowledge of algorithms and circuits feels… less immediately valuable. There’s a real *uncertainty* about where it fits in the current landscape.  I’ve been wrestling with the perceived value of all that study – the late nights, the challenging projects. 

I think a lot of us in my generation are grappling with this. It's okay to feel a little lost when the path ahead isn’t perfectly clear. Recognizing that feeling, acknowledging the doubt, is the first step. It’s about redefining ‘value’ – maybe it’s not just about a specific job title, but about the resilience and problem-solving skills I’ve gained.  It’s about building my own future, one thoughtful step at a time.
