As I scrolled through Reddit's mobile app in 2024, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with the explicit content flooding my 'Latest' feed. It sparked a desire for a more curated experience. Why can't there be a seamless way to filter out NSFW subreddits? A simple content filtering feature would greatly improve user experience, allowing users to engage with the platform without stumbling upon unwanted content. By giving users control over their feed, Reddit can create a more enjoyable and tailored experience, making it a more pleasant part of our daily online routines.
