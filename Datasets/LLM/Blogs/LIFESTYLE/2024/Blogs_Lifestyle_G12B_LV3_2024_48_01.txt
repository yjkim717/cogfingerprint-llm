## The Christmas Eve Dilemma: Turo vs. Tradition (and Why I Chose Avis)

Okay, so picture this: it’s December 2024, and I’ve got an eight-hour layover at LAX. Sounds dreamy, right? Not quite when you need to squeeze in a trip to Yorba Linda to see family on Christmas Eve. Suddenly, the car rental question loomed large. Turo, with its peer-to-peer charm, was tempting. But then I thought about Christmas Eve traffic… and time. 

After some serious deliberation, I went with Avis. Sometimes, the convenience of a traditional rental just wins. Speed and efficiency were key, and I wasn't messing around with potential delays. It felt like the right call, and honestly, getting to my family stress-free was the best gift of all.
