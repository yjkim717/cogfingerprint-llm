## The White-Knuckle Dance of Modern Driving

It's 2024, and somehow, the roads seem… tenser. I was driving home the other day, diligently keeping a safe distance behind the car in front, when *bam* – I felt that familiar surge of anxiety. Someone was tailgating me. 

It’s baffling, isn't it? Like, are we all in such a rush that we can't appreciate the concept of safe following distance? This person was practically breathing down my bumper, and I was *already* going the speed limit! It wasn’t about me driving slow; it was about *their* impatience.

It got me thinking about road rage and the little annoyances that snowball into bigger frustrations. We carry so much stress around with us, and sometimes it manifests in these bizarre, aggressive behaviors. I took a deep breath, reminded myself it wasn't personal, and focused on getting home safely. But the experience left me pondering: are we all just a little too wound up these days? Perhaps a little more space – both on the road and in our minds – is what we all need.
