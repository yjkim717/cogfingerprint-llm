As a sales director in the landscaping industry, I've often found myself torn between dressing professionally for client meetings and practically for outdoor workdays. But in 2024, I'm embracing a new approach: merging professional attire with outdoorsy workwear. By investing in versatile, business-casual pieces that are both stylish and functional, I'm able to seamlessly transition from boardroom presentations to site visits. Moreover, I've come to realize that confident dressing is deeply tied to body positivity. By focusing on what makes me feel good in my own skin, rather than trying to conform to unrealistic standards, I'm able to own my style and project self-assurance. Whether I'm meeting with clients or getting my hands dirty, I'm redefining what it means to dress professionally â€“ and it's liberating. By doing so, I'm not only elevating my personal brand but also promoting a more inclusive and accepting definition of professional attire.
