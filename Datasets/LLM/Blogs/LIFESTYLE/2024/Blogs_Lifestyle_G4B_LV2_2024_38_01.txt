**The Unexpected Kindness of a Golf App**

It’s funny how a little thing can shift your perspective. I recently stumbled across this amazing free app called ‘Pure’ – a golfer’s brainchild dedicated to sharing course aeration updates. Seriously, who thinks about that? It's a testament to the power of a connected golf community. 

It made me think about the small acts of generosity that ripple outwards. Like this app, offering a simple solution to a frustrating problem.  In 2024, with so much digital noise, it’s refreshing to see genuine helpfulness prioritized.  It’s a good reminder to look for those quiet moments of connection.
