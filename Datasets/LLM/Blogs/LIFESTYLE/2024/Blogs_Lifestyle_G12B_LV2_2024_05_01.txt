## A Little Box, A Big Story

Dusting off old boxes this week, I stumbled upon something unexpected: a small, intricately carved wooden box gifted to me years ago by a team of Ukrainian hockey players who stayed with our family. I barely remember the details, just the warmth of their smiles. Now, in 2024, holding this memento sparks a wave of memories and a quiet wish for their safety and well-being. Itâ€™s amazing how a simple gift can hold so much.
