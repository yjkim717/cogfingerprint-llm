**The Worrying Glow of My Phone**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we slip into wanting to know *everything* about the people we love. Last week, my mom sent me a direct message – a pretty insistent one – asking me to install a location tracking app on my phone. Seriously. She just wanted to “check in” and feel a little more secure. 

And honestly, a little part of me understood.  We live in a world where anxieties about safety and connection are constantly amplified. But the thought of her having that constant awareness of my whereabouts felt… suffocating. It felt like a fundamental violation of my privacy, a step too far into the territory of adult responsibility. 

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with it. The ensuing conversation was predictably tense. She worried about me, about my late nights, about the general chaos of being a 23-year-old trying to figure things out. 

It made me think about how quickly we default to control.  Is it actually about care, or just a need to manage our own anxieties?  I’m still wrestling with it. I want to be open and communicative, but I also need to carve out space for my own independence. Maybe the answer isn’t constant monitoring, but a different kind of trust – a trust built on honesty and knowing that, ultimately, I’m capable of making my own choices.  It’s a tricky balance, this whole adulting thing.
