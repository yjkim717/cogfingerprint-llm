As I watched the Detroit Lions soar in 2024, I couldn't help but reflect on my own Buffalo Bills' journey. I recalled the thrill of watching my team rise to prominence, and the pride of being a Bills fan. Now, I'm cheering on the Lions from the sidelines. It's a reminder that success is contagious - and that sometimes, it's okay to celebrate someone else's Super Bowl dreams.
