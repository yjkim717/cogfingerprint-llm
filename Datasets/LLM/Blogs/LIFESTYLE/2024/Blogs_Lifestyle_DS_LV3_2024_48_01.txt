It’s 2024, and I’m staring down a tight layover at LAX, wondering if I made the right choice. Turo felt personal—like borrowing a friend’s car—but holiday traffic had other plans. The minutes ticked by as I navigated bumper-to-bumper chaos, questioning if a traditional rental’s streamlined pickup would’ve saved me. In the end, it wasn’t just about convenience; it was a lesson in weighing time against experience. Sometimes, the road teaches you more than the destination.
