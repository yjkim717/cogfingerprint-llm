## Two Years In: Finding My Own North Star

It’s wild to think it’s been two years. Two years since I made a decision that, frankly, felt terrifying at the time. Two years since I started actively, intentionally, rebuilding my life. I’m talking about sobriety, of course. And while I’m not going to delve into the specifics of *why* I needed that change – everyone’s story is different, right? – I wanted to share a little bit about *how* I found my way, and what the journey has looked like.

For a while, I felt like I was just… drifting. Trying different things, attending the usual support groups, hoping something would “click.” It wasn't that those groups were bad. They weren’t. But they felt… generic, somehow. Like I was searching for a pre-packaged solution that didn’t quite fit. I’d listen to other people’s stories, nodding along, feeling a flicker of connection, but ultimately still feeling lost.

Then, I stumbled upon a deeper dive into the foundational texts, the "Big Book" as it's known. I know, I know, it sounds a bit… intense. But honestly? It was a revelation. It wasn’t about finding a trendy new approach, but about following a set of principles, a roadmap that had helped countless people before me.

What resonated most was the emphasis on personal introspection and a connection to something bigger than myself. The concept of a "Higher Power" – and I want to stress, that’s *completely* personal – became my anchor. It wasn't about subscribing to any specific religious belief; it was about identifying a force, a guiding principle, that offered support and perspective.  For me, it’s been nature, creativity, and a commitment to ethical living.

The steps, laid out so clearly, became my framework. It wasn’t always easy. There were days, weeks even, where I felt like I was backsliding, questioning everything. But working through those steps, honestly and openly, provided a level of clarity I hadn't experienced before.

Two years on, I’m not going to pretend I’ve got all the answers. Sobriety is a daily practice, a constant commitment. But I *do* have a stronger sense of self, a deeper understanding of my values, and a quiet confidence that I can navigate whatever life throws my way. I've learned that sometimes, the most unconventional path is the one that leads you home. And sometimes, the oldest wisdom is still the most relevant.

If you’re out there feeling lost, searching for your own north star, I encourage you to explore different avenues, to dig deep, and to trust your own intuition. There’s a path waiting for you, even if it looks a little different from what everyone else is doing.
