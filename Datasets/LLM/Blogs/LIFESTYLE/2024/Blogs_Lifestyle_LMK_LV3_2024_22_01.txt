As I navigate day 17 of my Covid journey, I'm faced with a familiar foe: rebound symptoms. After a brief reprieve and a negative home test, I'm left wondering if I should revisit Paxlovid. The uncertainty is unsettling, but it's also a reminder that Covid is still an unpredictable companion. I'm learning to roll with the punches, trusting my instincts and the guidance of healthcare professionals. For now, I'll continue to prioritize rest, hydration, and patience â€“ and hope that this too shall pass.
