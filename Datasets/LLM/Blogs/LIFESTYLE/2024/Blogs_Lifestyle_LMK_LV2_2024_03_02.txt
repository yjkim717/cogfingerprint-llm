As I prep for my upcoming Appalachian Trail thru-hike in 2024, I'm stuck on shelter decisions. Ultralight backpacking is all about shaving ounces, but I'm torn between a tarp and a bivy sack. Both have pros and cons - tarps offer more space, but can be windier and wetter; bivy sacks are cozier, but can get steamy. Condensation management is key - I don't want to wake up to a soggy sleeping bag. I'm considering a Preamble shelter, which offers a happy medium. Weighing my options, I'm reminded that backpacking is just as much about the journey as the gear. As I ponder my shelter, I'm forced to reflect on my priorities: is it about speed, comfort, or simplicity? Whatever my choice, I know it'll be a personal one - and that's what makes this journey so exciting.
