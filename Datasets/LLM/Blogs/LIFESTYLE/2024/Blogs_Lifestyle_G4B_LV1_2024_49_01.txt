**Is ‘Friends’ Friendship *Really* Possible?**

Okay, let’s be honest – how many of us have spent an embarrassing amount of time rewatching *Friends*? It’s pure comfort food, right? But lately, I’ve been wrestling with something. Those six characters, navigating life with an almost impossibly perfect group of friends… it feels a little… unrealistic. 

I’m 27 now, and my friendships have shifted and evolved – and honestly, they’re *way* messier than anything Ross and Rachel ever dealt with. I’ve been doing an Erasmus program this year and experiencing friendships from all over Europe, and it’s made me really think about what ‘real’ friendship looks like. 

It's not about constant, perfectly timed coffee dates or dramatic breakups. It’s about the quiet support, the inside jokes, and the acceptance of each other’s chaos. Maybe *Friends* just offered a beautiful, filtered version of a dream we all secretly hold onto.  What about you – are you still clinging to those TV show ideals, or have your friendships grown into something more authentic?
