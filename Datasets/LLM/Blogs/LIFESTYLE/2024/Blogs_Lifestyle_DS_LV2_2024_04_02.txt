It’s funny how a simple thing like my aloe plant tipping over could feel like such a metaphor for 2024. Life’s been a whirlwind lately—work shifts, schedule changes, and suddenly my sturdy little plant couldn’t even stand on its own.

I found it leaning pathetically, a few sunburned leaves telling me I’d been careless with its light. I’d forgotten to water it regularly, forgotten to check in. Sound familiar? We hustle through our days, thinking everything’s fine until something—or someone—shows us it’s not.

Repotting it today felt symbolic. Fresh soil, a better spot by the window, and a small stake for support while it regains its strength. It’s a gentle reminder that we all need adjustments, a little care, and sometimes, something to lean on while we find our footing again.
