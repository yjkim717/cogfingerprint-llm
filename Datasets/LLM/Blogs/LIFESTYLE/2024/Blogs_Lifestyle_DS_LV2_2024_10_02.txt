### The Fear That Keeps Me Safe

It’s 2024, and my life looks nothing like it did a few years ago. Back then, my biggest fear was running out of wine. Today, my most powerful tool in recovery is a healthy, managed fear of ever going back.

People sometimes tell me, "Don't live in fear." I get it. But this isn't the kind of fear that paralyzes me; it’s the kind that protects me. It’s the quiet, sober voice that pipes up when an old trigger appears—a stressful work deadline or a social gathering where everyone is drinking. That voice doesn’t whisper of deprivation; it vividly, and thankfully, reminds me of the chaos I left behind.

It plays the tape forward. It shows me the hangover, the shame, the broken trust, and the slow erosion of the beautiful, present life I’ve built. This mindful fear isn't my enemy; it’s my most loyal guardian. It transforms a fleeting craving into a powerful affirmation of why I choose sobriety, every single day. It’s the respect I have for the gravity of my journey, and the fierce love I have for the peace I finally found.
