It’s 2024, and I just paid a premium for concert tickets—not from the venue, but from a reseller. As I waited in that digital queue, I couldn’t help but wonder: why do we vilify ticket scalpers so much more than, say, the curated vintage shop owner who marks up a rare denim jacket?

Both are resellers. Both hunt for something special and ask more for it. Yet one feels like a betrayal, while the other feels like a treasure hunt. Maybe it’s because music is tied to moments—it’s personal. That ticket isn’t just an item; it’s an authentic experience, a memory waiting to happen. And when someone profits off that emotional connection, it stings differently. Are we paying for the seat, or for the feeling?
