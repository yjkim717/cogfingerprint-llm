## Is it *Really* So Bad to Resell? A Ticket Scalping Reflection

Okay, let's talk about something that’s been buzzing around online lately: concert ticket scalping. I saw a Reddit thread the other day that really got me thinking. Why is reselling tickets such a hot-button issue when we’re *constantly* reselling things? Think about sneakerheads flipping limited-edition shoes, or even the markup on a fancy latte – it’s all about supply and demand, right?

It feels like there's this perception that ticket scalpers are just greedy, but what about the effort involved in securing those tickets in the first place? The late-night queueing, the relentless refreshing… it's a hustle! Maybe we should rethink our judgment and acknowledge that, like it or not, reselling is just a part of the modern marketplace. Thoughts?
