### Are We All Just Living in a TV Friendship Fantasy?

I was rewatching an old comfort show the other night, the one where the friends are perpetually gathered in a coffee shop or on a couch that none of them could realistically afford. You know the one. And as I watched them finish each other’s sentences and drop everything for a crisis, a familiar, nagging thought crept in: *Is my friendship circle broken?*

In 2024, my "central perk" is a group chat. Our deep, soul-baring conversations are often punctuated by hilarious memes and voice notes sent while multitasking. We don’t have a standing weekly dinner date; we have a flurry of DMs trying to coordinate schedules two months in advance.

For a long time, I held my real-life connections up to the TV standard and found them wanting. I wondered why our interactions weren’t always cinematic, why support sometimes came in the form of a heart emoji instead of a dramatic, in-person speech.

But I’ve started to realize the flaw in my thinking. Those perfect TV friendships are a narrative fantasy, a collection of the best, most dramatic moments edited together. They don’t show the six months where the friends were too busy to meet, or the quiet understanding that doesn’t need a grand gesture.

My modern friendships are different, but they are not less. They are resilient, woven through the digital and the real. They are the friend who sends a "thinking of you" text exactly when you need it, or the quick video call that bridges a thousand miles. The depth isn't in the constant proximity; it's in the consistent, low-frequency hum of care that persists through the chaos of adult life. Our connections have evolved, and maybe it's time our expectations did, too. They’re not a lesser version of a TV fantasy—they’re the beautifully messy, resilient reality.
