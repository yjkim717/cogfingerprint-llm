As I declutter my perfume collection in 2024, I'm reminded that some scents are worth holding onto. My nearly full bottle of Roja Oceania is one of them. This luxurious fragrance has become a staple, evoking feelings of serenity and confidence. I'm considering trading it, but parting with it is bittersweet. It's a small pleasure, but one that brings me joy. Is it worth the price tag? For me, it's about savoring the moments it enhances.
