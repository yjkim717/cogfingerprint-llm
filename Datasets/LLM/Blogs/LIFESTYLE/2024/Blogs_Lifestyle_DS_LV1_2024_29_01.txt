### The Echoes in Our Hands

My great-grandmother’s hands were a map of a life I could barely comprehend—veins like rivers, skin like worn leather. She would tell me stories not of kings and queens, but of her grandmother, and her grandmother before that, tales that snaked back through time to a shore in Ghana. She spoke of two sisters, one whose path led into chains across the ocean, and the other who remained, their lives cleaved apart by a brutal, indifferent history.

This isn’t just a family story; it’s the story of our world. In 2024, we talk a lot about legacy—the property we inherit, the money we leave behind. But the real inheritance is subtler and far more powerful. It’s the resilience coded in our DNA, the trauma that whispers in our anxieties, and the unyielding hope that somehow, against all odds, we are still here. It’s the legacy of racism, yes, a stain that persists, but also the legacy of survival.

Understanding this generational saga doesn’t just explain the past; it reframes the present. It asks us to look at the world not as a snapshot, but as a long, unspooling story. And it reminds us that the most profound thing we can do is to acknowledge the weight of that story, and then, with intention, choose how we add our own chapter.
