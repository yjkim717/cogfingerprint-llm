## The Unexpected Comfort of Archetypes

Lately, I've been diving deep into exploring stories – not just novels, but the foundational narratives we inherit. It started with a casual interest in Jungian psychology and how archetypes shape our understanding of the world. Funny enough, it’s seeped into my daily life. 

Suddenly, the "hero's journey" isn’t just a plot device; it’s how I view my own challenges. That feeling of being lost? Maybe it's the "shadow" stage, necessary for growth. It's a little weird, a little woo-woo, but in 2024, finding comfort in ancient patterns feels surprisingly grounding. Maybe we're all just characters in a bigger story after all.
