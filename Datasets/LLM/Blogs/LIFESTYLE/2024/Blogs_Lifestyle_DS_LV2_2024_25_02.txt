It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking a lot about trust lately—how fragile it feels in a world where a stolen credit card can shatter someone’s sense of security. I remember the unease I felt last month when a neighbor’s package went missing, and it made me reflect: our daily choices ripple outward. Living honestly isn’t just about avoiding trouble; it’s about building a life where we can all feel safe and connected, one small act at a time.
