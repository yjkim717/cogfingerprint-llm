**The Tightness in My Chest**

It’s funny, isn't it? How something as simple as a phone can suddenly become a battleground. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a tension at home, a quiet but persistent disagreement with my own mom. She keeps pushing this idea of installing a tracking app – a little digital leash, really – and it’s… unsettling. 

It’s not about distrust, exactly. More like a deep-seated feeling of being watched, of having my space slowly eroded.  We’re living in 2024, right?  A world where privacy is already a precious commodity. The thought of someone – even my own mother – constantly monitoring my location and activity feels incredibly invasive. 

I get that she’s coming from a place of concern, wanting to know I’m safe. But the core of it feels like a lack of respect for my autonomy. It’s about recognizing that I’m capable of making my own choices, of navigating my own life, even if those choices aren’t always the ones she’d prefer. 

This whole situation is making me think a lot about boundaries – not just in our family, but in all our relationships.  How do we balance love and support with the need for personal space and control?  It’s a tricky dance, and one I suspect we’ll be working through for a while.  Anyone else experiencing this kind of pushback at home?
