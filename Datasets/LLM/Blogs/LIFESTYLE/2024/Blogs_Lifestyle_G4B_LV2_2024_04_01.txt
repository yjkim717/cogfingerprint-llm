**Dust, Memories, and a Whole Lot of Questions**

It’s 2024, and life has taken a wonderfully strange turn. I’ve inherited my grandmother’s house – a small, stubbornly charming place nestled deep in a rural area. It’s beautiful, undeniably, but also…complicated. Right now, my biggest worry isn’t the house itself, but figuring out its worth. 

I’m wading through the process of getting an appraisal, trying to understand what “property value” really means in a place like this. It feels a little surreal, like I’m sorting through her life alongside the dust motes dancing in the sunlight. Selling the house feels like a big step, but also a delicate one. More than just a transaction, it's about honoring her memory and figuring out what comes next.
