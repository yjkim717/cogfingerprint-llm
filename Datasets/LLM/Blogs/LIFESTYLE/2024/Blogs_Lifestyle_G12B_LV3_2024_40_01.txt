## The Echoes of Duncan Idaho: Finding Meaning in Cycles of Change

It’s funny the things that can trigger a deep thought these days. I was re-reading *Dune* (yes, still! It’s a perennial favorite) and got completely lost in the character of Duncan Idaho. Not the original, dashing Duncan, but the iterations that follow – particularly Leto II’s strategic, almost unsettling, use of him. And suddenly, I was thinking about *my* life, about cycles, about loss, and about how identity isn't always a straight line.

For those unfamiliar, Duncan Idaho in Frank Herbert’s *Dune* universe is a recurring figure, reborn and re-engineered across millennia. He’s a soldier, a lover, a pawn, a weapon – and yet, something of his essence persists. Leto II, the God Emperor, leverages this persistence, this echo of a man, for his own grand, complex plans. It’s a fascinating, and frankly, a little bit disturbing concept.

But it got me thinking about how our own lives often mirror that cyclical pattern. We experience periods of intense growth, followed by inevitable loss. Relationships shift, careers evolve (or sometimes, abruptly end!), and the people we thought we were morph into someone… slightly different. Sometimes dramatically.

Think about it. How many of you are doing something *completely* different than you envisioned when you were, say, 22? I know I am. My career path has taken some unexpected turns, and the person I am today feels both familiar and utterly foreign to that younger version of myself.

There’s a grief that comes with those shifts, isn't there? A mourning for the “what ifs” and the versions of ourselves we’ve left behind. We cling to memories, to identities we’ve carefully constructed, even as life nudges us toward something new. Maybe that’s a natural human instinct – to resist change, to hold onto the familiar.

But what if, like Duncan Idaho, there’s a core essence that persists, even as the form changes? What if our experiences, our losses, our transformations, aren't erasing us, but rather *refining* us?

Leto II’s manipulation of Duncan highlights a brutal truth: sometimes, we are used, shaped, and molded by forces beyond our control. But even within that manipulation, Duncan retains a flicker of his own will, his own sense of self.

And that’s where the hope lies, I think. In recognizing that even amidst the chaos and the constant change, we have agency. We can choose how we respond to the cycles of our lives.  We can choose to learn from loss, to embrace new opportunities, and to redefine ourselves, not as replacements of who we were, but as evolutions.

This year, 2024, feels particularly… transitional.  So much is shifting, both globally and personally.  Maybe embracing the idea of cyclical change – recognizing that loss can pave the way for growth, that identity is fluid, and that even echoes of our past selves can guide
