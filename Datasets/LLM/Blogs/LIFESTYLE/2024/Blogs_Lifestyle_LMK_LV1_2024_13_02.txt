As I continue to dive into the world of VR gaming with my Oculus Quest, I've been struggling to achieve a seamless experience due to my laggy wireless connection. It's 2024, and I'm still dealing with dropped frames and disconnections - it's like being stuck in the slow lane! To upgrade my setup, I'm on the hunt for an affordable wireless access point that can provide a stable and fast connection. I've been researching the latest WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E routers, and I'm curious about how they can improve my virtual desktop experience. I've also come across AirLink, a feature that promises to enhance my Oculus Quest's wireless connectivity. After some digging, I'm hoping to find the perfect wireless router that won't break the bank. A reliable connection is key to unlocking the full potential of my VR adventures - and I'm excited to see what the future holds!
