## The Data Doesn't Lie (But My Brain Does)

Okay, real talk. This year has been… a learning curve. I landed a fantastic role a few months ago, a real step up, and I *wanted* to crush it. The problem? I’ve been stumbling. A lot. Little things, mostly – missed deadlines, slightly off analyses, that kind of thing. 

And the data? It’s there, staring me in the face. Every spreadsheet, every project timeline, it quietly whispers, “You’re not as good as they thought.” It’s ridiculous, I know. I’m putting in the hours, I'm asking questions, I’m genuinely trying. Yet, that familiar voice of imposter syndrome has been screaming.

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we can discount our efforts when things aren't perfect. I’m trying to shift my mindset, to see these mistakes as data points, not indictments of my intelligence.  Progress, not perfection, right? Still working on it, but acknowledging the feeling is the first step, I think. Anyone else battling this in 2024? Let's commiserate!
