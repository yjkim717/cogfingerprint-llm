## The Beard, the Apnea, and the Quest for a Good Night's Sleep

Okay, so here's a confession: I’m currently wrestling with sleep. Not just the “tossing and turning” kind, but the full-blown, diagnosed-with-sleep-apnea kind. It's been a journey, to say the least. For a while, I was managing with a nasal mask, but lately, I've been waking up with a dry mouth and feeling utterly exhausted. Turns out, I’m a mouth breather when I sleep – who knew?

Now, I'm exploring a full face CPAP mask. The idea is promising, but there’s one *major* hurdle: my beard. I'm not ready to part with it! Shaving feels like a drastic measure, a sacrifice to the sleep gods. 

I stumbled upon a Reddit thread recently where someone else was facing the same dilemma. It was surprisingly comforting to know I wasn’t alone in this. It’s 2024, and shouldn't there be a solution that lets me prioritize my health *and* my facial hair? The search continues – wish me luck! Maybe there's a magical mask out there waiting to be discovered.
