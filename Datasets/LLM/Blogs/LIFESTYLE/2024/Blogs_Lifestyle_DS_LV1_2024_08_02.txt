### Finding My Field-Office Balance

For years, my professional wardrobe felt like a battle between two identities. In the office, I was a Sales Director, needing sharp, authoritative looks. On-site, I was a landscaping enthusiast, requiring durable, practical gear that could handle the elements. As a plus-size woman with a soft dramatic frame—all flowing lines and bold presence—finding clothes that bridged this gap felt impossible. I was either drowning in shapeless polo shirts or squeezing into stiff, unflattering blazers.

2024 became my year of sartorial revolution. I dedicated myself to discovering brands that truly design for real, dynamic bodies. The shift was profound. I found technical, stretch-fabric blazers that move with me from client meetings to garden beds, and elegant, moisture-wicking tunics that highlight my silhouette without sacrificing comfort. It’s more than clothing; it’s about armor that finally fits the entirety of who I am and what I do. I no longer dress for a role—I dress for my life, and the confidence is blooming.
