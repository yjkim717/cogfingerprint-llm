The hum of servers and the glow of monitor lights used to be my world. For over a decade as a telecom technician in Vancouver, that was my normal. But last winter, something shifted. Staring at a tangled mess of fibre optic cables, I had a sudden, vivid image of a different kind of tangle—the anchor line of a boat, descending into the deep, dark green of the Pacific. At 35, I realized I was craving a career that wasn't just about connectivity, but about discovery.

That’s how I landed on commercial diving. The idea of trading my office for the water, of doing year-round work in aquaculture or search and recovery right here in BC, feels less like a pivot and more like an awakening. It’s 2024, and the narrative that your career path is set in stone by thirty is well and truly outdated.

My search now is for the right school, a place that can turn this spark into a sustainable future. I’m not just looking for a certificate; I’m looking for a gateway to a life where my office has no walls and the work is as stable as the tides. It’s daunting, sure, leaving a secure job for the unknown depths. But the thought of a fresh start, of building something meaningful with my own two hands, feels more solid than any desk job ever did. The water is calling, and for the first time in a long time, I’m ready to answer.
