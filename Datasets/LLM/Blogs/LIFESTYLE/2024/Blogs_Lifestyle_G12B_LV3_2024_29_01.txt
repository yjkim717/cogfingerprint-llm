## The Threads That Connect Us: Thinking About Legacy

It's funny how a book can really stick with you, isn't it? I just finished "Homegoing" by Yaa Gyasi, and I'm still processing it. It’s a historical fiction masterpiece, tracing the lives of two sisters separated by the brutal reality of slavery and the ripple effect it has on their families for generations.

What struck me most wasn't just the historical weight – though that was undeniably powerful – but the way it highlighted the interconnectedness of everything. We often think of our lives as separate, individual journeys. But Gyasi’s book made me consider the invisible threads that connect us to the past, to our ancestors, and to each other. 

In 2024, with so much focus on personal branding and individual achievement, it's a potent reminder to look beyond ourselves. To consider the legacies we’re building, and the stories we'll leave behind. It's a call to be mindful of the impact we have, not just on our own lives, but on the generations to come.



Hope this fits the bill!
