As I prepared for my Appalachian Trail thru-hike in 2024, I found myself stuck on a crucial decision: choosing the perfect ultralight shelter. The Protrail and Preamble tarps were top contenders, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. I weighed the pros and cons, considering factors like weight, condensation management, and tick protection. The Protrail's minimalist design and 1.5-pound weight were tempting, but I worried about its ability to keep me dry in heavy rain. On the other hand, the Preamble's clever condensation management system and added tick protection gave me peace of mind, but its 2.2-pound weight made me question whether it was worth the extra ounces. As I pondered, I realized that this decision wasn't just about shelter â€“ it was about the kind of hiker I wanted to be: one who prioritized speed and simplicity, or one who valued comfort and protection.
