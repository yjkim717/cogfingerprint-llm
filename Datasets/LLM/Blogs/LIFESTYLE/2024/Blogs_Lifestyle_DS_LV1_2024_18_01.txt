### The Upstate Equation: More Than Just a College Town

So, the map is pinned on Clinton, NY. A potential job at Hamilton College has my family and me doing the math: can we trade subway lines for sky-wide starry nights?

The initial draw is obvious. The campus is a postcard, and the idea of our kids growing up surrounded by that kind of intellectual energy is a huge plus. But life isn't just campus boundaries. We’re digging into the local schools, imagining weekend hikes through the stunning NY state parks that are practically in the backyard. That’s the dream, right? Trading a crowded playground for a trail through Letchworth or Green Lakes.

Of course, there’s the other side of the equation: the legendary Upstate winters. We’re mentally preparing for the cozy, the quiet, the investment in serious outerwear. And that occasional pang for the city? We’re calculating the train ride to NYC, not as a daily commute, but as a planned adventure. It’s a different rhythm we’re seeking—one where the quiet of a snowy Clinton evening is just as valuable as the energy of a Manhattan afternoon. The balance feels possible here.
