"Tailgating - the ultimate driving pet peeve. As I navigated the crowded highways in 2024, I found myself getting increasingly frustrated with drivers who refuse to keep a safe distance. It's infuriating when you're not the one causing the slowdown! But as I reflected on my own driving habits, I realized I've been guilty of tailgating too. It's a habit that's not only annoying to others, but also puts everyone at risk. Let's all take a deep breath and leave some space - it's a simple step towards a safer, less stressful commute."
