"As I renovated my small bathroom in 2024, I pondered whether to stagger my luxury vinyl plank (LVP) flooring. I wanted a visually appealing space that felt larger. Staggering the planks can add a touch of sophistication, but it also requires more planning. I decided to take the DIY route, and the result was stunning. My bathroom now feels like a luxurious retreat, and I'm loving my new LVP flooring!"
