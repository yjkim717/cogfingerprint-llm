It’s 2024, and I’ve finally found peace on the golf course—thanks to an app called Pure. No more showing up to freshly aerated greens, my mood deflated. Now, a quick check and I know exactly what to expect. It’s a small thing, but it’s reshaped my weekends. Funny how a little tech can carve out more space for simple joy, one fairway at a time.
