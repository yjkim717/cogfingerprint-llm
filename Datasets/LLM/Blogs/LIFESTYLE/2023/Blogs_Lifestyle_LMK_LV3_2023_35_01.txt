"Staying connected across borders can be a challenge. As I settled into my new life in the US in 2023, I wondered if I could retain my Hong Kong phone number. Discovering Smartone's prepaid SIM card and international roaming options was a lifesaver. I could easily top up my account and stay in touch with loved ones back home. It's amazing how a simple SIM card can bridge distances and keep your sense of identity intact."
