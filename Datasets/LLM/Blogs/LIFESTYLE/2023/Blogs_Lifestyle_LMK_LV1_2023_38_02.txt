As I packed up my winter wardrobe this year, I was faced with the daunting task of shipping it back home. With a whopping 10kg of clothes to transport, I was determined to find the most affordable option. My first stop was the post office, where I was quoted a price that left me sticker-shocked. I decided to explore alternative options and stumbled upon Delhivery, a private consigner that promised cheap and reliable delivery. After getting quotes from a few other private consigners as well, I was convinced that Delhivery offered the best deal. To my delight, my clothes arrived safely and on time. The experience taught me that sometimes, it's worth venturing beyond the traditional post office to find a more cost-effective solution. I'm now a convert to using private consigners for my shipping needs - and my wallet is grateful!
