It’s 2023, and I’ve been thinking a lot about that viral clip of the football coach before the Super Bowl—eyes closed, headphones on, visualizing the national anthem before a single note was sung. At first, it seemed like just another pre-game quirk, but it struck a chord with me. How often do we rush through our days without truly picturing what we want to happen?

I’ve started borrowing his approach. Each morning, I take five minutes to close my eyes and vividly imagine my goals—not just as ideas, but with all my senses. The warmth of a successful meeting, the sound of laughter with friends. It’s more than daydreaming; it’s active creation. By blending imagination with intention, I’m finding that what I focus on truly starts to materialize. Try it—you might just manifest your own game-day moment.
