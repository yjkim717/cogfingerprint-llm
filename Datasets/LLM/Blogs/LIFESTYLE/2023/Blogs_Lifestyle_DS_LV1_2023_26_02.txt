Ever since I got that perm back in early 2023, my mornings have been a gamble. I’d fall asleep with these perfect, bouncy waves, only to wake up to a frizzy, sad-looking mess. It felt like my hair had given up overnight! But then I discovered a simple routine: a gentle curl shampoo, a dollop of curl cream scrunched in before bed, and a loose pineapple bun. Now, my revitalized waves greet me each morning—proof that a little nighttime care can transform your whole day.
