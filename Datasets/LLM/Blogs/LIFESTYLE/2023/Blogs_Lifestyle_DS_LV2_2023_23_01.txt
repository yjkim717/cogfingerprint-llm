### Finding My Party: More Than Just a Game

It’s funny how the quest for a new hobby can lead you to find a little piece of yourself. For me, in the strange, hybrid world of 2023, that quest led straight to the digital table of a Dungeons & Dragons game.

I’d always been curious about D&D. The stories of epic battles and intricate worlds were alluring, but as a complete beginner, the idea of diving in was intimidating. The rulebooks seemed like ancient tomes, and I worried my lack of experience would be a burden. But the desire to create, to tell a story with others, was a persistent little spark. So, I took a deep breath and posted online, looking for an LGBTQ+ friendly group. I offered what I had: flexibility, a willingness to learn, and a hopefully decent sense of humor.

The response was more than I could have scripted. I wasn’t just accepted into a campaign; I was welcomed into a collaboration. My first session was a blur of nervous excitement, but what stood out wasn’t my fumbled dice rolls—it was the laughter when my clumsy half-elf bard tried to negotiate with a surly dwarf, and the supportive “you’ve got this!” when I was unsure of a rule.

This experience has become a quiet anchor in my life. It’s a dedicated space each week where we collectively build something from pure imagination. We’re not just playing characters; we’re practicing empathy, teamwork, and spontaneous creativity. In a world that often feels disconnected, this online campaign has given me a genuine sense of community and connection. It turns out, the real treasure wasn’t the fictional gold we found, but the very real, unexpected joy of finding my people.
