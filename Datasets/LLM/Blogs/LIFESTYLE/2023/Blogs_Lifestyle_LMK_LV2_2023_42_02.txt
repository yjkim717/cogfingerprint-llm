"As I gear up to dive into the Skypea arc of One Piece, I'm hit with a wave of anxiety. Fellow fans have warned me about its slow pace and confusing plot twists. But I've always loved Eiichiro Oda's unique storytelling. Will I be disappointed or pleasantly surprised? As I sit here in 2023, surrounded by the trappings of my fandom, I'm reminded that sometimes the things that make us uncomfortable are the things that help us grow. I'm taking a deep breath and embracing the journey â€“ after all, that's what being a fan is all about."
