Losing my lavender rose last winter felt like a goodbye to a dear friend. That delicate purple bloom was my garden’s quiet highlight. Now, in 2023, I’m on a hopeful hunt for a new one—scouring local nurseries and online shops. It’s more than plant replacement; it’s about replanting a piece of joy and color back into my little sanctuary.
