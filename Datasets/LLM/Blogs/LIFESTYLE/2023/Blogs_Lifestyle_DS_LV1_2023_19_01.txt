It’s funny how life can feel like a DIY project sometimes. Last month, I tried patching old screw holes in my wall—quick fixes with a bit of mud, hoping to rehang a shelf without a fuss. But when I pressed down, the whole thing wobbled. It hit me: covering up old problems doesn’t make them solid. In 2023, I’m learning to rebuild from the studs, not just smooth over what’s weak. Some things are worth doing right.
