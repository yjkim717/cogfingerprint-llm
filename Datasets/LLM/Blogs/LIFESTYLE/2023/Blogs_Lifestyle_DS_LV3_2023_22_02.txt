Stepping into the world of sim racing in 2023, I felt a mix of excitement and intimidation when my new TLCM pedals arrived. The sheer number of spring customization options and iRacing settings was overwhelming. But instead of diving into complex pedal setups, I started simple. I focused on finding a beginner-friendly configuration that felt natural. It reminded me that in any new lifestyle pursuit, the goal isn't perfection from day one, but building a comfortable foundation. Sometimes, the best progress comes from just getting started and learning what works for you.
