## The Subtle Warfare of Urban Living

Living in a city these days feels…complicated. I stumbled across a Reddit poll the other day asking if people preferred a city of “fake nice” folks or one brimming with passive-aggression. It really hit a nerve. I've experienced both! The saccharine smiles that mask judgment, or the backhanded compliments that sting? Honestly, sometimes the quiet digs feel *slightly* less exhausting. Anyone else feel this strange tension in the urban air?
