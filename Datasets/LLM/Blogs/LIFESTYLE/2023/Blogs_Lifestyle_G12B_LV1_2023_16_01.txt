## My Brain's New Best Friends: ChatGPT, Rewrites, and the Quest for Lasting Knowledge

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with the same problem for years: I learn a ton, get really excited, and then… poof. Most of it vanishes into the ether within a few weeks. It’s incredibly frustrating, especially when you’re trying to level up in a field like computer engineering. I'm constantly absorbing new concepts, and the feeling of forgetting valuable information is a real motivation killer.

This year, I decided to try something different. I’ve been experimenting with a new study system, and I'm cautiously optimistic. It involves a surprising trio: ChatGPT, my own brainpower (through rewriting), and Anki, the spaced repetition software.

Here's the gist: I'll read about a concept – say, a specific algorithm – and then ask ChatGPT to explain it in simpler terms. I *don’t* just copy and paste. Instead, I use ChatGPT's explanation as a springboard to rewrite it *myself*, trying to really distill the core idea. Then, I create a flashcard in Anki, focusing on the key concepts.

The Anki part is the magic. The spaced repetition ensures I revisit these concepts at increasingly longer intervals, solidifying them in my long-term memory. It's felt surprisingly effective so far, and I'm hoping it’s the key to finally conquering the forgetting curve. 

It’s still early days, and I'm keen to see if this system truly holds up over time. Any thoughts from fellow knowledge-seekers out there? What are your go-to methods for preventing brain fade? Let me know!
