**The Lost Art of the Group Dinner**

I spent most of 2023 glued to a screen, my social life reduced to group chats and video calls. So, when it came time to plan our team’s annual dinner, I felt a real pressure to make it count. We needed a place for 25 people, somewhere with character near the convention center—a local gem, not some soulless chain.

Finding that perfect spot, a restaurant with a private room and a menu everyone could enjoy, felt like a mission. But the moment we were all seated, the real magic happened. The buzz of conversation, the clinking of glasses, the shared laughter over a great meal—it was a powerful reminder. In our digital world, the simple, profound act of breaking bread together is the connection we’re truly craving. It’s an experience no app can replicate.
