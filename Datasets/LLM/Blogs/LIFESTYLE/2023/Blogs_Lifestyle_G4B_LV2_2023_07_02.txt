**The Echoes in the File**

It’s funny how things from the past can keep echoing, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been thinking about the idea of “records” – not just digital ones, but the records of our lives. Like those old photo albums, filled with moments we thought were perfectly captured, yet sometimes feel a little…fuzzy around the edges. 

I was reading about a veteran recently, and it struck me how frustrating it is when the official versions of our stories don’t quite match up. A name discrepancy, a missing piece of paperwork – it’s like a fundamental truth about someone being obscured. 

It made me realize how important it is to actively piece together *our* narratives, to hold onto those details that feel vital. Because sometimes, the most important parts of who we are aren’t neatly filed away, but whispered in the echoes of our past.

Would you like me to tweak this or create a different version with a slightly different focus?
