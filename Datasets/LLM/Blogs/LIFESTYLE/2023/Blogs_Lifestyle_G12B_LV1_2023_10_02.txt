## The Shift: It Wasn't About Willpower, It Was About Seeing

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we build these narratives around ourselves. For years, I genuinely believed I could handle it. A drink here, a glass there – always in control. I’d watch friends struggle and think, "I'm different. I'm strong." 2023 feels like a lifetime away from that mindset.

The shift wasn't a sudden thing. It was a slow, creeping realization that my "control" was an illusion. The patterns, the justifications…they weren’t about strength, they were about something else entirely.  

Now, looking back, I see the toll it was taking - not just on my health, but on my relationships, my energy, my *life*.  It’s been a journey of redefining what strength *really* means – honesty, vulnerability, and choosing a life built on clarity, not clouded by something else. And honestly? It’s the best decision I’ve ever made.
