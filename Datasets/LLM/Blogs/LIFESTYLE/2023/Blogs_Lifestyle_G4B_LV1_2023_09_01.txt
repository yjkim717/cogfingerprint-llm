**Dreaming in Digital: Building Something with Friends**

There’s this quiet hum of excitement lately, a feeling of wanting to *create* something tangible, even if it lives entirely online. My friends and I are kicking around a crazy idea – a free online magazine! It feels a little daunting, like trying to capture a whole vibe in a digital space. 

We’re talking about articles, photography, maybe even some little illustrations, and we want it to look really good. That’s where the research is getting intense – specifically, figuring out the best layout software. Canva keeps popping up, which seems surprisingly user-friendly, but we’re also looking at PDF export options. It’s a surprisingly complex little project! 

It’s a reminder that sometimes the most rewarding things come from collaborating and trying to bring a shared vision to life.  2023 is proving to be a year of creative exploration, one pixel at a time.
