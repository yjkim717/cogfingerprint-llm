**Texas Dust and a Whole Lot of Worry**

Okay, deep breaths. I just got back from a week with the family in Texas, and honestly? It felt like a pressure cooker. You know how it is – everyone’s happy to see you, showering you with questions about nursing school, offering unsolicited advice about dating, and generally just…existing in a space that feels incredibly loud after a few days of quiet. 

This time, it was amplified by this weird, insistent anxiety that’s been clinging to me lately. It’s not a constant panic, more like a low-hum of ‘am I good enough?’ and ‘am I doing everything right?’ – especially when I’m surrounded by people who seem to have it all figured out. 

My family’s amazing, truly. But their warmth felt…suffocating. I crave solitude, a blank space to just *be*, and the constant chatter and questions were a painful reminder of that. There’s this guilt too, a nagging feeling that I’m somehow disappointing them, that I’m not appreciating their efforts. 

I realized something this week, though. It's okay to need space. It’s okay to admit that family gatherings, even with the people you love most, can be overwhelming. It’s a hard lesson to learn, especially when you're navigating the already challenging world of nursing school, but setting boundaries – even small ones – feels like a vital part of taking care of myself.  Right now, my priority is finding my center again.
