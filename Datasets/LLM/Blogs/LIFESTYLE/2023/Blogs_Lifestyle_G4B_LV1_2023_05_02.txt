**Saltwater Ghosts & Second Chances**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How the ocean just *remembers* you. I’d been gone for almost five years – a career change, a move, life just…happened. And then, last spring, I felt that pull again. The need to taste saltwater, to feel the sun on my face while battling a wave. 

I was a complete beginner again, a goofy, paddling-more-than-surfing novice. The first few sessions were humbling, to say the least. Watching experienced surfers carve perfect turns felt like watching a different language. But I realized I needed to focus on the basics – a smooth wave drop, efficient paddling, and honestly, a lot of recovery time! 

It’s been a slow, beautiful rebuild.  The ocean doesn’t care about your past; it just wants you to respect its power.  And maybe, just maybe, it’s teaching me a thing or two about starting over too. 2023 – back in the flow.
