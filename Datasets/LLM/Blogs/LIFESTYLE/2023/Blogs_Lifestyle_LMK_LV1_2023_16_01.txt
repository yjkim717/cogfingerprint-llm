As I sit here in 2023, surrounded by the latest gadgets and tools designed to make our lives easier, I'm reminded of the simple yet powerful study technique I've been using to supercharge my learning. I've been combining ChatGPT, the AI chatbot that's been making waves, with Anki, a flashcard app that's been a staple for many learners. The result? A potent spaced repetition strategy that's helping me retain information like never before.

Here's how it works: I use ChatGPT to generate concise, bite-sized notes on the topics I'm studying, and then import them into Anki, where I review them at increasingly longer intervals. It's been a game-changer for me, allowing me to absorb complex information without feeling overwhelmed. But I'm curious - is this a sustainable long-term strategy?
