## The Quiet After the Fizz

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we build these elaborate structures around things we think are essential. For years, my go-to structure for navigating anything remotely difficult was a bottle of wine. A stressful day? Wine. Feeling lonely? Wine. Even just… a Tuesday? Wine. It felt like a comforting ritual, a reliable friend. 

But the friend wasn’t really a friend, was it? It was a Band-Aid, masking feelings instead of actually processing them. And the structures it built? Walls, mostly. Walls between me and my actual emotions, between me and genuine connection.

This year, 2023, has been about dismantling those walls. It’s been about sobriety, and honestly, it’s been… quiet. Not in a bad way. It’s a quiet of introspection, of actually *hearing* what’s going on inside. 

There’s been a lot of discomfort, sure. Feelings I’d expertly buried for years have been surfacing. But alongside that discomfort has been this incredible sense of… clarity. I’ve started therapy, which has been a game-changer, and even a few minutes of daily meditation are making a difference. 

It's a journey, and some days are harder than others. But trading the temporary escape of alcohol for the ongoing work of self-discovery? It’s the best decision I’ve made in a long time. And the quiet? I’m learning to find peace within it.
