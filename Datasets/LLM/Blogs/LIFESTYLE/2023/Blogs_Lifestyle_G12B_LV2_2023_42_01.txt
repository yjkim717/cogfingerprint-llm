## The Unexpected Anxiety of White SUVs

It’s a weird thing, isn’t it? How a car can trigger a whole cascade of feelings. Lately, I’ve found myself holding my breath a little when a white Ford Explorer pulls up near me. I know, it sounds ridiculous. But there's something about their increasing prevalence, and that particular shade of white… it sparks a flicker of unexpected anxiety. 

I wonder if it's a subconscious thing, a residual echo of childhood games of "cop or not cop."  It’s a fleeting moment, gone as quickly as it arrives, but it’s made me think about how our brains latch onto visual cues and project meaning, often without us even realizing it.  Just another little quirk of navigating life in 2023, I suppose.
