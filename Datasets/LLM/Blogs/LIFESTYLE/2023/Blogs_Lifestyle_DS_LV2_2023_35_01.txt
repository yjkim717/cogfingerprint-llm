Every year, revisiting Hong Kong feels like catching up with an old friend. My little Smartone prepaid SIM is part of that ritual—a quick top-up, and my HK number springs back to life. It’s my tether, letting me receive SMS for MTR passes or a quick hello from a local friend. In our hyper-connected world, this simple ritual keeps one foot authentically in a city I adore.
