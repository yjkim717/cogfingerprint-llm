Sitting here with my Westin confirmation, I’m second-guessing everything. I crave a solo escape—not a party, just peace. I want to wake up to the ocean, spend afternoons lost in a book, and indulge in a spa treatment without a single itinerary.

Is a quiet, beachfront resort in Punta Cana with amazing food and serene pools too much to ask in 2023? My soul needs genuine relaxation, not just a vacation. I hope I booked the right place for that. Sometimes, the search for quiet is the loudest journey of all.
