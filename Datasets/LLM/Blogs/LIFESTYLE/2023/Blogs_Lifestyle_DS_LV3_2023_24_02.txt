When the Quest 2 arrived at my doorstep in early 2023, I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. I’d read all the hype—how VR was the future of gaming and social connection. For the first few days, I was mesmerized. Floating through space, painting in 3D, it was pure magic.

But then, the nausea set in. After just 20 minutes in a racing game, my stomach would churn, forcing me to rip the headset off. The initial thrill began to wear thin, replaced by a creeping disappointment. I realized most of the games felt like tech demos—fun for a moment, but lacking the depth to keep me coming back.

My Quest 2 now sits on a shelf, a sleek piece of hardware that feels more like a novelty than a revolutionary device. It taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, the most exciting innovations don’t always translate into lasting joy. For now, I’ve returned to my old gaming habits, a little wiser about the difference between hype and genuine enjoyment.
