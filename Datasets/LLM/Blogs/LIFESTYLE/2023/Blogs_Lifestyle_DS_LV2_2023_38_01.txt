It’s funny how life nudges you toward the right path sometimes. Last year, I was so fixated on planning every detail of my future—career, travel, even what books I’d read—that I forgot to actually live. Then, in early 2023, a sudden family trip forced me to drop the rigid itinerary and just go with the flow.

We ended up on a quiet beach at sunset, laughing over stories instead of checking items off a list. That unplanned evening taught me more about happiness than any five-year plan ever did. Now, I leave room for spontaneity. Life’s richest moments often arrive unannounced, and I don’t want to miss them because I was too busy scheduling.
