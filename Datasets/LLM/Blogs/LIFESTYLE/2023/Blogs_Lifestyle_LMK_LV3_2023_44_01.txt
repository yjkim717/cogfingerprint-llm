As I plan my 9-day solo trip for December 2023, I'm drawn to destinations that offer more than just a change of scenery. I'm craving a mix of warmth and wonder, with great food, stunning architecture, and breathtaking vistas. The USA has no shortage of amazing places to explore, from the sun-kissed cities of California to the snow-covered peaks of Colorado. As a solo traveler from the East Coast, safety is a top priority, but I'm also excited to step out of my comfort zone and immerse myself in new cultures. Whether I'm wandering through a vibrant city or taking in the natural beauty of a national park, I'm looking forward to expanding my perspectives and recharging my spirit. This solo adventure is a chance to rediscover myself and create lasting memories â€“ and I'm excited to see where the journey takes me.
