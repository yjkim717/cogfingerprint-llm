**The White SUV Effect**

Okay, so I’ve been noticing something lately – a really strange little anxiety that creeps up whenever a white Ford Explorer zooms past. It’s ridiculous, I know, but there’s just something about them that feels… intense. Maybe it’s the way they look, a bit like a police car, and it triggers this sudden awareness of road safety.
