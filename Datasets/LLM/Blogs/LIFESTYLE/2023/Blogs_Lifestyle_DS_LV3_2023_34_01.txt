Ever since diving into my backyard GoKart project this year, I’ve been wrestling with Fusion 360. Designing that suspension system felt like untangling headphones—constantly creating new planes for tubing, fighting the pipe tool, and losing track of my 3D model. It’s funny how a digital workspace can mirror life’s own workflow challenges: sometimes you have to step back, breathe, and trust the process. The struggle is real, but so is the satisfaction of finally seeing your vision take shape.
