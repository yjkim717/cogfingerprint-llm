**The Ghosts in the Vents**

There’s something deeply unsettling about living in an old house, isn’t there? It’s not just the creaks and groans – though those are definitely a factor! – but the little quirks that refuse to be ignored. Right now, my biggest battle is with a pair of ridiculously ornate wall vents. They’re beautiful, undeniably, a remnant of a bygone era. But they’re also stubbornly positioned, forcing me to constantly rearrange furniture just to create a clear line of sight. 

It’s a surprisingly frustrating exercise in compromise. I’m also starting to worry about the heating and cooling system – how did it ever work with these things in the way? It feels like they’re silently protesting the modern world.  

Honestly, dealing with these tiny, architectural annoyances is a surprisingly poignant reminder that we’re always negotiating with the past, trying to make it fit into our present lives.  Maybe that’s just part of the charm – and the challenge – of owning a piece of history.
