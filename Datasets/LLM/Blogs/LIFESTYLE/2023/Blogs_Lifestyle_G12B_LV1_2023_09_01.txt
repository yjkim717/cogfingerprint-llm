## The Unexpected Joy of Digital Scrapbooking (and My Magazine Dreams)

Okay, so I've been on a weird creative kick lately. It started with decluttering – seriously, Marie Kondo would be proud. But instead of just tossing things, I started *documenting* them. Old concert tickets, pressed flowers from a hike, even those silly receipts from that questionable late-night burrito run. 

I initially tried a traditional scrapbook, but space is at a premium in my tiny apartment. Then I stumbled down a rabbit hole of digital scrapbooking tools. It's surprisingly addictive! I'm using Canva mostly – it's so intuitive and has gorgeous templates. 

It got me thinking, though. Why not take this a step further? I’ve been toying with the idea of creating a little online magazine, a digital space showcasing the beauty in everyday moments. Something free, accessible, and maybe even offering downloadable PDFs for those who like a physical keepsake. It's a big dream, I know, but the idea of curating a collection of stories and visuals feels incredibly appealing. Anyone have recommendations for a good platform for that? Let me know!
