As I prep for my next Twitch stream, I'm torn between upgrading my mic game with the Shure SM7B and splurging on a Cloudlifter CL-1 to boost its signal. I've been eyeing the El Gato Wave 3, but its price tag is steep. I'm a casual streamer, not a pro, so I'm weighing the costs. Do I really need crystal-clear audio, or is my current setup good enough? For now, I'm sticking with what I know, but the SM7B's promise of studio-quality sound is tempting. Maybe it's time to level up my streaming setup.
