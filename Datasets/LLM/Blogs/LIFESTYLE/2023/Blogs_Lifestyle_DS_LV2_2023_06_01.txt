It’s 2023, and my Instant Pot and I are still figuring each other out. Tonight’s debate: should the chicken breasts ride high on the trivet or take a plunge into the broth? I used to think submerged meant more flavor, more tenderness. But lifting them above the liquid felt like a culinary gamble. The result? A surprisingly juicy revelation that has me rethinking all my kitchen "rules." Sometimes, the best things come from letting go, even in cooking.
