**Rooted in the Backyard**

It’s 2023, and honestly, I’ve been craving a little more *groundedness*. Scrolling through Instagram last week, I stumbled across this amazing idea: log growing mushrooms! Specifically, oysters and lions mane.  The thought of passively cultivating food in my suburban California backyard felt…right. 

I’m starting with sourcing the right logs – a real hunt, it seems! It’s a surprisingly meditative process, a little like tending to a tiny, silent ecosystem.  It’s not just about the mushrooms, though. It’s about slowing down and connecting with something ancient and natural.  Maybe that’s what I’ve been missing.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a different style of piece (e.g., more instructional)?
