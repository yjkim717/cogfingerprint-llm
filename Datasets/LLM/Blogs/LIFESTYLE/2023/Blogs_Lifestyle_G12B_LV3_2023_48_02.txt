## The KrisFlyer Conundrum: Premium Economy or Not? (And Should I Chase That Bonus?)

Okay, fellow travel lovers, I'm wrestling with a classic dilemma! December’s looming, and I’m dreaming of Tokyo – ramen, vibrant cityscapes, the whole shebang. The snag? Flights are pricey, naturally. I've got a stash of KrisFlyer miles, and I’m debating whether to splurge on Singapore Airlines Premium Economy for a one-way ticket from the West Coast versus sticking with regular Economy. 

ANA availability is proving tricky, which is a bummer. To add another layer of complexity, there's a potential Citi Premier 30% bonus floating around! Should I hold out for that, or just book the SQ Premium Economy now and savor the extra legroom? Decisions, decisions! Anyone else ever faced this award travel quandary? Let me know your thoughts - I could really use the wisdom of the crowd!
