There’s a certain magic in traveling alone—especially when you intentionally choose a place that doesn’t do all-inclusive chaos. Last year, I booked a quiet beachfront resort in Punta Cana, and it was exactly what my soul needed. Mornings began with peaceful runs along palm-lined paths, followed by lazy afternoons at the spa. I lingered over meals at the on-site restaurant, savoring both the flavors and the solitude. It reminded me that sometimes the richest experiences come not from having everything included, but from curating exactly what you need. A gentle lesson in living intentionally.
