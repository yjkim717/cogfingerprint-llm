## The Pursuit of Scent & Simple Swaps

Isn't it funny how a fragrance can feel like a tiny luxury, a little mood boost in a chaotic world? Lately, I've been obsessed with chasing that feeling. My Creed Aventus and MFK Aqua Celestia are getting a *lot* of wear. Itâ€™s sparked a desire to explore, but also a realization: I have too much! So, I'm diving into the fragrance swap community. Trading scents feels so much more sustainable and exciting than endless buying. Anyone else finding joy in simple swaps these days?
