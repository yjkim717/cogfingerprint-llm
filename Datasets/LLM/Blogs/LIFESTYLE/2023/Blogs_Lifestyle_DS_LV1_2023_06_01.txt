It’s funny how a simple kitchen debate can mirror life’s bigger questions. Just last week, I stood over my Instant Pot, wondering: trivet or submerged for these chicken breasts? One promises gentle steam, the other a thorough soak. It struck me—aren’t we all just trying to find the right balance between pressure and support in our own lives? In 2023, with everything moving so fast, maybe the secret to staying tender is knowing when to rise above it all, and when to dive right in.
