## The Hype vs. Reality of "Disruptor" Brands

Anyone else feeling a little…underwhelmed by the direct-to-consumer revolution lately? I’ve been trying out a few of these “startup” brands promising to disrupt everything from socks to skincare, and honestly, the results have been mixed.

Recently, I took a gamble on Bliss Club tights. The marketing was *so* good – sleek, minimalist, and promising a perfect fit. Plus, the price point was higher than your average drugstore option, so I figured, "Okay, it *must* be worth it."

Turns out, not really. The panty line was shockingly visible. For the price, I could have bought three pairs from Decathlon and been happier. It got me thinking – are we sometimes paying for the *idea* of a brand more than the actual product? It's a tricky balance, and I'm definitely rethinking my impulse buys. Anyone else experiencing this?
