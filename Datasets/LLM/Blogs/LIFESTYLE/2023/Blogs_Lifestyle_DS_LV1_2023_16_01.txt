### My 2023 Study Game-Changer Was a Little Bit Human, a Little Bit Robot

I’ll admit it: for years, I treated studying like a sprint. I’d cram the night before an exam, pour everything onto the page, and then promptly forget 90% of it. It felt efficient, but last semester, my computer engineering courses caught up with me. The concepts were too complex to simply memorize and discard.

So, in 2023, I decided to change my entire approach. I committed to the long game with spaced repetition using Anki flashcards. But creating hundreds of good questions was a slog—until I partnered with an AI.

Now, my weekly ritual looks like this: I feed my handwritten notes from lectures into ChatGPT and ask it to generate potential exam questions. It’s like having a study buddy who never gets tired. I then load the best questions into Anki, and the app’s algorithm tells me exactly when to review them.

It’s not a magic bullet—it still requires discipline. But for the first time, I’m not just studying to pass a test. I’m building knowledge that actually sticks, thanks to a clever blend of old-school note-taking and futuristic assistance. My brain (and my GPA) are thanking me.
