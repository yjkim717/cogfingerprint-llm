>## The Unexpected Joy of Digital Archaeology

It's funny how passions shift. For years, I was chasing the latest graphics card, optimizing for peak performance in the newest games. Now, 2023 finds me equally obsessed… but with a completely different kind of digital pursuit. I’ve finally pulled the trigger on a new PC – a solid £1000 build – and it's not for blasting through AAA titles. 

Instead, I'm diving deep into emulator development, tinkering with machine learning to improve image fidelity, and even dabbling in some Unreal Engine scripting. It’s a strange blend of game dev, programming, and a kind of digital archaeology, resurrecting old systems and pushing them into the future. It’s surprisingly rewarding, and a lot less stressful than chasing leaderboard scores!
