>## The Algorithm and My Grandma's Apple Pie

It struck me the other day watching a football game – how drastically things change. Someone was musing about whether legends like Joe Namath could grasp today's X's and O's. And it made me think about *everything*. 

My grandma, bless her heart, still makes apple pie from a recipe she learned in the 1950s. It's incredible, truly. But would she understand the nuances of sourdough starters or the obsession with perfectly laminated dough? Probably not! 

It’s comforting, though, isn't it? That some things – a good pie, a classic game, genuine connection – transcend trends. Maybe clinging to those things, even when the world shifts, isn't resistance, but a beautiful kind of grounding.
