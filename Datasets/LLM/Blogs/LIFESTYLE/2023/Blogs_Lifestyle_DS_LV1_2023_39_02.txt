You know that rush when you get a job offer on the spot? I felt like I’d won the lottery when Chipotle hired me right after the interview. But then, silence. No onboarding details, no follow-up—just radio static. It’s 2023, and clear communication should be a given, right? That experience taught me a lesson: in life and work, promises need action to mean anything. Now, I prioritize transparency in all my relationships, because nobody should have to guess where they stand.
