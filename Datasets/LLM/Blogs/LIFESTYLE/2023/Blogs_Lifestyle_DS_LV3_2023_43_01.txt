It’s funny how much of life in 2023 feels like a data visualization project. I’ve been trying to make sense of my own habits lately—mapping out my weekly routines like a bar chart, seeing which activities get the most "screen time." Then there are my social connections, a sprawling network diagram of friends, colleagues, and fleeting online interactions.

But the most telling chart? The word cloud generated from my journal. "Anxious," "hopeful," and "tired" loom large, surrounded by smaller, quieter words like "peace" and "progress." It’s a raw, unfiltered library of my inner world. Just like a developer piecing together the right React components, I’m learning to build a clearer picture of myself, one chart at a time. It’s not about perfect data, but about understanding the story it tells.
