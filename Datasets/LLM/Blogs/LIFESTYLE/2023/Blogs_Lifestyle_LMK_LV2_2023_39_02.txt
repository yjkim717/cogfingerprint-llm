"Still Waiting to Hear Back". I landed my dream job at Chipotle on the spot, but the excitement quickly turned to confusion. Weeks went by, and I hadn't received a single email about onboarding. A follow-up call with my hiring manager broke the silence, but the paperwork still hasn't arrived. As I wait, I'm reminded that even in 2023, the hiring process can be a wild ride. Has anyone else experienced this frustrating limbo? I'm learning to be patient, but it's hard not to wonder what's next.
