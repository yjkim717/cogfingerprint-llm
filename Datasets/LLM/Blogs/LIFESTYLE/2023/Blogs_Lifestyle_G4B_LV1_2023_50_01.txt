**The Algorithm and My Desk Job**

It’s weird, isn’t it? I’ve spent the last decade selling… well, selling *things*. It’s a good job, steady, and I’m decent at it. But lately, this nagging feeling’s been growing – a worry about the future. I keep reading about AI, about how JavaScript and Python are suddenly *everything*, and honestly, it’s a little terrifying. 

I’m seriously considering a career shift.  I’ve always been curious about coding, about building things with logic.  But the thought of my skillset – honed in sales – becoming obsolete because of an algorithm feels… unsettling.  It’s not about hating technology; it’s about recognizing that the world is shifting, and maybe, just maybe, I need to shift with it.  Anyone else feeling this tension in 2023?
