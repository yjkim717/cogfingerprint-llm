It’s 2023, and my suburban backyard is becoming a sanctuary—not just for me, but for mushrooms. I’ve been diving into the log cultivation method, dreaming of homegrown oyster and lion’s mane varieties. But first, I need logs. It’s funny how this search connects me to the land in a new way, turning ordinary walks into treasure hunts for fallen branches. Sometimes, the simplest quests remind us that growth, in life and fungi, starts with just showing up and paying attention.
