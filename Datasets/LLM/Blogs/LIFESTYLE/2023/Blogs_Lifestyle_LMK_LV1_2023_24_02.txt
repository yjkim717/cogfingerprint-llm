"I've always been fascinated by the idea of immersing myself in a virtual world, so when I finally got my hands on a Quest 2 VR headset in 2023, I was stoked. I envisioned hours of seamless gaming and exploring new dimensions. But, boy, was I in for a disappointment. As soon as I strapped on the Oculus and started playing, I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. The graphics were stunning, I'll give it that, but the experience was marred by queasiness and a general feeling of disorientation. To make matters worse, I found the available games to be somewhat lacking in depth and engagement. I tried a few different titles, but none of them really held my attention for long. All in all, my Quest 2 experience has been a letdown. Maybe I'm just not cut out for virtual reality gaming?"
