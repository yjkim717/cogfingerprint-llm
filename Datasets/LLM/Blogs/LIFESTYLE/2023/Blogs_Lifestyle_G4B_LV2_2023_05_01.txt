**The Quiet Joy of Growing My Own Magic**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2023, with everything feeling so…fast, I’ve found a surprising amount of peace in a simple project: growing mushrooms. Specifically, oyster and lions mane on logs right in my suburban California yard. 

I’m wrestling with the perfect log – it’s a surprisingly weighty decision! It feels a little wild, this slow, deliberate process of nurturing life from wood. It’s a reminder that beauty and abundance can be found in quiet persistence, a welcome contrast to the digital noise of daily life.  Anyone else finding grounding in unexpected hobbies?
