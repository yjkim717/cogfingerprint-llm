**The Tokyo Dream & the Flight Dilemma**

There’s something about planning a December trip to Tokyo that just feels…significant, doesn’t it? I’m wrestling with a classic travel dilemma right now: SQ Premium Economy versus ANA for my upcoming adventure.  I’m chasing a Citi rewards bonus, of course, but honestly, it’s more about the *experience*. 

ANA has been tricky to snag availability – a frustrating reminder that the best things often require a little extra effort.  I’m picturing myself in that Premium Economy seat on Singapore Airlines, a little extra space and comfort as I finally soak in the vibrant energy of Tokyo.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, a splurge on travel is an investment in a truly memorable moment.
