**Dreaming in Texture: When a Small Space Needs a Big Idea**

There’s something incredibly satisfying about transforming a little corner of your home. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with the idea of injecting personality into unexpected places – and my friend just finished a guest bathroom that completely stole my heart.
