### The Unplanned Detour That Changed My Year

It’s funny how the best things in life often arrive unannounced. My 2023 was meticulously planned: a color-coded spreadsheet, ambitious career goals, a strict fitness routine. I was going to *crush* it. Then, in March, a persistent ache in my wrist turned into a diagnosis of tendonitis, forcing me to step away from my keyboard—my primary tool for work and connection.

For the first two weeks, I was a mess. I felt disconnected and useless. My carefully constructed plan was in ruins. Out of sheer boredom, I started taking long walks without a podcast in my ears, just listening to the neighborhood. I noticed the subtle shift from winter’s bare branches to the first brave buds of spring. I started reading actual paper books again, feeling the weight of the pages.

This forced slowdown wasn't a derailment; it was a recalibration. I rediscovered the quiet joy of observation, the peace of an unhurried morning. I connected more deeply with my partner over board games instead of scrolling through our phones side-by-side.

My wrist eventually healed, but the lesson stuck. 2023 didn’t turn out as I’d planned, and I’m so grateful for that. It taught me that sometimes, the most productive thing you can do for your lifestyle is to simply step off the track you’re so determined to stay on. The view from the detour can be breathtaking.
