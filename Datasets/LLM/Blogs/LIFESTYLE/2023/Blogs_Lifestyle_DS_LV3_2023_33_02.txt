I still find myself searching online for that documentary I saw as a child—the one following a young woman entering a cloistered Catholic convent. In 2023, with life moving at a dizzying pace, I often think about that story of quiet devotion. It’s amazing how a single film from childhood can plant a seed of reflection that grows with you through the years.
