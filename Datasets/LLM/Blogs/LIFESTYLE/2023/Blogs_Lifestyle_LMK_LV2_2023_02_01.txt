"Embracing the Chaos: Our Journey as a Multilingual Family"

As I sit here surrounded by the chaos of homework, language learning apps, and flashcards, I'm reminded of the beautiful mess that is our multilingual household. My trilingual kids are growing up, and with them, our language-related challenges. The other day, I received a message from a fellow parent seeking advice on how to navigate the complexities of raising trilingual children. How do you help with homework when it's in a language you're not fluent in? How do you make math practice fun when it's in a third language? And, the million-dollar question: should we introduce a fourth language? As I reflected on our own experiences, I realized that the OPOL (One Parent, One Language) approach has been a game-changer. But it's not just about the approach; it's about embracing the chaos and finding joy in the journey. In this blog, I'll share our story and some practical tips on raising multilingual kids in 2023.
