There’s something quietly empowering about claiming a week and a half for yourself. Last year, with nine vacation days burning a hole in my pocket and a deep craving for warmth, I decided to go it alone. No coordinating schedules, no compromising on sights—just me, my curiosity, and a plane ticket to somewhere sunny.

I’ve always been drawn to architecture—the way a city’s soul is etched in stone and steel. Wandering solo through sun-drenched plazas and winding old quarters, I wasn’t just a tourist; I was a participant in the silence and the space. I climbed bell towers for panoramic vistas, ate lunch on museum steps, and let myself get happily lost.

That trip was more than a vacation; it was a reminder that solitude isn’t lonely. It’s clarity. In 2023, we’re so constantly connected that disconnecting—on your own terms—feels like the ultimate luxury. And honestly? I’m already dreaming of my next solo escape.
