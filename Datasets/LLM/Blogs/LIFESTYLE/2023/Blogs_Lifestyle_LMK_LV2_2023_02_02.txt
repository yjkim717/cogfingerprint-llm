"As I hit the icy waves this winter, I realized my bodyboarding game was being held back by the cold. I was searching for the perfect gloves to keep my grip intact. After trying out a few, I found the ideal pair that not only kept my hands warm but also gave me the grip I needed to ride the waves with confidence. If you're a fellow winter bodyboarder, I'd love to share my top picks with you."
