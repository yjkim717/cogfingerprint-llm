"As I plan my family's 2023 Delhi trip, I'm reminded that travel is about more than just sightseeing - it's about creating memories. With a budget of $300 per night, we're looking for a hotel that feels like home. Delhi's metro makes navigation easy, and hiring a driver gives us the freedom to explore. We're seeking a cozy, affordable haven that suits our family's style. Have you had a similar experience? What made your Delhi trip special?"
