It’s funny—I’ve been thinking about how much I rely on AI these days, like GPT-4, to help with everything from coding to planning my week. But it’s a lot like trying to declutter my closet: there’s only so much you can hold in your head (or its "context window") before things get messy.

I realized that maybe, just like simplifying my space, I need to focus on what truly matters. Less noise, more clarity. In 2023, it’s not about doing more with tech, but doing better with less. And honestly? That feels like a breath of fresh air.
