**Texas Dust and a Whole Lot of Guilt**

Okay, real talk. I just got back from a week with the family in Texas, and I’m…processing. It’s funny how “home” can feel so utterly *not* home sometimes. This year, it felt particularly heavy. 

Nursing school is demanding, relentlessly so. I’m constantly battling anxiety, feeling like I’m perpetually falling behind, and letting myself down. And then, add in being around my family – a whirlwind of well-meaning questions about my future, comparisons to my cousins’ seemingly perfect lives, and a constant pressure to be…happy. 

Honestly, it felt like a pressure cooker. I desperately craved quiet, a space where I could just *be*, without feeling like I needed to perform or explain. The guilt was immense. Guilt for wanting to escape, guilt for not being ‘grateful’ for their support, guilt for feeling like I was disappointing everyone. 

There’s something about returning to your roots that just strips you bare, doesn't there? It highlights the cracks and the anxieties you’re trying so hard to cover up.  

I spent a lot of time just staring out the window, watching the dust swirl across the fields, and reminding myself that it’s okay to need space. It’s okay to prioritize my own mental health, even if it means saying “no” sometimes.  Right now, my peaceful return home isn’t about escaping, it's about recharging – so I can actually *do* this nursing thing, and do it with a little less guilt and a lot more self-compassion.

Would you like me to tweak anything about this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
