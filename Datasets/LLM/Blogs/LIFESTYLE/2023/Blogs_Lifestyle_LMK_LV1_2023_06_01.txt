"As I stood in my kitchen, pondering the perfect Instant Pot method for tender chicken breasts, I realized it's not just about the cooking technique - it's about the lifestyle. Do I trudge through a messy cleanup from submerging the chicken in liquid, or opt for the trivet method, preserving the breast's delicate texture? In 2023, with our busy lives, we crave simplicity. For me, using a trivet wins, as it yields juicy results with minimal fuss, freeing me to focus on what truly matters - savoring the meal and the moments that follow."
