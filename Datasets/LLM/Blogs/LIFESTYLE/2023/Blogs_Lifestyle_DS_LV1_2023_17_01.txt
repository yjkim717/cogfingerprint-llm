### The Unplanned Detours: What My Parents Taught Me About Travel

It was supposed to be the most efficient week of my life. I had it all mapped out: a colour-coded spreadsheet for our family trip to Japan, with the Osaka Amazing Pass calculated to the yen and every Kyoto temple timed for the perfect golden-hour photo. My inner project manager was thrilled. My parents, however, had other plans.

Our first "detour" happened in Denden Town, Osaka’s electric hub. While I was mentally rushing us toward the next train, my dad became utterly fascinated by a wall of vintage transistor radios. For twenty minutes, he and a shopkeeper, with no common language, bonded over capacitors and dials. I watched, my schedule anxiety melting away, replaced by a simple, profound joy in his curiosity.

Later, after the controlled chaos of Universal Japan, we found ourselves at the Fushimi Inari shrine. Instead of powering up the torii-gate path, my mom insisted on sitting at a quiet bench halfway up, simply watching the world go by. We spent an hour there, not ticking off a landmark, but sharing stories and sipping green tea. The relentless pursuit of "what's next" finally quieted.

I went to Japan in 2023 to show my parents a amazing time, armed with passes and itineraries. But they ended up showing me something far more valuable: that the heart of travel isn't in the destinations you check off, but in the unplanned moments you collect. The budget was perfect, the sights were stunning, but the real luxury was learning to slow down and see the world—and my parents—through a new, less-rushed lens. Sometimes, the best itinerary is the one you're willing to abandon.
