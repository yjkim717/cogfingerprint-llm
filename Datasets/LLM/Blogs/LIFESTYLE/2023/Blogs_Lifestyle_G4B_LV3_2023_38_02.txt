**The Weight of Winter (and Shipping!)**

Anyone else feel like 2023 is just *filled* with logistics? I recently wrestled with a surprisingly complicated problem: getting a huge box of winter coats and scarves shipped across the country to my sister. It wasn't just about the clothes, though. It was about the cost – those shipping fees really add up! 

It made me think about how much we pack into our lives, both physically and emotionally. Sending those bulky winter clothes felt like sending a little piece of home.  And realizing the hidden costs of moving things around, even across a few states, is a good reminder to prioritize what truly matters – and maybe consolidate my wardrobe a bit!
