**The Ghosts in My Documents**

There’s a strange feeling, isn’t there, when you realize something fundamental about yourself isn’t quite…right? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a frustrating, almost unsettling puzzle – a mismatch in my records. It’s a small thing, really, a name discrepancy here, a missing detail there, but it’s unearthed a deeper worry about the accuracy of my own history. 

It reminded me of what a veteran is going through, struggling with VA records and the echoes of past service. Suddenly, I started thinking about how easily our narratives can get fragmented, lost in the shuffle of time and bureaucracy.  

It's a gentle reminder that our personal histories aren’t always perfectly preserved.  Maybe it's about taking a moment to actively piece together the fragments – to gently question, to seek clarification, and to ensure that the story we tell ourselves, and the story others tell *about* us, is as complete and honest as possible.  It’s a surprisingly powerful act of self-care, really.
