There’s something uniquely humbling about technology that’s supposed to simplify life but ends up teaching you lessons in patience instead. Take my recent late-night battles with an OPNsense VM on Proxmox—what began as a sleek, virtualized firewall solution quickly turned into a recurring nightmare. Every few days, like clockwork, the system would freeze up, leaving my home network in disarray.

Digging into logs, I kept hitting the same wall: arpresolve errors and mysterious passthrough NIC failures. Each crash felt like a personal defeat, a reminder that even in 2023, with all our advancements, some problems demand old-school troubleshooting and a deep breath. But you know what? Wrestling with those issues taught me to appreciate stability—and the small victories when things finally work. Sometimes, the most frustrating tech tangles leave you a little wiser, and a lot more grateful for the quiet moments when everything just… runs.
