**Unexpected Comfort in a Bottle**

Okay, you guys, I need to share something a little random that’s been brightening my 2023. I stumbled across this flavored whiskey – and honestly, the initial smell was *weird*. Like, aggressively cookie dough. I almost put it back, but something made me try it. 

And wow. It’s genuinely delicious. It’s not trying to be something it’s not; it’s just a really smooth, subtly sweet whiskey with that unexpected, comforting doughy note. It’s become my go-to for a little evening sip – a proper sipping snack, really – and I’ve even been experimenting with it as a mixer for small gatherings. 

It just reminds me that sometimes the best discoveries are the ones that completely surprise you.  Finding a little bit of unexpected sweetness in a bottle? That's a good feeling, right?  What small joys have you found lately?
