### The Engine in My Life

It’s funny how life can feel like a sputtering engine sometimes.

I was trying to get my old scooter running right this past weekend—a classic case of misfiring at full throttle. I’d replaced everything I could think of, just like I do when I hit a wall in my own life. New spark plug? That’s like buying a new planner. Adjusted the valves? That’s my version of a strict new morning routine.

But the problem persisted. A jarring *pop* every time I gave it everything I had. It made me think: isn't that just 2023 in a nutshell? We’re all pushing the throttle wide open, trying to get back to pre-pandemic speed, but something deep inside is misfiring. We’ve done all the surface-level fixes, but the real issue is more fundamental.

Maybe, like my scooter, we’re hitting a personal rev limiter. Not a failure, but a built-in safeguard saying, "This is your limit *for now*." The answer isn't to force it. It’s to stop, listen to the pops and sputters, and understand what they’re trying to tell us. Sometimes the most powerful move is to simply ease off the throttle and just coast for a while. The road will still be there when we’re ready.
