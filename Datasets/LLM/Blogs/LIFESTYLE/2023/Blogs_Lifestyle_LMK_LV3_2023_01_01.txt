"As I declutter my fragrance collection, I'm reminded that sometimes, it's about the thrill of the trade. I'm swapping my 2016 Creed Royal Mayfair for a new scent, embracing the world of niche perfumes and luxury fragrances. It's a refreshing way to revitalize my senses and discover new favorites in 2023."
