It’s funny how we stick with certain habits—the same coffee order, the same route to work—because they feel safe. I’ve been thinking lately about how that comfort extends beyond our personal lives into things like politics. In 2023, with so much noise and division, it’s easy to just stick with what we know, even when it might not be serving us anymore.

I remember chatting with a neighbor who’s always supported the same party. He spoke about corruption and his own frustrations, yet change felt too uncertain. It reminded me of staying in a job long after it’s drained you, just because the alternative seems risky.

But what if we paused and asked ourselves: Does this still align with my values? Are my concerns being heard? Sometimes, stepping back and embracing moderation—listening, reflecting, and being open to something new—can bring unexpected clarity. It’s not about abandoning principles, but about growing through them.

Real change, whether in our daily routines or our communities, starts with that quiet, honest conversation with ourselves. And who knows? The other side might just hold the progress we’ve been hoping for.
