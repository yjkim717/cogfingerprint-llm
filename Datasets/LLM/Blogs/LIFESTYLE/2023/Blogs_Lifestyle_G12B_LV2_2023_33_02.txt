## The Quiet Pull of "Maybe"

I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day asking about a documentary – a young woman choosing cloistered life as a nun, likely seen on the Catholic Channel years ago. It got me thinking. We're so bombarded with "yes" choices these days – yes to the next job, the next purchase, the next adventure. But what about the quiet pull of “maybe”?

That flicker of curiosity towards a life radically different, a life of dedicated silence and prayer… it’s surprisingly compelling. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most profound answers aren't shouted, but whispered, felt deep within. Maybe it's not *for* me, but appreciating the courage to say "yes" to a path less travelled is something we can all learn from.
