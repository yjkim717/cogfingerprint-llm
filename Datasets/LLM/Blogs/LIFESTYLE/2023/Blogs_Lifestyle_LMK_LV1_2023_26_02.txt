As I stared at my permed hair in the mirror this morning, I couldn't help but feel frustrated. Despite using curl care products like Shea Moisture curl cream, my locks still looked frizzy and straight. I was determined to find a solution. After some trial and error, I've learned that it's not just about the products, but also about embracing a curl-friendly lifestyle. By adjusting my routine and being more gentle with my hair, I've finally started to see the definition and bounce I was missing. It's been a journey, but it's 2023 - it's time to rock those gorgeous curls!
