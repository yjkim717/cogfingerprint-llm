**The Panic of the Forgotten Facts (and How AI Might Actually Help)**

Okay, let’s be real – as a final year student in 2023, the pressure is *intense*. You’re drowning in readings, assignments, and the constant, nagging fear that you’re going to forget everything the second you step away from your desk. I’ve definitely been there.

Recently, I was chatting with a friend who was completely freaking out about remembering all the biochemical pathways for her upcoming exam. She’d been trying to brute-force it – endless rereading, highlighting, the whole nine yards – and still felt like it was all slipping away. 

Then she started experimenting with ChatGPT and Anki, pairing the AI with spaced repetition flashcards. It’s… surprisingly effective. ChatGPT helped her break down complex concepts into smaller, more digestible chunks, and Anki uses that spacing to gently remind her of the information at increasing intervals. 

It’s not a magic bullet, of course. But it’s shifted my perspective. Instead of just *absorbing* information, I’m actively engaging with it, reinforcing it over time. It's a little less frantic, a little more… mindful. 

Anyone else finding ways to combat the dreaded "knowledge fade"? Let me know in the comments!

Do you want me to tweak this draft – perhaps add a specific example, adjust the tone, or focus on a particular aspect?
