>## The Quiet Joy of a December Escape

It's December, and the usual holiday hustle is starting to bubble. But this year, I felt a different pull – a quiet yearning for something…still. Something just for *me*. You know that feeling, right? The one where you need to recharge, to reset, to wander without an itinerary dictated by anyone else?

So, I'm planning a solo trip. Five days, East Coast, December chill in the air. It's not about ticking off tourist traps; it's about soaking in the atmosphere. I'm envisioning grand architecture – those stoic, beautiful buildings that whisper stories of decades past. Maybe Boston’s brownstones, or Philadelphia’s historic squares. 

Honestly, the idea of wandering through a new city, camera in hand, completely self-directed, feels incredibly liberating.  There's a specific kind of peace in knowing you can change your plans on a whim, grab a coffee at a random cafe, and simply *be*. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best adventures are the ones we design for ourselves. And in 2023, with the world feeling so chaotic, that feels pretty vital. Any East Coast city recommendations for a solo architecture enthusiast? Let me know!
