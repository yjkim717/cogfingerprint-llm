**The Algorithm and My Gut: Should I Really Change Careers?**

Okay, let’s be real – 2023 feels like a year of big questions, doesn’t it? I’ve been staring at my laptop screen a lot lately, wrestling with a thought that’s been simmering for weeks: should I actually change careers? 

I’m a sales professional, comfortable and, frankly, good at what I do. But the pull towards programming – specifically React and JavaScript – is getting stronger. It’s exciting, creative, and feels… *right*. 

But then the headlines hit. AI is automating everything, right? Will a robot ever be better at coding than me? It’s a valid fear. It’s easy to get caught up in the anxiety of the future. 

Honestly, I’m trying to balance the logical, data-driven part of my brain with that little voice in my gut – the one that whispers about passion and growth. It's a weird mix of excitement and a healthy dose of "what if?".  Anyone else feeling this pull towards a big shift, even with the looming shadow of AI?
