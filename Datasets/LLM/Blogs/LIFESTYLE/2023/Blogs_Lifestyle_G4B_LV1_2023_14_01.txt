**Finding the Right Vibe: Group Dinners in 2023**

Let’s be honest, coordinating group dinners in 2023 feels like a small logistical battlefield. Last month, my friend group of twenty-five needed a spot near the convention center – a *big* challenge! We finally landed on a place with a fantastic private room and seriously delicious local cuisine. 

It reminded me that sometimes, the best memories aren't made in fancy restaurants, but around shared laughter and good food.  Plus, figuring out the Uber/taxi situation for everyone was half the fun! It’s a reminder to prioritize connection over perfection, and to embrace the slightly chaotic joy of bringing people together.
