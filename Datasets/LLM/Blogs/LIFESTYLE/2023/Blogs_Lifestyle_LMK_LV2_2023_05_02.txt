"Getting Back on the Board: My Surfing Journey"

I still remember the stoke of catching my first wave. As a kid, surfing was a big part of my life, but life had other plans, and I hung up my board for years. Now, I'm itching to get back out there. The problem is, I'm rusty. Really rusty. Dropping in on waves feels like a distant memory, and I'm struggling to find my rhythm. To make matters worse, the spots I used to surf are now crowded with beginners like my younger self. I'm having to relearn how to read the waves and find beginner-friendly breaks. If you're a fellow returning surfer, I'd love to hear from you - how did you get back into it? Or, if you're just starting out, what tips do you have for an old-timer like me? Let's ride the waves together!
