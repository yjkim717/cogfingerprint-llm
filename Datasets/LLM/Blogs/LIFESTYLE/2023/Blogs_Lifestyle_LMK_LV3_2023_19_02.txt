As I stood in my cluttered workshop in 2023, staring at two 1x12 boards, I realized that assembling them into an L shape wasn't just about woodworking - it was about precision and patience. I turned to my trusty Kreg 520, wondering which direction to drill those pocket holes. It was a DIY moment that made me appreciate the beauty of slowing down and getting it right, one carefully crafted joint at a time.
