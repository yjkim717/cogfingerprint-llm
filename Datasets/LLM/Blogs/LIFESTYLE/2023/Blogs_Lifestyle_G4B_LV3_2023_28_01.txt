**The Mystery of the Missing Spark**

There’s something strangely satisfying about troubleshooting, isn’t there? Recently, I was staring at a circuit board, trying to figure out why a DC motor driver just…stopped. A weird capacitance reading and some faded markings were all I had to go on. It felt a bit like a puzzle, a tiny, frustrating mystery.  Sometimes, identifying a single, silent component – a diode, maybe a zener – reveals a bigger picture about how things work, and how easily they can fail. 2023 is teaching me patience, one circuit at a time.
