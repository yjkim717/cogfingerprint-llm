The email from Kyiv sat in my inbox for a week. A major construction project needed my consultation. Pre-2022, I’d have booked my flight without a second thought. Now, the "what-ifs" swirled with the logistics. My colleagues assured me the city center was stable, but news alerts told a different, distant story. It’s a strange new calculus for a job I love—weighing professional duty against the primal pull of safety. This conflict has rewired our sense of normal, turning a simple site visit into a profound personal decision.
