's response:## The Unexpected Hum of Homesickness

It's funny, isn't it, how the smallest things can trigger the biggest waves of emotion? This week, my family’s experiencing a perfect storm of that, and it all started with a guitar. My son, Liam, has been living and working in Berlin for the past six months, pursuing his music, and absolutely thriving. We're incredibly proud – he's found a vibrant community, writing incredible songs, and building a life for himself across the Atlantic. 

He’s got a show coming up, a real showcase of his talent at a cool little venue. He was so excited, practicing relentlessly, finally feeling like he was really *landing* in Berlin. Then came the frantic phone call yesterday. Apparently, a shipping mix-up – a TSA case, as he put it, involving an overseas visit and a misplaced label – resulted in his beloved guitar being accidentally shipped back to our house in Ohio. 

The sheer panic in his voice! It wasn’t just about the guitar itself, though it’s a beautiful instrument, a gift from his grandfather. It was about the disruption to his routine, the feeling of being pulled back, even momentarily, to a life he's deliberately chosen to leave behind. 

It’s made me incredibly reflective. Seeing him wrestle with this unexpected setback, so far from home, has highlighted the sacrifices he’s made and the incredible strength he’s demonstrating. It’s a sharp reminder that building a life, anywhere, isn’t always smooth sailing. There will be bumps, unexpected detours, and the occasional guitar shipped across the ocean. And that, I realize, is perfectly okay. It’s part of the journey, and it’s making him, and us, appreciate the connections that span continents all the more. Now, to figure out how to get that guitar back to Berlin!
