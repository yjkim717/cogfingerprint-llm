## The Flooring Dilemma and the Future of "Home"

Okay, so I've been wrestling with a home improvement question lately – can you really install carpet *over* vinyl? Seems odd, right? I'm prepping to sell, and really want to keep that existing vinyl looking good. Apparently, Empire Carpet is a name coming up a lot in this conversation. It’s a reminder that even small decisions about our homes feel tied to bigger plans, like future moves and new beginnings. Anyone else feel that?
