**The Ghost in the Machine: When Tech Just *Feels* Wrong**

Anyone else ever feel like your carefully built systems are… fighting you? I’ve been wrestling with a frustrating issue lately – my OPNsense firewall, a VM on Proxmox, has been acting strangely. It’s intermittent, a little ghost in the machine, suddenly unresponsive with DNS errors popping up. 

It’s a surprisingly stressful experience, especially when you’re relying on it for remote security. It made me think about how much we invest in these digital tools, and how easily they can throw a wrench in our carefully planned routines.  

This whole thing has highlighted the importance of not just *having* a robust network, but actively understanding it.  It’s a reminder that technology, for all its power, isn’t always intuitive.  Sometimes, it just needs a little patience – and maybe a fresh cup of coffee – to get back on track.
