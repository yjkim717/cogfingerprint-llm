As I reflect on a recent therapy session, I'm reminded of the fragility and beauty of human existence. Discussing meaning and self-worth with a suicidal client left me seeking guidance on how to navigate such delicate conversations. In 2023, where mental health is increasingly prioritized, I'm learning that it's okay to ask for help. By sharing our struggles and vulnerabilities, we can create a ripple effect of compassion and understanding.
