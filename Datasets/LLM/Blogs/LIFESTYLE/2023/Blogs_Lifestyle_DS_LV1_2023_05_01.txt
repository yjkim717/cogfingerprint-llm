It’s 2023, and my suburban backyard has become a quiet experiment in self-sufficiency. Inspired by local growers, I decided to try the log method for oysters and lion’s mane mushrooms. Sourcing logs here in California wasn’t easy—it took some creative networking with tree-trimming neighbors! But now, watching those first delicate mushrooms emerge feels like a small miracle. It’s more than a hobby; it’s a gentle rebellion against the disconnect of modern life, a tangible way to slow down and nurture something real, right outside my door.
