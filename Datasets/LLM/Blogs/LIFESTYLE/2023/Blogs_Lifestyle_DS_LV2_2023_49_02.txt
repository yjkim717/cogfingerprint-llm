The email from my Polish friend hit my inbox with a familiar weight. "Is Kyiv safe for a site visit?" he asked, his concern palpable through the screen. Itâ€™s 2023, and such questions have become our new normal. It made me reflect on how our definitions of "routine" and "risk" have been completely rewritten. We now weigh construction blueprints against security briefings, a stark reminder that the backdrop of our daily lives and work has irrevocably changed, forcing a deeper, more conscious calculation into every plan we make.
