"Fast food hiring in 2023 is a wild ride! I just had the craziest experience - I interviewed at Chipotle and was offered the job on the spot. I was stoked, but now it's been a few days and I still haven't received an onboarding email. I even followed up with a call, and... crickets. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever get the paperwork sorted. Guess I'll just have to wait and see if they make me an honorary crew member without the official paperwork. Fingers crossed I don't get ghosted!"
