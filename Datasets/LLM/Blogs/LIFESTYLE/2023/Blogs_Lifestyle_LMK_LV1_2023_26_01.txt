The digital manga obsession - a guilty pleasure many of us can't shake off. As someone who's spent countless hours scouring the web for the latest manga updates, I recently found myself at odds with Cloudflare's security measures while trying to automate the process using Puppeteer. The infamous Access Denied Error 1020 was a major roadblock. It's funny how a simple task like webscraping can become an ordeal. But it got me thinking - is this obsession with staying up-to-date really worth the frustration? In 2023, with so many other ways to consume content, I'm starting to reevaluate my priorities. Perhaps it's time to take a step back and find a healthier balance between my online and offline life. After all, there's a whole world out there beyond the screen, waiting to be explored.
