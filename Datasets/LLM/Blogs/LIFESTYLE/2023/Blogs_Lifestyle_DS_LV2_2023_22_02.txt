It’s funny how a simple box of T-LCM pedals can turn your living room into a cockpit of dreams. As I unboxed them in late 2023, I wasn’t just setting up hardware—I was tuning a part of my daily escape. Tweaking springs and software felt like calibrating patience and focus, a small ritual in my otherwise hectic life. In sim racing, as in life, the right setup makes all the difference. It’s not just about speed; it’s about finding your flow, one careful adjustment at a time.
