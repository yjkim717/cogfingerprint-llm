It’s funny how 2023 has become the year of digital clutter for me. Between endless notifications and overflowing photo albums, I felt buried in data about my own life. So, I decided to get creative. I made a word cloud from my most-used phrases in texts—turns out “coffee” and “one sec” feature heavily. A bar chart of my weekly screen time was a brutal, colorful wake-up call.

Visualizing my habits didn’t just organize the noise; it held up a mirror. It made me ask: am I living intentionally, or just generating data? Sometimes, you need a chart to see the story you’re actually telling.
