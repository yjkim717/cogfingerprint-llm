It’s funny how digital clutter mirrors life. Last year, I filled my Xbox Series S with emulators in dev mode, chasing nostalgia. But soon, the hard drive groaned under the weight. Formatting it felt like a fresh start—a clean slate, not just for the console, but for me. In 2023, I’m learning that letting go of digital baggage can make room for what truly matters: presence over pixels.
