As I celebrate another year of sobriety, I'm reminded of the profound impact it's had on my life. Being part of a community of fellow 'sobernauts' has been a game-changer. We've shared our stories, supported each other through the tough times, and marveled at the positive changes that have taken place within us. For me, sobriety has been a journey of self-discovery, revealing new perspectives and attitudes that I never knew I had. My drinking habits were once a crutch, but now I've found healthier ways to cope with stress and emotions. I'm curious - how has sobriety or a change in drinking habits affected you? Have your attitudes and perspectives shifted in unexpected ways? Let's keep the conversation going and explore the many facets of recovery together in 2023.
