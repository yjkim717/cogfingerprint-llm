It’s funny how a guest bathroom became my latest obsession. Those textured walls, with their subtle knockdown finish, felt like a blank canvas just begging for personality. I’ve always been drawn to bold, fearless design, so why not here? Lately, I’ve been dreaming of an Alice in Wonderland mural—something whimsical and a little surreal to greet our visitors. In 2023, our homes are our sanctuaries, and infusing them with stories feels more important than ever. Maybe it’s time to embrace the unexpected and turn the ordinary into a small, magical adventure.
