## Letting Go, and the Promise of Renewal

It’s a strange feeling, isn’t it? That quiet anxiety that settles in when things feel uncertain. This year, with everything happening in Turkey – the elections, the political shifts – I’ve been thinking a lot about acceptance. Specifically, accepting outcomes we didn’t necessarily want.

It's easy to cling to what we know, to the familiar comfort of a certain political landscape. But maybe, just maybe, a shift, even a loss, can be an opportunity. A chance for reflection, for restructuring. Perhaps even for addressing some of the things we’ve wished were different for a long time. 

And honestly, the idea of a coalition – different voices working together – offers a glimmer of hope for a fresh perspective. It’s a reminder that change isn't always a bad thing; sometimes, it’s a chance to rebuild, stronger than before.
