>## The Unseen Weight of Practice

It's strange, isn't it, how we rehearse things we desperately hope *won't* happen? I was reading about a photographer documenting the impact of lockdown drills on kids – a stark reminder of the anxieties we're subtly layering onto young lives in 2023. 

It got me thinking about my own "drills." The constant pressure to optimize, to hustle, to be *productive*. We're practicing a future of relentless achievement, and I wonder, what's the cost? Are we so busy preparing for the worst, we’re missing the quiet beauty of just *being*? Maybe a little less practice, and a little more presence, is what we all need.
