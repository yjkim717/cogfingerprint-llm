Last summer, my five-year-old and I gathered sea glass along the shore, their small hands clutching these little treasures. With just some glue and a few old jars, we transformed them into suncatchers. It wasn’t about perfection, but the shared joy of creating. We even sold a few at our little plant stand. In 2023’s rush, that simplicity—turning nature’s cast-offs into something beautiful together—was the lifestyle reset we truly needed.
