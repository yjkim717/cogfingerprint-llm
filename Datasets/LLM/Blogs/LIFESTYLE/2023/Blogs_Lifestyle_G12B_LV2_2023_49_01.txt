## Letting Go of the "Shoulds": Finding Peace in the Pivot

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we get attached to a plan. I spent a good chunk of 2023 feeling…rigid. Like I was clinging to a vision of what my life *should* look like, a roadmap meticulously drawn and constantly consulted. It involved a certain career trajectory, a specific savings goal, even a particular aesthetic for my apartment.

And then, life, as it so often does, gently (or not so gently) nudged me off course. A project fell through. A financial shift happened. Suddenly, that roadmap felt less like a guide and more like a constraint.

The initial reaction was…discomfort. A sense of failure, even. I kept thinking, “But I was *doing* everything right!”  But the more I resisted, the more anxious I felt.

Then, slowly, something shifted. I started to realize that holding onto that rigid plan was preventing me from seeing the opportunities unfolding *around* me. It was like refusing to acknowledge a beautiful sunset because it wasn't part of the itinerary.

It's a lesson about embracing the unexpected, about recognizing that "change" isn’t always a negative. Sometimes, it’s a chance to re-evaluate, to pivot, to discover something even better than what we initially envisioned.  It’s about accepting that relinquishing a cherished plan can actually open doors we never knew existed. And honestly, that feels pretty good.  What "shoulds" are you ready to let go of?
