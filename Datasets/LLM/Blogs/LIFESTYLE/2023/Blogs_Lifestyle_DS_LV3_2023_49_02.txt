It’s 2023, and my friend in Poland just asked me about Kyiv. He’s got a construction gig there, but his main question was simple: Is it safe to visit? I paused, thinking of the city’s resilience amid conflict. Yes, there’s risk—ongoing tensions, the hum of construction rebuilding what was lost. But there’s also life, courage, and a powerful sense of purpose. Sometimes, the most meaningful journeys aren’t about escaping risk, but stepping into a story bigger than ourselves. Would you go?
