>## The Great Used Car Quest of '23

Okay, so adulting is hitting differently these days, right? Suddenly, you're not just thinking about yourself. We're a family of four now, and our trusty old sedan just isn't cutting it. We’re diving into the used car market – a surprisingly stressful experience! 

Right now, we're circling around a few contenders: a Ford Edge, a Hyundai Santa Fe, and a Kia Sorento. All seem solid choices, but the research is *real*. Safety ratings, reliability, space for the kids and all their gear…it’s a lot! Wish us luck in finding the perfect, pre-loved ride for our next chapter. Any recommendations?
