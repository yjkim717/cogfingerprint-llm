## The Instant Pot Didn't Lie (About My Patience)

Okay, confession time. Remember all those promises of Instant Pot magic? Well, this week, mine staged a full-blown dumpling rebellion. I was aiming for cozy chicken and dumplings, and ended up withâ€¦ well, chicken soup with tiny, disintegrated dumpling ghosts. 2023 has taught me that even kitchen gadgets have their limits, and sometimes, a little failure is just a reminder to slow down and enjoy the process. Anyone else had an Instant Pot mishap?
