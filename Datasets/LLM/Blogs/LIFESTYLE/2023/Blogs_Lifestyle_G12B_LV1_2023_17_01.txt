## The Unexpected Joy of Slow Travel (and Planning with My Parents!)

Okay, so I'm officially knee-deep in travel planning. Not just any travel planning, mind you. This is *family* travel planning. My parents are coming to visit, and we're tackling a big one: Osaka and Kyoto in Japan.

It sounds incredibly exciting, right? And it is! But it’s also… a lot.  I've always been a “go, go, go” traveler. Pack everything in, see every landmark, conquer every museum. But planning this trip with my parents has really thrown a wrench in that approach. Suddenly, “conquering” feels a lot less appealing than “enjoying.”

They're not exactly up for sprinting through temples or power-walking across Osaka.  We’re talking about a comfortable pace, time for tea, and maybe even a little people-watching. And honestly? I’m finding I *like* it.

We've been debating the Japan Amazing Pass – it seems like a smart move for transportation, but we need to crunch the numbers to see if it's truly worth it. I'm also picturing them absolutely mesmerized by Fushimi Inari Shrine, those thousands of vibrant red torii gates winding up the mountain.  It’s a classic for a reason!

This whole process has made me realize something: travel isn’t always about ticking boxes. It’s about connection. Connecting with a new place, sure, but also connecting with the people you’re sharing the experience with. And sometimes, slowing down – planning the details, adjusting expectations, prioritizing comfort – is the best way to foster that connection.

It's a shift in my travel philosophy, and one I'm surprisingly looking forward to.  Wish us luck navigating the trains and the crowds! I’ll keep you posted on our adventures (and hopefully, our budget!).
