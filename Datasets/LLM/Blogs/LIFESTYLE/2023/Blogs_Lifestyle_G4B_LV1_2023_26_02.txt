**My Perm’s Mid-Life Crisis (and Why I’m Embracing the Waves)**

Okay, real talk: my perm is having a moment. It started out gorgeous – bouncy, wavy curls – but lately, it's been stubbornly frizzy after drying. I’ve been battling with Shea Moisture products, trying to coax back that original shine. Honestly, it’s made me think about letting go of things that don’t truly serve me. Maybe my hair is gently whispering, "Hey, you're beautiful just *being* wavy!" 2023 is all about embracing the natural, right? Time to chill and let my hair do its thing.
