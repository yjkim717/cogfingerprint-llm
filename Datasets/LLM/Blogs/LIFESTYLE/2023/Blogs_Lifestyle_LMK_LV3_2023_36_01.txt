As I fumbled to access my Wyze cam, I realized I'd forgotten to enter my 2-factor authentication code. Panic set in until I remembered I could add a secondary TOTP authentication method. Problem solved! This experience got me thinking - in today's connected world, security and convenience often clash. I've come to appreciate the peace of mind that comes with having multiple authentication options. It's a small win, but one that makes a big difference in my daily life, and I'm grateful for the flexibility it brings in 2023.
