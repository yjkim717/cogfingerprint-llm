## The Glitch in My Plan (and Why It's Kind of Exciting)

Okay, so here's the thing. For years, I’ve been happily juggling two worlds: video editing and web development. Both freelance, both creative, both… a little disconnected, honestly. I’m good at them, sure, but I always felt like I was splitting my focus. 

Then I started tinkering – automating video tasks with little scripts, building simple web tools to organize projects. Suddenly, a blurry intersection started to appear. It's fascinating, this space where video editing meets programming, where I can leverage my coding skills to *really* streamline my video workflow.

It’s making me question everything. Should I lean into this? Is there a career path here I haven’t even considered? I’m reaching out to folks who are already navigating this world – any insights are welcome! 2023 feels like the year to embrace the glitch and see where it leads. Wish me luck!
