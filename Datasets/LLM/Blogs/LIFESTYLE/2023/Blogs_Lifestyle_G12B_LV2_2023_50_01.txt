Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational style, set in 2023.  I've focused on the lifestyle aspect triggered by the career change question, rather than the technical details.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: The Unexpected Weight of a New Dream**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple question – "Is programming still a good career choice in the age of AI?" – can unravel a whole tangle of anxieties. I saw it pop up in a forum the other day, someone transitioning from sales, wrestling with the future. And it got me thinking.

I’ve been coding for nearly a decade now, and 2023 feels… different. Not necessarily *scarier*, but definitely more complex. It’s not just about mastering frameworks like React anymore; it's about adapting to a landscape where AI is rapidly reshaping the rules.

But beyond the technical stuff, what struck me was the sheer *weight* of pursuing a new dream. That initial rush of excitement – the late nights fueled by coffee, the thrill of building something – it’s powerful. But it also demands a sacrifice. Time with family, hobbies, even just quiet evenings reading a book.

This career change, this pursuit of something new… it’s not just about lines of code. It's about redefining your life, and accepting the responsibility that comes with it. It's a journey, a constant recalibration, and honestly? It’s a little exhausting, but undeniably worth it.
