>## The Quiet Luxury of Disconnecting (and Maybe Skipping All-Inclusive)

This year, I’ve been craving something different. Not the whirlwind adventure, not the bustling city break, but… stillness. A serious dose of *relaxation*. I started dreaming of Punta Cana, picturing turquoise water and white sand, but then I realized the usual all-inclusive resorts felt… overwhelming. Too much activity, too many people, too much *stuff*.

Instead, I’m leaning towards a quieter kind of luxury. A beautiful resort, like the Westin Punta Cana maybe, but opting out of the all-inclusive package. Just picture it: waking up, strolling to the beach, a blissful spa treatment, a delicious meal at a thoughtfully curated restaurant. Paying for what I *actually* want, when I want it.

It feels like a rebellion against the constant pressure to maximize every moment. A conscious choice to prioritize peace and quiet, and to savor the simple pleasures. Maybe it's just me, but in 2023, disconnecting feels more valuable than ever. And sometimes, the most luxurious thing you can do is simply *be*.



Hope you like it!
