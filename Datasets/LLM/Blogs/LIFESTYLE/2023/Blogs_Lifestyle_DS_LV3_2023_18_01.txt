The glow of my laptop screen illuminates my face as my niece’s laughter fills my quiet apartment. She’s over a thousand miles away, showing me a wobbly crayon drawing. In 2023, this is our new normal.

Living far from my siblings and their growing families used to feel like a constant ache, a series of milestones witnessed through photos instead of in person. I missed the casual Sunday dinners, the impromptu hugs, the day-to-day noise that makes a family feel whole. But distance has a funny way of fueling creativity.

We’ve started a virtual book club, my sister and I, reading the same chapter each week before our video chat. We’ve cooked the same recipe simultaneously, our kitchens connected by a screen, sharing the triumphs and kitchen disasters. These intentional, shared experiences have become our lifelines. They’re not a perfect replacement for being there, but they’ve woven a new kind of closeness—one built not on proximity, but on purpose. The miles still separate us, but our connections have never felt stronger.
