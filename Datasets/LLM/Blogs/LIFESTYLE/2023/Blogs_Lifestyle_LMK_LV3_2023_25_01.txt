The Condom Conspiracy That Backfired. In a moment of mischief, I poked holes in a condom, hoping to surprise my husband with a baby. But, little did I know, our marriage was about to get a lot more interesting. The unexpected twist? He had been considering vasectomy! Our attempt at family planning turned into a hilarious misadventure. It was a wake-up call to communicate openly about our desires and contraception. Now, we laugh about it, and our relationship is stronger. It's a reminder that humor and honesty can be the best contraception against relationship issues.
