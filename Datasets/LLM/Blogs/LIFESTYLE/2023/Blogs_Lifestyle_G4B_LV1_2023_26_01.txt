**The Unexpected Frustration of Digital Hunting**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something meant to be a little enjoyable can suddenly feel like a massive headache. Lately, I’ve been trying to build a little project – essentially, web scraping a manga website using Puppeteer. Sounds cool, right?  

But I keep running into this infuriating “Access Denied” error, specifically a Cloudflare thing. It’s like the website is deliberately throwing up a wall. It’s made me realize how much we rely on seamless digital experiences, and how easily those can break. 

It’s a small frustration, sure, but it’s a reminder to appreciate the quiet moments, the things that don’t require battling digital gatekeepers. Maybe I’ll just stick to browsing for now – less stressful, definitely!
