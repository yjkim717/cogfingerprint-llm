## Beyond Beige: Injecting Personality into Small Spaces

Okay, so I'm diving into a little home refresh project – our guest bathroom! It’s tiny, but I want it to feel *special*. The walls already have that textured knockdown finish (a bit of a 90s throwback, let’s be honest!), and I'm determined to elevate it beyond a simple coat of paint. I'm dreaming of a playful mural, maybe a whimsical mushroom scene inspired by my mom’s gorgeous nature photography. It feels like a perfect way to add character and a personal touch – proof that even a small space can be a vibrant reflection of who you are.
