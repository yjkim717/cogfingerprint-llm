"Self-Publishing Our Vision: A Journey with Canva. In 2023, my friends and I decided to launch a free online magazine, sharing our passions and interests with the world. We needed a platform that was user-friendly and allowed us to bring our vision to life. We discovered Canva, a layout software that made designing a breeze. With its intuitive features, like connected text boxes, we crafted a magazine that flowed seamlessly. Plus, we could download our work as a PDF, making it easy to share. Canva has been a game-changer for our little project, empowering us to self-publish with ease and creativity."
