There’s something meditative about woodworking—the scent of fresh-cut pine, the hum of the Kreg 520 in my hands. Last week, I puzzled over pocket hole direction on 1x12 boards, wondering if it was about strength or just aesthetics. It struck me how often in life we focus on how things look instead of how they’re built. In 2023, maybe the real strength lies in the hidden foundations we create, not just the visible seams.
