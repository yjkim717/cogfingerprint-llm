>## The Unexpected Beauty of Impermanence (and Drywall)

Okay, so, full confession: I’ve been wrestling with drywall. Not in a metaphorical, “life is falling apart” kind of way, though honestly, it felt a little like that at times. I actually moved some outlets in my living room. A seemingly small project that quickly devolved into a lesson about… well, everything.

Turns out, drywall doesn't forgive shifting plans. Those old screw holes? They stared back at me, mocking my initial enthusiasm. Then came the mudding – a surprisingly meditative, if messy, process. 

It's struck me, though, how this whole experience mirrors life. We build things, meticulously planned, then life throws a curveball, and we have to adjust, patch, and rebuild. Impermanence isn’t a disaster; it’s just… the process. And sometimes, the patched-up, slightly imperfect result is even more beautiful than the original plan. 2023 has been a year of a lot of patching, and I'm starting to appreciate the texture of it all.
