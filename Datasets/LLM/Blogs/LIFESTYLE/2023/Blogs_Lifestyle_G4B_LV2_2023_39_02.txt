**The Waiting Game (and Chipotle Dreams)**

Anyone else feel that knot of anticipation when you *finally* land an interview? I was totally there last month, chatting with a hiring manager at Chipotle – a long-held dream job, honestly. Then… silence. No confirmation email, no “we’ll be in touch.” It’s a weird mix of excitement and anxiety, right? 

It reminded me that sometimes, the best laid plans have a little pause.  I’m learning that patience, and a well-timed follow-up email, can actually make a difference.  Anyone else been through this lately? Share your experiences! #jobsearch #waitinggame #chipotle

Do you want me to tweak this or explore a different angle?
