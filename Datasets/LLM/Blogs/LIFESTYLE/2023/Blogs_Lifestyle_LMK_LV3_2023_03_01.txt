The thrill of unboxing a new M2 MacBook Air in 2023 was short-lived when I discovered I couldn't run Stellaris, my go-to Paradox game. Initial research suggested it was compatible, but reality had other plans. As a gamer and a Mac enthusiast, this compatibility issue was frustrating. It made me realize that even with cutting-edge tech, glitches can occur. Now, I'm exploring alternatives to enjoy gaming on my Mac. It's a reminder that sometimes, embracing the unknown can lead to new discoveries and a more flexible lifestyle.
