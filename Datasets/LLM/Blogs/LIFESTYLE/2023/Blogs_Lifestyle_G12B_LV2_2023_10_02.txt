>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and suitable for a 2023 audience.  I've tried to capture the essence of the summary while expanding on it with relatable details.  I've included a suggested title.  After the post, I've added some notes on why I made certain choices.

**The Day "Just One" Lost Its Appeal**

Remember that feeling? The one where a glass of wine at the end of a long day felt like a reward, a necessity even? For years, that’s how it was for me. It wasn't about needing it, not really, but wanting it. A little something to unwind, to quiet the noise. 

Then, somewhere around mid-2023, something shifted. It wasn't a dramatic epiphany, but a slow realization. The thought of that first sip started to feel... heavy. The anticipated relaxation didn't materialize; instead, a flicker of something else – a quiet resistance.

I started noticing how much mental energy I spent *thinking* about drinking, planning for it, justifying it. And the joy? It was fading.  The desire to drink hadn't vanished, but the *wanting* had definitely changed. It was less a comfort and more an obligation I was suddenly questioning. 

It's a strange space, this place between wanting and not wanting. And honestly, it's incredibly freeing to just acknowledge it. I'm not preaching sobriety, but I'm curious – have others felt this shift in perspective? What did it feel like for you?

**Notes on Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Remember that feeling?" and "It wasn't about needing it, not really" to create a more personal connection.
*   **Storytelling:** I focused on a specific, relatable scenario (the end-of-day glass of wine) to anchor the reflection.
*   **2023 Context:**  Mentioning "mid-2023" grounds the piece in the current year.
*   **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with a question encourages engagement and invites readers to share their own experiences (aligning with the "sobernauts" concept).
*   **Avoidance of Preaching:** I intentionally avoided making it a lecture about quitting drinking. The focus is on the *shift in perspective*.
*   **Possible Expansion:** Could be expanded by talking about what replaced the desire to drink, or deeper exploration of the "quiet resistance."
