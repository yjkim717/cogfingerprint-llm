As I watched my nephew assemble his first GoKart, I realized that the thrill of creation isn't just about the end result - it's about the journey. In 2023, we're spoiled for choice with tools like Fusion 360, but even with its powerful features like the pipe tool, designing a suspension system can be daunting. It's a reminder that sometimes, slowing down and embracing the process is the best way to truly enjoy the ride.
