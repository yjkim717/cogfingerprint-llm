## Kyiv on My Mind (and a Bit of Worry)

The email landed this morning – a potential project, a really exciting one, in Kyiv. My heart leaped, then a little knot of worry tightened in my stomach. Construction work is my passion, but Kyiv… well, 2023 has painted a stark picture.

I’m a Warsaw resident now, and the news feels closer than ever. It’s easy to become numb to the headlines, to compartmentalize. But this feels different. This isn’t just reading about it; it's a possibility of being *there*. 

My friends here reassure me, pointing to the resilience of the Ukrainian people and the ongoing efforts to protect civilian areas. Still, the thought of navigating a city under such circumstances… it’s a lot to process. I need to weigh the professional opportunity against the very real concerns for personal safety. It’s a tricky balance, and honestly, I'm still trying to figure it out.
