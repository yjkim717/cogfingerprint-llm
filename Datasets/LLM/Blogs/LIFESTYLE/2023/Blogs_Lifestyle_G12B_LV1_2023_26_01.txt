## The Scroll and the Struggle: Patience in a Hyper-Fast World

It’s funny the things that can trigger a moment of reflection these days. I was wrestling with a coding project last week – trying to scrape images from a manga site using Puppeteer. Sounds technical, I know, but the problem was Cloudflare kept throwing a "1020 Access Denied" error at me. Apparently, the site dynamically loads images as you scroll, and Cloudflare wasn’t a fan of my automated attempts.

It was frustrating. I wanted instant results, the images *now*. But the process made me think about life outside of code. We live in a world that demands instant gratification. Streaming, instant delivery, endless scrolling… it’s all designed to keep us perpetually wanting more, *now*.

But sometimes, the best things – a truly meaningful connection, a skill you've honed, a beautiful piece of art – take time to load, just like those images. It's about accepting the delay, the loading screen, and trusting that the result will be worth the wait. A little patience, even in 2023, still goes a long way.
