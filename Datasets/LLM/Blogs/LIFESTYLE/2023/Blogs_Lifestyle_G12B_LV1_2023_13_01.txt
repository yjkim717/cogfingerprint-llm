## The Unexpected Cost of Wellness

It's 2023, and I'm chasing that elusive "wellness" glow. I was eyeing an Oura Ring – the sleep tracking seemed promising! But then the sticker shock hit. Seeing the price in USD and then factoring in Australian shipping? Ouch. It’s a good reminder that even optimizing your health has a cost, and sometimes, a surprisingly hefty one. Maybe a good night's sleep is best achieved with a little less screen time and a lot more calm.
