The luxury dilemma: is SQ premium economy worth the splurge? As I pondered my next Japan trip, I found myself torn between booking a standard ticket or taking the Kris Miles plunge. The price difference was steep - a whopping 32,500 miles one-way from the West Coast to Tokyo. ANA's premium economy was tempting, but I was willing to pay the premium for SQ's signature service. As I weighed my options, I realized that sometimes, it's not just about the destination, but the journey. Is the extra comfort worth the miles? That's a decision only a fellow travel enthusiast can understand.
