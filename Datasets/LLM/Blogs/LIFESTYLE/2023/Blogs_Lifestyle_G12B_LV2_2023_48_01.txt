## The Unexpected Joy of Simplifying Travel

Remember when family trips felt like a meticulously planned military operation? Flights, itineraries, endless lists… I was definitely that person. This year, though, something shifted. We recently returned from a whirlwind three days in Delhi – Red Fort, Jama Masjid, the whole shebang – and it was… *easy*.

We ditched the fancy hotel dreams and found a perfectly lovely, budget-friendly spot. Honestly, it freed us up. Less time stressing about amenities meant *more* time laughing with the kids, wandering through bustling markets, and soaking in the city's vibrant energy. 

It’s a quiet realization, but I’m starting to think the best travel memories aren't forged in five-star luxury. They're born from those spontaneous moments, those little detours, and the shared joy of simply *being* together. Maybe simplifying is the real adventure.
