As I ponder a career shift from sales to programming at 24, one question lingers: will AI advancements render my newfound skills obsolete? With React and other frameworks constantly evolving, it's natural to wonder if I'll be replaced by automation. But, as I dive deeper into the world of coding, I've come to realize that programming is not just about writing code - it's about problem-solving, creativity, and human connection. While AI may automate routine tasks, it can't replicate the empathy and understanding that a human developer brings to a project. By learning to code, I'm not just acquiring a new skill, I'm gaining a new perspective and a chance to shape the future. As I embark on this journey, I'm excited to explore the intersection of technology and humanity, and to discover where my skills can make a meaningful impact.
