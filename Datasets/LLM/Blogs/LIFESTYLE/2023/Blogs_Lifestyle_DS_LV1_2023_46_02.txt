**The Little Things That Aren't**

It’s funny how a tiny detail can unravel a whole story. Last week, I was convinced I’d snagged a bargain—a pristine Mitutoyo digital micrometer from an eBay seller. As a hobbyist woodworker, precision is my new obsession. But when it arrived, something was off. The data port, a feature I was excited to use, had two fewer pins than the one in the official product photos.

That missing pair of pins felt like a metaphor. In 2023, we’re all chasing efficiency and the best deal, often trusting a thumbnail image and a five-star rating. This little discrepancy made me pause my project and reflect. It wasn’t just about a potential counterfeit tool; it was about the authenticity of my own pursuits. Was I building things with care, or just rushing to check a box?

Sometimes, the universe sends a sign through a missing pin. For me, it was a reminder to slow down and appreciate the genuine craftsmanship, both in the tools I use and the life I’m building. The real measurement of success isn't always in the millimeters, but in the intention behind the work.
