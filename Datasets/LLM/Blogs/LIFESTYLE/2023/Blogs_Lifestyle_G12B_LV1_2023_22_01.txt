## The Art of the Shared Adventure (and a Little Bit of Planning)

Okay, so planning a Disney trip for one family is already a *thing*. But two? With coordinating schedules, preferences, and the ever-present Genie+ system? Let’s just say it felt a bit like orchestrating a symphony of small humans. 

We just got back from a week at Walt Disney World with my sister's family, and the biggest takeaway wasn't the amazing rides (though those were great!). It was the realization that shared experiences, especially with loved ones, require a little extra forethought. 

Trying to snag those Lightning Lane passes for everyone to ride together felt surprisingly symbolic of life, really. You need to be proactive, flexible, and sometimes, you have to adjust your expectations. We didn’t get *everything* we wanted, but the laughter, the shared moments, and the memories made were worth every strategic reservation and a few missed opportunities. It’s a reminder that the journey, even with a little logistical chaos, is what truly matters.
