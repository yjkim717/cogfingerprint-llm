There’s a special kind of irony in 2023: my sleek new M2 MacBook can edit videos like a dream, but it balks at loading my favorite space strategy game, Stellaris. It crashes right at 80%, a digital sigh before giving up. I bought this machine for a creative, fluid lifestyle, yet here I am, nostalgically missing the clunky, dedicated gaming PC of my past. It’s a funny reminder that even the shiniest tools have their limits, and sometimes, simplicity is the real luxury.
