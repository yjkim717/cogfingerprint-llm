**The Endless Scroll & the Missed Edit**

It’s weird, isn’t it? This year, I’ve been wrestling with feeling like a giant, endless scroll – constantly reacting, adding little things to my life, my projects, my routines. Like GPT-4 trying to tweak my existing schedule. I’m trying to build a better workflow, but my “context window” – my ability to really *understand* where I’m going – keeps getting squeezed. 

I realized I’m adding features without truly integrating them, just patching things up. It’s exhausting. Maybe I need to step back, acknowledge the whole system, and actually plan a meaningful edit, instead of just a quick fix.

Do you want me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps generate a different version with a slightly altered focus?
