**The Moment My Drone Vanished (and Why It Felt Like a Disaster)**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2023 has been a year of embracing new hobbies, and I jumped headfirst into drone flying. It seemed so cool, so cinematic – until it wasn’t. Last week, my DJI Mini 3 Pro decided to have a very unwelcome rendezvous with a towering oak tree. 

The initial thrill quickly morphed into a full-blown panic. I frantically scanned the branches, battling a rising tide of frustration. It’s a surprisingly humbling experience to realize just how reliant you become on a small piece of technology. 

The recovery process was…messy. After a surprisingly long and awkward climb, and a healthy dose of “please don’t break it,” I managed to retrieve my drone. Scratches and a slightly dented propeller aside, it was thankfully salvageable. 

It wasn’t just about the drone, though. It was about the feeling of losing control, the sudden anxiety of a hobby gone wrong.  It reminded me that even the most exciting new passions come with a learning curve – and sometimes, a little bit of a fall.
