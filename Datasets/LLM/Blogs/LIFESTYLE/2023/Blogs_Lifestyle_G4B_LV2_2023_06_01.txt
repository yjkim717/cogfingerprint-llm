**Instant Pot Chicken Conundrums**

Okay, real talk – I’ve been wrestling with a tiny, persistent kitchen dilemma. It’s about my Instant Pot, and specifically, how to cook chicken breasts. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over whether to use a trivet and let them steam, or actually *submerge* them in liquid. 

It sounds silly, I know! But there’s something deeply satisfying about a perfectly tender, juicy chicken, and I just want the *right* method.  This year, I'm trying to be more intentional about my cooking – slowing down and really considering the process.  Maybe the answer isn’t about speed, but about truly understanding how the heat works.  Anyone else have a kitchen obsession?
