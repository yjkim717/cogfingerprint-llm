There’s something sacred about traveling alone—especially when you’re craving quiet. Last year, I booked a solo trip to Punta Cana, dreaming of pure seclusion: mornings by the spa, afternoons on a peaceful beachfront, and dinners where the only company was the sound of waves. I wanted a place where I could truly exhale. Was the Westin Punta Cana the answer? For a soul in need of gentle restoration, it just might be.
