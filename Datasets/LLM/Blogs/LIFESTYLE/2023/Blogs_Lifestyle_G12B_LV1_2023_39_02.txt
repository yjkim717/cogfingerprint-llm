>## The Waiting Game & the Unexpected Lesson

Okay, so this week has been… a rollercoaster. I accepted a job offer on the spot. Felt amazing! That burst of adrenaline, the feeling of finally landing somewhere. Then… silence. No confirmation email. Nothing. 

It’s ridiculous, right? You’d think in 2023, a simple automated email would be the bare minimum. Now I’m in this weird limbo, second-guessing everything. Was it real? Did I misunderstand? 

It’s more than just the job itself, though. It’s a reminder – a sharp one – that enthusiasm and quick decisions don't guarantee smooth sailing. It's a lesson in patience, and a slightly unsettling glimpse into how easily things can feel…unanchored. I guess I'll be refreshing my inbox and practicing mindful breathing until I hear back. Wish me luck!
