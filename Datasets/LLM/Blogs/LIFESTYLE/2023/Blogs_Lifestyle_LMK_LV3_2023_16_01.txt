"Boosting Productivity: My Journey with Active Recall and Spaced Repetition

As a student in 2023, I've struggled to retain information despite spending hours studying. It wasn't until I stumbled upon the concept of active recall and spaced repetition that I finally found a solution. I started using a combination of ChatGPT, Anki, and handwritten notes to supercharge my learning.

At first, it was a bit of a challenge to adjust to this new study technique. I'd generate summaries of my notes using ChatGPT, create digital flashcards on Anki, and review them regularly using spaced repetition. I'd also make sure to take handwritten notes during classes to reinforce my understanding. But as I stuck to it, I noticed a significant improvement in my retention rates.

The beauty of active recall lies in its simplicity. By actively recalling information through flashcards and practice quizzes, I'm forcing my brain to work harder, strengthening the connections between neurons and solidifying the information in my long-term memory. Anki's spaced repetition algorithm takes it a step further by optimizing the review process, ensuring I see the material just before I'm about to forget it.

This study technique has not only improved my productivity but also given me a sense of confidence in my ability to learn. I've been able to tackle complex topics with ease, and my grades have reflected the hard work. If you're struggling to retain information, I highly recommend giving active recall and spaced repetition a try. It may just be the game-changer you need to take your learning to the next level."
