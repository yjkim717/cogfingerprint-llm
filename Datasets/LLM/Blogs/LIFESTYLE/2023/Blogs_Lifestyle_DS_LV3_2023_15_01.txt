It’s 2023, and my morning scroll stopped me cold: a Twitter account openly glorifying ISIS, sharing violent propaganda. I wanted to report it, to do my small part, but the process was a maze. No clear option for terrorism. It made me reflect on our digital lifestyle—how our peaceful routines exist just a click away from such darkness. It’s a stark reminder that our online world demands our vigilance, not just our engagement. Staying silent isn’t an option.
