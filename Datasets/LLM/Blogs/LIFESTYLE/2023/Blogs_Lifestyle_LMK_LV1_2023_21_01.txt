As I sit here listening to my latest audiobook obsession, I'm reminded that there's a whole world of fiction beyond fantasy. I've recently devoured thrillers like Gillian Flynn's "Gone Girl" and mysteries like "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides. Historical fiction like "All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr has also captivated me. In 2023, I'm making a conscious effort to diversify my reading list - and I'm loving the journey.
