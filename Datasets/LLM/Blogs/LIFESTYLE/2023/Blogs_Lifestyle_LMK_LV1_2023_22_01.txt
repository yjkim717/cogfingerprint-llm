"Navigating Walt Disney World with a large group can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to Genie+ and Lightning Lane reservations. As I planned our 2023 trip with two families, I realized the key to a stress-free vacation is strategy. We booked our Genie+ reservations at 7 am sharp, snagging popular attractions like Space Mountain. By coordinating our Lightning Lane selections, we maximized our time and minimized wait. With a little planning, our group of eight enjoyed a magical, hassle-free experience. If you're tackling Disney with a crowd, trust me, it's worth getting Genie+ sorted early - your sanity will thank you!"
