It’s funny how a simple pair of tights can make you rethink your whole approach to spending. Last year, I splurged on Bliss Club’s “premium” tights, expecting seamless perfection. But there I was, staring in the mirror at those stubborn panty lines—proof that a high price tag doesn’t always mean a flawless fit.

On a whim, I grabbed a pair from Decathlon for a fraction of the cost. Not only did they hold up better during my morning runs, but they also offered smoother coverage. It was a small lesson in 2023: sometimes, the real luxury is finding value where you least expect it.
