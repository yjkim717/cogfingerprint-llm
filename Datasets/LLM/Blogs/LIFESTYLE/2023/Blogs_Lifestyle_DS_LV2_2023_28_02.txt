It’s funny how a hobby can teach you patience. Last year, I decided to finally master my Genmitsu CNC router. I spent hours in Fusion 360, wrestling with feed rates and G-code, chasing that perfect cut. It was frustrating, but in the quiet hum of the machine, I found a strange peace. It wasn't about the final product, but the process—a reminder that in our fast-paced 2023 world, slowing down to learn something new is its own small, satisfying victory.
