Navigating Delhi’s vibrant chaos with my family felt like a puzzle—until we found our home base: a cozy hotel tucked just far enough from the main roads to dodge the relentless traffic, yet close to all the must-see attractions. Staying within our $300-a-night budget meant more for spontaneous rickshaw rides and street food feasts. In 2023, we learned that the right stay doesn’t just save money; it weaves convenience into every memory made together.
