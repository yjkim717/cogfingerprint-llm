"As I chatted with my Polish friend recently, I was struck by their hesitation to visit Kyiv for a construction project. Understandably, the ongoing war has raised concerns about safety. But, having spent time in Ukraine's capital, I can attest that despite the challenges, Kyiv remains a vibrant city. Of course, precautions are necessary, but with some planning, a visit can be manageable. As we weigh the risks, we're reminded that even in uncertain times, there's still room for exploration and connection â€“ and sometimes, that's exactly what we need to rediscover our sense of normalcy."
