## The Little Ring, The Big Question (& Aussie Shipping!)

Okay, so I've been eyeing the Oura Ring for ages â€“ the sleep tracking and wellness insights sound amazing! But I hit a snag today. Trying to figure out the pricing from down here in Australia, and the website is *not* making it easy. Is that $299 USD? And what about shipping? It's frustrating when online stores don't clearly display regional pricing. Anyone else dealt with this? Any tips for getting your Oura Ring to Australia without breaking the bank?
