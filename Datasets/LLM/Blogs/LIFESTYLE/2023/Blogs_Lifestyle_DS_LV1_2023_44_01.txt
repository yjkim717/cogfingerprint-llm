The notification popped up on my phone: “You have 9 vacation days remaining.” For years, that message was a source of guilt, a reminder of time I was too busy to claim. But in 2023, something shifted. I decided to use them—all of them—on a solo trip.

I booked a flight to Portugal, drawn by promises of sun-warmed stone, dramatic coastal vistas, and pasteis de nata. As a solo traveler, the planning was entirely my own. No compromises. I wandered through Lisbon’s intricate Manueline architecture, ate grilled sardines at a tiny family-run tasca, and watched the sunset from a clifftop in the Algarve, answerable to no one’s schedule but my own.

That trip taught me that my vacation days aren’t just a corporate allowance; they are pockets of potential, a mandatory pause to rediscover my own curiosity. Now, I see that notification not as a guilt trip, but as an invitation. The world is full of warm, welcoming places, and I have a standing appointment to go find them.
