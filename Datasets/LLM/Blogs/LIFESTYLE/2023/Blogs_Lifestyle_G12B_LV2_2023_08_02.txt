## Tiny Bathroom, Big Dreams (and a Little Bit of Wonderland)

Isn't it funny how the smallest spaces can hold the biggest projects? We just bought our first home, and I’m knee-deep in a mini-reno of the guest bathroom. It’s *tiny*, folks. Seriously, you practically have to do a little dance to brush your teeth.

But it's also a blank canvas! I’ve been obsessing over textured walls – thinking a subtle knockdown texture might add some visual interest. And then… the rabbit hole began. I'm leaning towards a whimsical vibe, maybe inspired by *Alice in Wonderland*. Imagine a few framed mushroom photos, a pop of unexpected color...

It’s more than just decorating, you know? It’s about creating a little pocket of joy, a space that reflects *us*. Even a small bathroom can be a statement. Anyone else finding that home projects are a journey of self-discovery as much as they are about paint and tile? Let me know!
