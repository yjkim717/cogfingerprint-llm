### The Lie I Was Sold: Unlearning What Porn Taught Me About Intimacy

I used to think I was an expert on sex. My education wasn’t from awkward school health classes or heartfelt talks with my parents, but from the endless, on-demand universe of internet pornography. For years, I consumed it casually, convinced it was just harmless entertainment. It wasn't until a relationship started to fray at the edges that I realized I hadn't been learning about sex; I’d been brainwashed into a performance.

The wake-up call was a quiet, crushing moment. My partner and I were being intimate, and instead of being present with her—feeling the warmth of her skin, getting lost in the connection—my mind was a frantic director. *Is this the right move? Am I lasting long enough? Is this what she expects?* I was so busy trying to replicate a script I’d seen a thousand times that I had completely checked out of my own body and our shared experience. The intimacy wasn't about "us" anymore; it was about "me" and my ability to perform a role.

That’s the insidious thing about porn addiction—and yes, I’ve come to call it that. It’s not just about the time spent watching; it’s about how the fiction seeps into your reality and rewires your expectations. My brain had been marinating in a world where sex was a transaction, a spectacle of acrobatics and manufactured pleasure. Genuine intimacy—the slow, sometimes awkward, deeply vulnerable act of truly connecting with another human being—was nowhere in the picture. I had confused intimacy with performance, and in doing so, I was starving us both of the real thing.

The unlearning process, which I began in earnest in 2023, has been the real education. It started with a digital detox, a conscious choice to step away from the endless scroll of fantasy. The silence was uncomfortable at first, but it created space for something else: curiosity. I started reading about the science of attachment and the psychology of intimacy. I began having painfully honest conversations with my partner, not about performance, but about desire, fear, and what truly made us feel close.

The most profound shift has been redefining what "good sex" means. It’s no longer a checklist of acts or a stopwatch event. It’s the comfort of a shared laugh when we bump heads. It’s the safety of being fully seen, anxieties and all, and accepted completely. It’s the electric charge of a lingering kiss that has no agenda other than to express love. This is the antithesis of what I learned from a screen. It’s messy, it’s human, and it’s real.

Letting go of the performer’s mindset has been like shedding a skin I didn’t know I was wearing. The pressure is gone, replaced by a focus on mutual presence. I’m not perfect at it—old habits whisper sometimes—but the goal is no longer to put on a show. The goal is simply to connect. And in that connection, I’ve found a depth of intimacy and satisfaction that no fictional world could ever hope to replicate.
