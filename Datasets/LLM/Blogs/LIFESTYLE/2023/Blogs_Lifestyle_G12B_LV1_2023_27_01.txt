>## The Chicken or the Egg: Building Connection in a Digital World

It's 2023, and everyone's talking about "super apps" and thriving online communities. I've been thinking a lot about how brands are trying to build both simultaneously, especially in the e-commerce space. It feels a little backwards, doesn’t it? 

Launching a new app and *then* expecting users to organically form a passionate community? It’s like asking for a garden to bloom before you’ve even planted the seeds. Shouldn’t we first build a reputation, deliver a solid product, and then cultivate connection? I’m finding that genuine community flourishes when there’s something real to connect *over*, not just an empty platform. Just a thought!
