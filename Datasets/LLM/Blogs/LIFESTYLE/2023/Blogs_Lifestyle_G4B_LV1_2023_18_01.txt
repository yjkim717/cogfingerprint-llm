**Keeping the Cousins Close (Even When Miles Apart)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We build these sprawling extended families – aunts, uncles, cousins – and then life just… happens. Suddenly, those regular weekend game nights are a distant memory, and the only connection we have with our cousins feels like a quick text every few months. 

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about this, especially with my own kids. I want them to cherish those sibling connections, and I realize it starts with nurturing those cousin bonds. It’s not about constant video calls, but about finding ways to share experiences. 

This year, we’ve started a virtual “family scrapbook,” where cousins contribute photos and memories. It's amazing to see them reminiscing about silly childhood moments!  It’s a gentle reminder that even with family distance, those shared experiences are what truly tie us together. What little things are you doing to keep your family close?
