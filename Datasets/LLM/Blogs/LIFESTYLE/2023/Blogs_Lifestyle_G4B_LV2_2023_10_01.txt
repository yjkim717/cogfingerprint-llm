**The Quiet Shift**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much of our lives is built on reflexes? For years, I had a reflex – a deeply ingrained one – to reach for a drink when things felt…heavy. Like a dull ache in my chest, or a wave of anxiety threatening to pull me under. It was a terrible, comforting habit. 

This year, 2023, I’ve been really trying to dismantle that habit. And honestly, it’s been *sobering*. Not in a depressing way, but in a profoundly clarifying one. I realized how much of my emotional landscape had been sculpted by alcohol – how it muted some feelings and amplified others. 

Now, I'm learning to find healthier ways to navigate those feelings. A walk, a really good book, a chat with a friend – small things that don't involve chasing a temporary buzz. It’s a slow process, a constant recalibration, but there's a quiet shift happening. I’m starting to feel…more present, more grounded.  It’s a mood enhancer, in a way I never anticipated.
