It was supposed to be a quick setup for my new Wyze cam last week, but the promised 2FA email codes were a no-show. I felt that familiar digital frustration creeping in. Then I remembered an old tech article and switched to TOTP with an authenticator app. Suddenly, it just worked. Itâ€™s funny how in 2023, the simplest, most reliable solutions are often the ones we overlook, hiding in plain sight all along. A small tech win for a calmer smart home.
