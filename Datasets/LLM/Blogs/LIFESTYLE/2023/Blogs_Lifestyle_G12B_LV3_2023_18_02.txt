## Sea Glass Sparkle & Little Hands: A Summer Project

There's something magical about collecting sea glass, isn't there? This summer, my five-year-old and I have been turning our hikes into treasure hunts. We’ve amassed a beautiful pile of frosted gems! Now, we’re tackling a simple project: decorating a little plant stand. It’s not about perfection, but about the joy of creating something together, a little sparkle of summer memory solidified in a craft. It's those moments that truly matter.
