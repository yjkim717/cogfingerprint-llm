The gentle hum of the coffee shop is my office today, my laptop open to wireframes. But my mind keeps drifting—first to the tarot cards I saw online, then to that new kickboxing class I’m too intimidated to try. I’m craving a real conversation, something beyond pixels and prototypes. Anyone want to trade book recommendations or debate the best movie of 2023? Sometimes, the best designs are inspired by the messy, beautiful chaos of life outside the screen.
