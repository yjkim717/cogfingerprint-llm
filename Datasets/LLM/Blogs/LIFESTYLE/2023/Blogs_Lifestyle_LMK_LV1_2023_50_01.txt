"Should I ditch sales for coding? That's been on my mind lately. As a 24-year-old sales pro, I've been feeling stuck, and the tech world is beckoning. I'm drawn to JavaScript and React - the idea of building something from scratch is exhilarating. But, I'm also wary of the risks. With AI automation on the rise, I'm worried that my new skills will be obsolete in no time. Will I just be trading one uncertain career for another? Despite my doubts, I feel a thrill at the prospect of joining the coding community. I've started dipping my toes in online courses, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. Who knows, maybe I'll be the one building the next big thing - or at the very least, I'll have a new skillset to fall back on. The question is, am I brave enough to take the leap?"
