**Is Burning Everything to the Ground *Really* the Best Strategy?**

There’s something deeply satisfying about a swift, brutal expansion in a game like EU4 – that feeling of claiming territory with ruthless efficiency. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with this in Crusader Kings III, obsessing over razing provinces to accelerate my empire’s growth. It feels…strategic, right? But staring at a map littered with charred ruins, I’m starting to wonder if it’s actually sustainable. 

It’s a surprisingly relatable feeling, isn’t it? Sometimes we chase immediate gains, sacrificing long-term stability for a quick win. Maybe the best strategy isn’t always the most aggressive – perhaps a little patience and thoughtful development is the key to building something truly lasting.
