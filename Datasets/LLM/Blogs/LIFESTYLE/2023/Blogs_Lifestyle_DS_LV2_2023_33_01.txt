It’s funny how life pulls you in unexpected directions. I never planned to be knee-deep in code one moment and editing video the next, but here I am in 2023, trying to weave these two passions into a career—no CS degree in sight. Some days, I feel like a digital nomad, bridging the gap between the logical world of programming and the creative flow of video production. It’s messy, sometimes overwhelming, but deeply fulfilling. I’m learning that maybe the most interesting paths aren’t the straight ones laid out for us, but the winding trails we carve ourselves. And honestly? That’s what makes the journey worth sharing.
