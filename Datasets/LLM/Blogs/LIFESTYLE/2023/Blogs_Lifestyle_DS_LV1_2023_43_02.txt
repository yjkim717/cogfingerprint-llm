### The Code and The Canvas

I was wrestling with a massive AI model, trying to get it to add a simple feature to my old, cluttered codebase. It kept failing, tripped up by its own limited "context window"—it couldn't hold the entire project in its mind at once.

It struck me how much this mirrors my own life in 2023. I’ve been trying to "add new features"—like a meditation habit or more reading—without clearing out the old, noisy code of my routines. The context window of my day is only so big. The lesson, from GPT-4 to me? Before you can add something new, you have to make space, decluttering the mental workspace to let the real change compile.
