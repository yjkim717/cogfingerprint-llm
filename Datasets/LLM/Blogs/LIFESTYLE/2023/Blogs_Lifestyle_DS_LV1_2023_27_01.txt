It’s funny—in 2023, we’re all curating our lives like social media feeds. I used to think building a community around my new side hustle had to come first, but lately, I’ve wondered: should I figure out my own “brand” before inviting everyone in? It’s like decorating a home before hosting a party. Maybe clarity in who I am makes the connections richer. After all, a strong foundation turns a house into a home, online and off.
