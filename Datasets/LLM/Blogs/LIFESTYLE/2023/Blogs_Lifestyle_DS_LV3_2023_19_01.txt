Last year, I decided to tackle my first big DIY project: rehanging drywall after relocating some outlets. I was so proud until I realized I’d mudded over the old screw holes. Now, I’m nervously waiting to see if those hidden weak spots will betray me. It’s a funny reminder that even our best efforts in life sometimes come with unseen risks we just have to live with.
