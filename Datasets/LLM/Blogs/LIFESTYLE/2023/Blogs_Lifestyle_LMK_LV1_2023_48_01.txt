Planning a family trip to Delhi can be a thrilling experience. As I sit here in 2023, reminiscing about my last trip, I'm reminded of the chaos that comes with choosing the perfect hotel. With a family of four and a budget of $300 per night, the options can be overwhelming. For our 3-day adventure in December, I opted for a budget-friendly hotel in a prime location. Transportation was a breeze, with taxis readily available. If you're planning a similar trip, I'd be happy to share my top hotel recommendations that cater to families like mine.
