>## The White Ford Explorer and My Rising Anxiety

Okay, I need to get this off my chest. Has anyone else noticed… there are *so many* white Ford Explorers on the road these days? Seriously, it’s become a bit unsettling. I'm not usually one to dwell on cars, but lately, I’ve found myself doing a double-take more than once, instinctively bracing for a traffic stop. 

It sounds silly, I know. But there's a growing feeling – and I’ve seen it echoed online – that some people are intentionally choosing this vehicle because it bears a striking resemblance to a police SUV. And the thought of that, of someone *trying* to mimic authority, just fuels a weird anxiety.

It's 2023, and traffic is stressful enough. Do we really need to add the potential for misidentification and, frankly, some pretty aggressive driving behavior into the mix? I just hope everyone out there is driving safely and respectfully, regardless of what their car looks like. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but it’s a thought that’s been lingering with me.
