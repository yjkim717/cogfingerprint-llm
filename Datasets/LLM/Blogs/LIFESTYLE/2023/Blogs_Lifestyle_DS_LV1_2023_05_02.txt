### Finding My Sea Legs Again

It’s been 15 years. A lot has changed since I last paddled out, but the feeling is the same—a mix of pure awe and sheer terror. The ocean hasn’t gotten any smaller, and my nerve seems to have shrunk.

Back then, I was fearless, dropping in on waves without a second thought. Now, as a beginner all over again, I’m humbled. My first session back in 2023 was a comedy of errors: mistiming my pop-up, misjudging the gentle wave size, and swallowing more saltwater than I care to admit. The fear is real, a voice whispering, "You’re not 25 anymore."

But here’s the thing I’m re-learning: it’s not about conquering the wave. It’s about the quiet moments between sets, floating on my board. It’s about the shared nod with another surfer in the lineup. It’s about showing up, despite the fear.

This isn’t just about surfing; it’s about reclaiming a piece of myself I thought was lost to time. And that first, proper drop-in? I can feel it’s just around the corner.
