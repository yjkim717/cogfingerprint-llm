The Condom Conundrum: A Lesson in Life's Unpredictability. In a moment of mischief, I poked holes in a condom, thinking I'd trick my husband into having a baby. But life had other plans - we didn't conceive, and instead, I ended up with a scare that left me reevaluating my approach to family planning. This unexpected twist taught me that sometimes, the best-laid plans can go awry. As I look back, I realize that life's unpredictability is what makes it so beautifully surprising, and it's a lesson I'll carry with me as I navigate 2023 and beyond.
