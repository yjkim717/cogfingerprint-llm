As I sat down to edit my latest video project using FFmpeg, I couldn't help but think about my unconventional path into the world of computer science. Without a CS degree, I was determined to leverage my multimedia skills to carve out a niche in web development. In 2023, the lines between tech and creativity are blurring, and I'm excited to be at the forefront. By combining my passion for video programming with my growing CS skills, I'm forging a unique career path that's both fulfilling and in-demand. It's a journey that's teaching me to be adaptable, curious, and always learning.
