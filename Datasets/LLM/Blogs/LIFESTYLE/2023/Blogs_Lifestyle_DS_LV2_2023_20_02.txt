It’s 2023, and I’m thinking about stress—the kind that follows us from childhood into adulthood. A researcher recently asked me about photographing a school lockdown drill for an article. It hit me: we carry these moments with us, don’t we? The drills, the tension—they shape how we handle pressure long after we’ve left the classroom. Maybe understanding that early stress is the first step toward building a more resilient, mindful life today.
