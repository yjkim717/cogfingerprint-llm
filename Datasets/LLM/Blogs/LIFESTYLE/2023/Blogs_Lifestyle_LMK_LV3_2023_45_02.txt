"Renovating my home in 2023 made me question everything. When I wanted to replace my old vinyl flooring with cozy carpet, my installer claimed they were the only ones who could do it without damaging the existing floor. I wondered, is this true? As I dug deeper, I realized that understanding my flooring options was key to a stress-free renovation. Was I being misled, or was there more to carpet installation than I thought?"
