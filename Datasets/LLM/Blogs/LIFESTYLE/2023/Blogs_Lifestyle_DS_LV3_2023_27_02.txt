It’s 2023, and my Instagram feed is a highlight reel of targeted ads—including the persistent bliss club tights promising the holy grail: no panty lines. I caved, lured by sleek branding and glowing reviews. But slipping them on felt like a letdown. That price tag? Overpriced. And the visible panty line? Still there, clear as day. Honestly, I felt so disappointed. My go-to Decathlon pair costs a fraction and performs flawlessly. Lesson learned: sometimes, the quiet alternatives outshine the hyped-up stars.
