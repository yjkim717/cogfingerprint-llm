## The Illusion of Authority & My Afternoon Drive

Something weird happened on my commute today. I swear, for a solid five minutes, I was playing a bizarre game of "Is that a cop?" because of the sheer number of white Ford Explorers on the road. It got me thinking – why *that* car? Why *that* color? 

It’s a strange little anxiety, isn't it? This subconscious expectation of authority, of rules being enforced. Maybe it’s just the general stress of 2023, but I found myself hyper-aware of their movements, instinctively yielding. It made me realize how easily we project assumptions onto others, and how a simple color choice can trigger a whole cascade of reactions. Just a reminder to breathe, and remember not everyone in a white SUV is patrolling the streets!



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
