As I sat at my desk, staring blankly at lines of code on my screen, I couldn't help but wonder: can AI really help me scale my programming projects? I've been experimenting with GPT 4, and while it's been a game-changer for generating new code snippets, I've hit a roadblock when it comes to editing existing codebases. It's like trying to navigate a complex maze - GPT 4 can suggest detours, but it often gets lost in the twists and turns. I'm not alone in this struggle, and I'm curious - how are others using large language models to tackle the challenge of code editing? As I ponder this, I've started thinking about how this mirrors my own approach to lifestyle changes in 2023. Just as I'm seeking a more scalable solution to code editing, I'm striving for a more balanced lifestyle, one that integrates technology in a way that enhances my productivity, not hinders it.
