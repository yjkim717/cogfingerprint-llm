"Raising a Trilingual Superstar: My Language Journey"

As I sit here in 2023, surrounded by the chaos of family life, I'm reminded of the countless times I've been asked for language advice by fellow parents of multilingual kids. My own child is trilingual, and navigating the world of language homework and extracurricular activities has been a wild ride. When we first started using the OPOL (One Parent, One Language) approach, I was determined to stick to it, but it wasn't always easy. Now, my child is thriving, and I'm often approached by parents seeking guidance on everything from language learning strategies to introducing a new language to the mix (yes, we're even considering a fourth!). As I look back on our journey, I'm struck by the importance of patience, consistency, and making language learning fun. If you're a fellow multilingual family, I'd love to hear about your experiences - and offer any advice I can!
