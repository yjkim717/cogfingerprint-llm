There’s something special about gathering 25 people in a cozy, private room at a local restaurant—especially after a long day at the convention center in 2023. It wasn’t just about convenience; it was about connection. We wanted a place with character, where the menu felt approachable for everyone, from adventurous foodies to those sticking to familiar favorites. Laughter echoed off the walls as we shared stories over plates of accessible, delicious cuisine. In a world that often feels digital and distant, moments like these remind me how vital it is to break bread together, creating memories that linger long after the last bite.
