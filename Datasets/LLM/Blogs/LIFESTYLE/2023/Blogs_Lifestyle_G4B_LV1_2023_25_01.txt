**The Weight of ‘Maybe’**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily “maybe” can become a heavy thing? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with this feeling – a quiet, persistent urge to build a family, but my partner just…doesn’t seem to want to go there. We’ve talked about it, of course, but it feels like a wall’s been erected. 

I found myself researching everything – fertility, timing, even, embarrassingly, exploring unconventional ideas. It’s a vulnerable space, wanting something so deeply and feeling like you’re pushing against a current.  I’m learning that sometimes, the bravest thing isn’t forcing a connection, but accepting the quiet, and figuring out how to move forward *together*, whatever that looks like.
