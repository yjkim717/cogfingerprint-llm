## The Weight of the Unsaid, and Finding Space to Share

It's funny, isn't it, how much weight we carry around in the unspoken? I've been thinking about that a lot lately. Not in a dramatic, heavy-hearted way, but just… noticing it. Like a small stone in your shoe you’ve been ignoring for miles.

I’ve been exploring recovery spaces, and one thing that’s really struck me is the different ways people choose to talk about their past. Some folks lay everything bare, detailed accounts of the lows and the choices. Others are more guarded, focusing on the *feeling* of being lost, without getting into specifics. And then there are those who simply state, “I used to struggle,” and leave it at that.

There’s no right or wrong, of course. It's intensely personal. But observing these different approaches has made me consider my own tendencies towards silence.  I tend to gloss over a lot, to smooth things out, to present a "presentable" version of myself.  It's a habit, I think, born from a desire to protect myself and others.

But lately, I've been questioning if that protection is actually a form of holding back. If those unspoken pieces are still contributing to that little stone in my shoe. Maybe sharing, even in small ways, with trusted people, can lighten the load. It's a process, a slow unraveling. And it's a reminder that vulnerability, in all its forms, isn't weakness; it’s a path to something lighter, something truer. 2023 feels like a year for unearthing those stones, one small step at a time.
