## The Unexpected Joy of Slowing Down (and Learning to Knit)

It’s funny, isn’t it? How life can throw you curveballs. Just a few months ago, I was chasing *everything* – the next project, the perfect workout, the flawlessly organized home. 2023 felt like a constant sprint. Then, burnout hit. Hard.

So I did something completely out of character: I picked up knitting needles. Seriously. I always thought it was…grandma stuff. But there’s a surprising quiet satisfaction in the repetitive motion, in creating something tangible with my own hands. 

It’s forced me to slow down. To appreciate the small moments. To realize that "perfect" is the enemy of "done." My scarf is wonky, riddled with mistakes, but I made it. And that, in itself, feels like a victory. Sometimes, the best way to recharge isn't a grand adventure, but a simple, slow, and slightly imperfect creation. What unexpected hobbies have helped *you* find a little peace lately?
