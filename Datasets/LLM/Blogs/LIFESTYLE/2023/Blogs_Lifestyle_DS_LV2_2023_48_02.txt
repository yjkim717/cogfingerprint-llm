The miles were burning a hole in my KrisFlyer account, a digital souvenir from years of work trips. This time, it was different. It wasn't about a solo business class escape, but a family adventure to Tokyo. The question haunted me: was Premium Economy worth the extra miles for the four of us?

I pictured us crammed in Economy, the kids restless after hour five. Then I imagined itâ€”the wider seats, the extra recline, the simple luxury of not elbowing my spouse for armrest dominion. This wasn't just a flight; it was the start of our holiday. The moment I saw the "Award Travel Available" tag on those Premium Economy seats, the decision felt clear.

Sometimes, the best investment isn't in a stock, but in your family's comfort and the memory of a journey that begins with a peaceful sigh at 35,000 feet. For us, in 2023, it was absolutely worth it.
