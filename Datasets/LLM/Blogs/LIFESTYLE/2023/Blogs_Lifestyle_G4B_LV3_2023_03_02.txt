**The Tightrope Walk of Sharing – and Not Sharing – in Recovery**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Being in a room full of people who *get it*, who’ve wrestled with demons similar to your own, and yet feeling this incredibly intense pressure to… share? Specifically, to talk about the messy details of your past with alcohol and drug use. 

I’ve been attending AA meetings regularly this year, and I’ve noticed a fascinating spectrum of approaches to this. Some folks dive right in, recounting specific incidents with brutal honesty. It’s powerful, undeniably, and clearly helps them feel seen and understood. But then there are others who tread carefully, offering a more generalized account – “I struggled with addiction,” versus “I relapsed after a particularly bad night at the bar, involving a fight and a lost job.” 

It’s like walking a tightrope. You want to be vulnerable, to connect, to offer a lifeline to someone else struggling. But you also instinctively protect yourself, creating a shield against the potential pain of reliving those dark moments. 

I realized recently that there’s no ‘right’ way. What matters isn’t *what* you share, but *why*.  Is it a genuine desire to connect and support others, or are you trying to prove something, to earn validation? 

For me, I’m still learning to find that balance. It’s okay to hold back, to prioritize my own well-being while still offering a supportive presence in the room.  Recovery isn't about broadcasting your story; it’s about building a new one, one step at a time.
