## The Unexpected Fuel for Design (and Life)

Okay, so maybe my routine looks a little… eclectic. It’s 2023, and I’m a UX designer, which already feels like a blend of logic and creativity. But lately, I’ve been leaning *hard* into the unexpected. 

Most days, you’ll find me hunched over my laptop at "The Daily Grind," my local coffee shop, ostensibly working on wireframes. But nestled amongst the latte art and keyboard clicks, you might also spot a deck of tarot cards or catch me jotting down notes after a particularly intense kickboxing class. 

It sounds chaotic, I know. But honestly? It’s been incredible. The quiet contemplation of a tarot pull often sparks a fresh perspective on a design problem. And the adrenaline from kickboxing? Pure, focused energy. Plus, I'm always on the lookout for good book recommendations from the regulars! It’s a weird, wonderful blend that’s surprisingly fueling both my work and my life.
