It’s 2023, and I’m still reeling from a story a friend shared: her doctor actually suggested poking holes in a condom to “solve” her disagreement with her husband about having a baby. I couldn’t believe it—how could a trusted professional cross such a clear ethical line? It made me reflect on how vital it is to advocate for ourselves, even with experts. Consent and trust are the bedrock of any relationship, and no goal justifies undermining them. Some advice, no matter the source, just isn’t worth taking.
