It’s funny how something as simple as a car color can shape your day. Lately, every time I see a white Ford Explorer in my rearview mirror, my heart does this little jump. For a split second, I’m checking my speed, my hands tighten on the wheel—is it the police?

Of course, 99% of the time, it’s just another SUV. But that moment of anxiety is real. It’s made me realize how much of our daily stress comes from these tiny, unconscious triggers. I’ve even started noticing how many people drive them, a sea of white Explorers that keep us all just a little more on edge. It’s a strange, shared experience of modern driving life in 2023.
