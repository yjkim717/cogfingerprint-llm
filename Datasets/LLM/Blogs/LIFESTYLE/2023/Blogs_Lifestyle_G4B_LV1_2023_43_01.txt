**Finding My Visual Rhythm**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been obsessed with ways to *see* things differently. Like, really *see* them. This year, 2023, I’ve been trying to map out my priorities – not just in a to-do list, but visually. I started experimenting with simple word clouds to represent my monthly goals, then branched out to little bar charts tracking my reading. 

It’s strangely satisfying to translate life’s chaos into something… ordered.  I'm even toying with the idea of a network diagram to show how different projects and commitments connect. It’s a small thing, but it’s helping me gain clarity and, honestly, feel a little more in control.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post on a different topic?
