As I slipped into my Bliss Club tights, I couldn't shake off the disappointment. Visible panty lines stared back at me, a far cry from the seamless comfort I craved. Compared to my trusty Decathlon tights, the difference was stark. The startup fashion darling failed to impress, leaving me questioning its value. It's a reminder that even with innovative ideas, execution is key. In the world of fashion, comfort and practicality should never be compromised. Has the Bliss Club lost its way, or am I just being too picky?
