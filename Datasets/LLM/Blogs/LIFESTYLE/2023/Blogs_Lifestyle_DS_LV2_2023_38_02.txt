It’s funny how a simple task—shipping winter clothes from Delhi—turned into a full-blown logistics puzzle. I stood there at the post office, my cozy sweaters and scarves spilling out of an oversized bag, only to be told they were "too bulky." Defeated, I wondered if I’d have to lug them halfway across the country myself.

Then I remembered a friend’s advice: try a private courier. A quick search led me to a local consigner, and in no time, my winter gear was on its way—affordably and hassle-free. Sometimes, the system’s limitations push you toward better solutions. In 2023, it’s the little detours that remind you to trust the journey, not just the destination.
