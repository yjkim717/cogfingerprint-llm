### The Tree, The Drone, and The Lesson in Letting Go

So, there I was in the fall of 2023, staring up at a stubborn oak tree that had just swallowed my brand-new DJI Mini 3 Pro. One moment I was capturing gorgeous golden-hour footage, and the next, a sudden gust sent my prized possession on a one-way trip into the branches.

My first instinct was a primal one: get it back. I was mentally preparing for a risky climb, already picturing the scrapes and the potential for even more damage. I’d paid for DJI Care Refresh, the insurance that promises peace of mind, but my pride was on the line. This was *my* drone, and I wanted to rescue it myself.

But as I stood there, neck craned, a calmer thought emerged. The whole point of that obstacle avoidance tech and the insurance was to prevent this exact panic. Was a heroic, potentially dangerous recovery attempt worth voiding the warranty or causing harm? Or was this a moment to actually use the safety net I’d invested in?

I took a deep breath and called it in. It felt strangely like a lesson in letting go—of control, of the need to fix everything myself. Sometimes, the smartest move isn't the most dramatic one. It's accepting that things get stuck, and trusting that it’s okay to ask for help to get them down.
