## Delhi with the Crew: Finding That Sweet Spot for Family Fun (and Our Wallets!)

Okay, so planning a family trip to Delhi – it’s exciting, right? But then the logistics hit. We're a family of four, and 2023 has definitely taught us the value of smart spending. We're dreaming of exploring the Red Fort, soaking in the history, and generally experiencing the vibrant energy of Delhi. 

The challenge? Finding a hotel that ticks all the boxes *without* breaking the bank. We're aiming for around $300 a night – a decent budget, but still requires some careful consideration! Proximity to the main sights is key, and having easy access to either a driver or the metro is a must for navigating that incredible city. 

Anyone have any Delhi hotel recommendations for a family? Share your wisdom – we're officially in planning mode and open to all suggestions! Let's make this trip unforgettable (and affordable!).
