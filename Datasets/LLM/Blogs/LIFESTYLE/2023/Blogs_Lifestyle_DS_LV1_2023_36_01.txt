It’s funny how a simple tech hiccup can shift your perspective. Last month, my Wyze camera’s email 2FA codes stopped arriving, leaving me locked out and frustrated. After a bit of digging, I switched to an authenticator app with TOTP—problem solved. But it made me think: in 2023, we’re all juggling digital lives. Sometimes, the smallest tweak—like embracing a better tool—can bring back peace of mind. It’s a reminder to pause, reassess, and simplify where we can, both online and off.
