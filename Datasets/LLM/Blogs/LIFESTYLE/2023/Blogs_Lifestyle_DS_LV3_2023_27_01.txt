Launching our e-commerce super app in 2023, I was all-in on community building from day one. But a teammate’s question stopped me: “Shouldn’t people love our brand first?” It hit home. We were so eager to create a social media buzz that we overlooked the foundation. A true community isn’t just built; it’s earned through trust and shared values. Now, I see that fostering genuine brand association is the real first step—the community will naturally follow when people believe in what we stand for.
