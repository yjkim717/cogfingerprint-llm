## The Quiet Loss of a Lavender Rose

There’s a particular ache that comes with losing a plant you truly loved. This past spring, I mourned the passing of my lavender rose – a color so unique, so delicate, it felt like holding a twilight sky in my hand. Winter claimed it, sadly. Now, I’m on the hunt for a replacement, hoping to recapture that quiet joy of tending to something so beautifully unusual. It’s a small thing, gardening, but it teaches you about loss and the enduring hope of new blooms.
