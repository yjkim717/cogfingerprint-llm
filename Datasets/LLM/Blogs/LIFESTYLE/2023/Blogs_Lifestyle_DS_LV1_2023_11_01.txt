### The Digital Ghost in the Machine

It started subtly. Every few days, my smart lights would go dumb, my video calls would freeze, and the digital hum of our home would just… stop. The culprit? My little DIY server, a Proxmox box running our network’s brain, an OPNsense firewall. It would enter a silent, unresponsive state, leaving a trail of cryptic `arpresolve` errors in its wake.

It felt like a ghost in the machine, a scheduled reminder of my own limitations. In 2023, we build these intricate digital nests, weaving our lives into networks we barely understand. We chase speed and control, forgetting the simple peace of things that just work.

Fixing it—tweaking the passed-through NIC settings—was a victory. But the real lesson was in the quiet. Those forced disconnections weren't just outages; they were invitations to look up, to talk, to be present. Sometimes, the most advanced tech solution is knowing when to unplug and reset yourself, too.
