## The Cold Truth About Bodyboarding Gloves (and My Frigid Fingers!)

Anyone else battling the glove-grip conundrum this year? Seriously, I’m out here trying to bodyboard in these chilly 2023 waters, attempting a decent duck dive, and my gloves are just…slipping. It’s frustrating! The cold definitely makes it worse. I'm reaching out to fellow board riders – what gloves are actually delivering on grip when the water’s biting? Send help (and recommendations!) my way!
