**The Year I Decided to Run (and Relax) Solo**

2023 felt… full. Over-full, honestly. So, when I started seriously considering a solo trip to Punta Cana, it wasn’t just about escaping. It was about intentionally carving out space for *me*. I’m usually juggling a million things, and the idea of a beachfront resort with a spa was utterly intoxicating. 

I’m currently researching options, hoping to find a place that truly fosters relaxation – a quiet retreat where I can recharge.  Plus, there have to be decent running trails nearby! It’s funny, isn’t it?  Sometimes the best way to find yourself is to simply step away and listen to the rhythm of your own footsteps, and the sound of the waves.
