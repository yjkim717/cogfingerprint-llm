As a therapist in 2023, I've often found myself wondering how to delicately navigate conversations about meaning and self-worth with clients struggling with suicidal thoughts. I worry that exploring these deep-seated issues might inadvertently exacerbate their distress. However, I've come to realize that avoiding the topic altogether can be just as damaging. By creating a safe space and establishing a robust safety plan, I can help clients confront their inner turmoil and uncover a sense of purpose. The key is to approach these conversations with empathy and care.
