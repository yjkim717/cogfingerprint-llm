**The Little Things That Make You Question**

It’s funny how a seemingly small detail can throw you off. I recently snagged a Mitutoyo QuantuMike – a precision tool I’d been eyeing for ages – on eBay. When it arrived, though, something felt…off. No data port. Just a perfectly good micrometer, missing a crucial connection. 

It sparked a weird little thought: how often do we buy things, trust the process, and *not* really scrutinize the details? Like the rise of counterfeits online, it reminds us to be a little more vigilant.  It’s a gentle nudge to slow down and ask, “Is this *really* what I expected?”  Maybe that’s a valuable lesson in 2023.
