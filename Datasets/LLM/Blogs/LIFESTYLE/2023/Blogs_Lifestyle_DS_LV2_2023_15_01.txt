It’s strange, isn’t it? In 2023, our digital and physical lives are so intertwined that a simple scroll can lead you somewhere dark. I was on Twitter the other day, just unwinding, when I stumbled upon an account glorifying terrorism. My cozy evening shattered. Suddenly, I wasn't just a user; I was a guardian of this shared space. It’s a stark reminder that our online lifestyle isn't a passive one. Our clicks and reports are the quiet, daily work of keeping our digital home safe for everyone.
