As I navigated the world of smart home devices in 2023, I found myself torn between upgrading my ductless mini-split system with the latest smart thermostat tech. My goal was simple: a seamless, cloud-free experience that would make my life easier, not more complicated. After digging through reviews and forums, I stumbled upon a few promising options. The Cielo Breeze smart thermostat caught my eye, touting local control and compatibility with my mini-split system. I also considered the Flair Puck, which offered a similarly straightforward approach. As an Android user, I was relieved to find that both options integrated nicely with Google's ecosystem. I'm now enjoying a more streamlined and efficient heating and cooling experience, all without relying on cloud dependencies. It's a small victory, but one that has made a big difference in my daily routine.
