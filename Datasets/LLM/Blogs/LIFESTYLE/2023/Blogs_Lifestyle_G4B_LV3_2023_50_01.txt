**The Robot Next Door: Should I Still Learn to Code?**

Okay, let’s be real – 2023 feels like a year of constant “AI is going to take our jobs” headlines. I’ve been wrestling with a big question myself: what about a career change into software engineering? I’m a young professional, and the thought of building things feels… exciting, but also terrifying. 

Specifically, I’m staring down the barrel of AI automation. It’s hard not to worry about whether learning to code – especially something like React – is even a worthwhile investment when algorithms are getting smarter every day. Part of me wants to dive deep into C, the bedrock of so much, but the pull of a more modern, user-focused language is strong. 

It's a strangely vulnerable feeling, admitting you're considering a shift, wondering if you're chasing a fleeting trend. But maybe, just maybe, the future isn’t about *replacing* programmers with robots, but about *working alongside* them.  What do you think?  Have you been contemplating a similar pivot?
