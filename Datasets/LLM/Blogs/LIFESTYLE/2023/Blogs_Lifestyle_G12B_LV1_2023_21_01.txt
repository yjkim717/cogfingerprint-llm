## Breaking Free From Dragons (and Loving It!)

Okay, confession time: for the last few years, my ears have been firmly planted in the world of fantasy. Dragons, magic, epic quests – you name it, I’ve probably listened to an audiobook about it. But lately, I've felt this… itch. A desire for something different.

So, I’ve been branching out! Trading in enchanted forests for gritty thrillers, sprawling kingdoms for intricate mysteries, and fantastical histories for compelling historical fiction. It’s surprisingly refreshing! It’s 2023, and sometimes you just need a break from saving the world to explore a different kind of story. Any recommendations for a newly-minted non-fantasy reader? Let me know!
