**The Illusion of Control**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we build these little narratives around ourselves, especially when it comes to habits. I used to genuinely believe I could just…will myself to stop drinking. A quiet evening, a clear head – suddenly, I was ‘sober.’ It felt like a switch I could flip. 

But 2023 has been a brutal teacher. That switch? It’s a lie. The cravings, the anxiety, the desperate need – they hit with a force I hadn't anticipated.  It’s terrifying to confront that you’re not in control, that change isn’t a simple decision, but a messy, complicated process. 

Recently, I’ve been spending a lot of time in reflection, trying to understand *why* it felt so easy before, and what’s actually needed now. It’s not about willpower, it's about acknowledging the fear, the deep-seated patterns, and building a new path, one small step at a time.  It’s a humbling, and honestly, a vital shift.
