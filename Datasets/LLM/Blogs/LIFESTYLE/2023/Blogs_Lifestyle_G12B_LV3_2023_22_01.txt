>## The Genie+ Puzzle & Our Family's Disney Dream

Okay, Disney World in 2023 – it's magical, but let's be honest, it's also a *lot* to manage! We’re planning a trip with a big group – grandparents, cousins, the whole shebang – and the Genie+ and Lightning Lane system is giving me a serious headache. 

Trying to coordinate rides for everyone, especially when families want to experience things together, feels like solving a complex puzzle. Will we all get in? Will someone miss out? It’s a little stressful, I won't lie! 

It really makes you think about planning family time in general, doesn't it? Sometimes, even the most well-intentioned efforts to create joy can feel a little overwhelming. Wish us luck wrangling those reservations!
