**The Frustration of the Unreachable**

Anyone else feel that creeping frustration when you *know* you should be able to do something, but something’s just… blocking you? Lately, I’ve been battling a weird digital wall. I was trying to collect some research for a personal project – essentially, a little digital archaeology of old online art – and kept hitting a "Access Denied" error.

It’s a good reminder, isn’t it? Sometimes, the best thing you can do is step back, figure out the obstacle, and find a new way around.  Maybe a different angle, a different tool.  What’s a roadblock you’ve been wrestling with lately?
