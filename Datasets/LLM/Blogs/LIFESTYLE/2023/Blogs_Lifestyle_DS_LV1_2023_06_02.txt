### Finding Joy in the Simple Sips

Remember those frantic pre-2023 parties? The pressure to have the most complex, artisanal everything was exhausting. This year, I’ve been chasing a different vibe: simple, uncomplicated joy.

It found me in a bottle of cookie dough flavored whiskey.

A friend brought it over, and I’ll admit I was skeptical. But one sip was a revelation. It wasn’t trying to be a sophisticated spirit with layers of oak and smoke. It was just… sweet, creamy, and delightfully straightforward. My palette sighed in relief. Now, it’s my go-to. Neat by the fireplace for a cozy night in, or mixed into a cocktail when friends come over—it’s the perfect, effortless party mixer.

It turns out the sweetest things in life aren’t always complicated. Sometimes, they taste like your favorite childhood treat, reminding you that enjoyment doesn’t need a manual.
