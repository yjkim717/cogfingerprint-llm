## Finding My People (and Dragons) Online

It’s funny how you can find unexpected communities in the most random places. For me, it’s been Dungeons & Dragons. I know, I know, it sounds intensely nerdy, and maybe it is! But honestly, it’s become a lifeline in a way I never anticipated.

I'm 22 and navigating that weird in-between space of post-grad life – figuring out work, trying to keep some semblance of a social life, and generally feeling a little… adrift. I've always loved storytelling, and I've always been a bit of a goofball, so I decided to dip my toes back into D&D this year. Specifically, an online campaign. 

Turns out, finding the right group is *everything*. I’ve bounced around a few tables before, but this one… this one feels different. It’s a small, tight-knit group that's genuinely excited about collaborative world-building. We spend half our sessions just brainstorming ridiculous lore and inside jokes – the memes are *flowing*, let me tell you. 

What’s really special is the feeling of safety and acceptance. It’s a genuinely LGBTQ+ friendly space, and that’s been incredibly validating. Being able to explore my character's identity without hesitation, to contribute to a story where inclusivity is a given, is…well, it’s powerful.

It’s more than just rolling dice and slaying monsters (though that's fun too!). It’s about finding a place where I can be myself, be creative, and connect with people who *get* it. In a world that often feels isolating, this little online campaign has become a surprisingly vibrant and supportive corner of my week. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for all the treasure in the Forgotten Realms.
