As a first-time viewer diving into One Piece in 2023, I’ve hit the Skypea arc—and honestly, I’m a little worried. Friends and fellow fans warned me: “It drags,” or “This is where I dropped it.” Their doubts planted seeds of hesitation in my own journey. But isn’t life like that too? We let others’ fears shape our paths before we’ve even taken a step. So, I’m choosing to press play with an open mind, embracing the adventure as my own. After all, every story deserves its chance to unfold.
