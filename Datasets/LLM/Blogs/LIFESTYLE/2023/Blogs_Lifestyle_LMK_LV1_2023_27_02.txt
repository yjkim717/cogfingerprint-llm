As I navigated the world of athleisure wear in 2023, I was excited to try Bliss Club's trendy tights. However, my enthusiasm was short-lived. The panty line coverage was a major letdown, especially considering the hefty price tag. To my surprise, Decathlon's affordable options outperformed Bliss Club in this aspect. As a startup enthusiast, I was rooting for Bliss Club, but their failure to deliver on a key feature left me disappointed. Has the startup's focus on style overshadowed functionality?
