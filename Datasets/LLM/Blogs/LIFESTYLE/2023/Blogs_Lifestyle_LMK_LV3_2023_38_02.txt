As I navigated the chaos of travel preparations in early 2023, I faced a familiar conundrum: how to send my bulky winter clothes to my parents without breaking the bank. The post office was a nightmare, with long queues and unclear pricing. After some research, I discovered a private consigner that made the process seamless. It was a small victory, but it taught me the importance of exploring alternatives when it comes to shipping and logistics. Now, I always consider the best options for parcel delivery and transport to avoid unnecessary stress.
