Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and keeping the 2023 context in mind. I've focused on the themes of meaning and self-worth, drawing a parallel to the therapist's concern about suicidal clients while keeping the piece accessible for a wider audience.

## The Quiet Weight of "What's the Point?"

It’s 2023, and honestly, sometimes the sheer volume of *everything* feels… heavy. Scrolling through endless news, comparing yourself to curated highlight reels online – it’s a recipe for questioning. Lately, I’ve found myself circling around that familiar thought: “What’s the point?” 

It’s a big question, and not always a dramatic one. Sometimes it’s a quiet whisper, a subtle shift in motivation. I think we all grapple with it, especially when life throws curveballs. Remembering that even small acts of kindness, pursuing a simple hobby, or just *being* present can add layers of meaning is a lifeline. We are worthy, regardless of output. And that’s a truth worth holding onto.

**Notes on this draft:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "honestly," "sometimes," and "I think" to create a more personal feel.
*   **Relatability:** The post aims to tap into a common feeling of overwhelm and questioning purpose, particularly relevant in the current digital landscape.
*   **Reflective:** It encourages introspection rather than offering definitive answers.
*   **Connection to Keywords (subtly):** The core themes of meaning and self-worth are central, without explicitly referencing therapy or suicidal clients. This maintains broader appeal.
*   **Length:** Around 118 words, as requested.
