**Is Your Screen Telling You More Than It Should?**

Let’s be honest, 2023 feels like a constant scroll. Between TikTok, Instagram, and, yes, the internet’s darker corners, it’s easy to get lost in a digital current. Lately, I've been doing a lot of thinking about how much time we spend consuming – and how that consumption is actually *feeling*.

I stumbled across some really insightful research the other day about pornography and its impact on our sense of reality. It wasn't about judgment, but about recognizing a pattern: when we consistently engage with highly stylized, often unrealistic depictions of sex, it can subtly shift our perspectives. It’s like looking at a painting for too long – the colors start to bleed, and the edges blur.

Suddenly, our own relationships, our own desires, feel…off. We start holding ourselves and our partners to impossible standards, fueled by a warped understanding of what’s “normal.” It’s a dangerous feedback loop, really, leading to an unhealthy obsession with self-focus and a nagging feeling that something’s missing. 

I’m not saying everyone who enjoys pornography is struggling, but it’s worth taking a step back and asking yourself: how is this impacting your self-perception? Are you craving genuine connection, or are you chasing a fleeting, manufactured version of it online? 

It's about reclaiming your reality, one mindful moment – and one less scroll – at a time.
