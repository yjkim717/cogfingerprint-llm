### Feeling My Way Through 2023

For years, my solution to any big feeling—stress, sadness, even joy—was to pour a drink. It was like an emotional mute button. When I got sober, I panicked. I had stripped away my only tool, and suddenly, every feeling was turned up to a deafening volume. I felt raw and completely unequipped.

My early recovery felt like learning to walk again. I stumbled through support meetings, hearing words like "sit with the feeling" and thinking, "But how?" That's when I reluctantly tried meditation. The first few sessions were just me and a chorus of my own anxious thoughts. But slowly, I learned I didn't have to *fix* the emotion; I just had to acknowledge it was there, a temporary visitor, not a permanent state.

Now, in 2023, my toolkit looks nothing like it used to. A ten-minute breathing exercise often does what a glass of wine never could: it brings genuine calm. Therapy has given me the language to understand my triggers. It’s not about numbing out anymore; it’s about feeling my way through, one sober, clear-headed moment at a time. And honestly? The view from here is so much brighter.
