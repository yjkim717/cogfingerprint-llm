**The Quiet Hum of Connection**

There’s something about a busy coffee shop in 2023 – the clatter of mugs, the whir of laptops, and the low murmur of conversations – that feels both intensely isolating and strangely hopeful. As a freelance UX designer, I find myself gravitating towards them, seeking a little human connection amidst the screen time. 

I’ll often settle in with a book (currently obsessed with Scandinavian noir!), and quietly offer a chat to anyone who looks like they could use one. Lately, it’s been a lifeline.  Sometimes it’s just a quick discussion about design challenges – bouncing ideas off someone who gets it – and other times, it’s a shared moment of loneliness eased by a simple, “How’s your week going?” 

It’s a small thing, but these little pockets of connection feel increasingly valuable.
