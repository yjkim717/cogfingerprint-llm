>## The Ghosts in Our Group Chat (and How I'm Trying to Change That)

It's 2023, and we're more connected than ever, right? Social media, instant messaging… we’re theoretically a click away from everyone we know. Yet, I’ve been feeling a disconnect, specifically with my extended family. My cousins, my siblings – we're spread across the country now, pursuing lives that pull us in different directions.

It hit me the other day while scrolling through old photos. So many memories! Summer vacations, chaotic holiday dinners, inside jokes only we understood. Now, it feels like those are fading, existing more as ghosts in a shared group chat than living, breathing realities. 

We share the occasional meme, a birthday wish, a quick "how are you?" But that's not *connection*. It's surface-level. 

So, I'm making a concerted effort. We've started a weekly video chat – just a casual hour to catch up. I even suggested a monthly themed movie night where we all watch the same film and discuss it afterward. Small steps, maybe, but I’m hoping to bridge the miles and bring those shared experiences back to life. Because family, even the geographically distant kind, deserves more than just fleeting digital glimpses.



Hope this resonates!
