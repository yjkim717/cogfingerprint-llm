You know that feeling when everyone tells you a certain workout class is impossible? That was me with hot yoga last month. My entire feed was flooded with posts about how brutal it was—people dropping like flies, questioning their life choices mid-pose.

I almost canceled my spot twice. But something in me just had to see for myself. So I showed up, towel in hand, heart pounding. And yeah, it was tough. Really tough. But pushing through that initial dread? Incredible.

Sometimes, the noise of others’ experiences can cloud our own journey. In 2023, it’s easy to get swayed by public opinion. But trying things for yourself? That’s where the real growth happens. My mat and I are proof.
