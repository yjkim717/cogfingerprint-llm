As I rummaged through my old electronics stash in 2023, I stumbled upon a burned-out DC motor driver. I was determined to identify the mysterious 'DE' marked component. Using a cheap tester and measuring its dimensions, I discovered it was a zener diode in an SMB package. This tiny epiphany made me realize how often we overlook the tiny things in life. Just like that diode, sometimes it's the smallest components that hold everything together.
