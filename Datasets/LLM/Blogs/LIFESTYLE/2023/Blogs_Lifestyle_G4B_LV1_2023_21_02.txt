**The Super Bowl and a Little Magic**

Okay, so 2023 was *wild*, right? Watching the Philadelphia Eagles steamroll through the playoffs felt… almost predetermined. It got me thinking about Nick Sirianni’s story – how he’d visualize being at the Super Bowl, and then *boom*, it happened. 

It’s weird, isn’t it?  I’ve been experimenting with visualization myself lately, trying to really *feel* the outcome I want for my work.  It’s not about demanding it, more like gently planting the seed and trusting the process.  Like Sirianni's belief, maybe there’s a little bit of magic in focusing on what you desire and letting it unfold.  Who knows, maybe it’s just focused intention – but it's a pretty cool thought, isn’t it?
