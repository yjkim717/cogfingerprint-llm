## The Unexpected Joy of Slow Mornings (and Why I Finally Embraced Them)

Remember the hustle? 2023 felt like it started with a sprint. Everyone was talking about optimizing, maximizing, and *doing*. I was caught up in it too, leaping out of bed before dawn, squeezing in workouts, checking emails *before* coffee… the whole shebang. I felt productive, sure, but also… depleted.

Then, something shifted. Around mid-year, I realized I was missing out. Missing out on the quiet. Missing out on the feeling of *actually* waking up, instead of just jumping into the day's demands. 

It started small. Ten extra minutes in bed. A proper cup of tea, savored instead of gulped. Then, slowly, I started pushing back against the ingrained need to *do* first thing. Now? I wake up, I breathe, I read a few pages of a book, and I just *be* for a little while.

It's not about laziness. It's about intentionality. It’s about recognizing that a calm start sets the tone for everything else. Honestly, I’m more focused, more creative, and surprisingly, *more* productive throughout the day. Who knew slowing down could actually speed things up?  It's been a surprisingly simple, yet powerful, reset.
