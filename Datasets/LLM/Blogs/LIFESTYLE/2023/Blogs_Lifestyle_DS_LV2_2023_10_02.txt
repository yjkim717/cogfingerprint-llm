It’s 2023, and I’m over a year into my sober journey—something I once thought would be impossible. I used to believe quitting drinking was just about willpower, but I’ve learned it’s so much more. It’s about shifting your entire perspective.

At first, I mourned the loss of my old social life, but slowly, I started noticing small joys I’d overlooked for years: clear mornings, genuine conversations, and a quiet confidence that’s grown in place of anxiety. My attitude didn’t change overnight—it evolved through honest reflection and the support of others walking this path.

If you’re on this journey too, know this: it’s not about giving something up, but gaining a deeper connection to yourself. What changes have you noticed along the way?
