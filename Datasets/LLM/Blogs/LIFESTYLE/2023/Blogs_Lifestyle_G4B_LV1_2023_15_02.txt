**The Night the Slugs Took Over My Mind**

Okay, so 2023 has been… a lot, right? Trying to find moments of calm feels like a full-time job. Last week, I decided to try a little something to unwind – a small amount of weed.  I’ve never really been a smoker, but I was curious. 

It started subtly, a bit of a dreamy haze. Then, things got a little weird. I started seeing *slugs*. Seriously, dozens of them, just… crawling across my bedroom wall. It wasn’t a fun visual.  

Suddenly, I was gripped with a surprising wave of panic. Not about the slugs, exactly, but about the entire neighborhood changing – new houses, different people, a shift I wasn't sure I wanted. It was a bizarre, intensely personal fear triggered by a plant. 

It was a really unsettling experience, and a reminder that sometimes, the things we do to relax can unexpectedly bring up some pretty intense emotions.  Definitely a night I won’t forget!
