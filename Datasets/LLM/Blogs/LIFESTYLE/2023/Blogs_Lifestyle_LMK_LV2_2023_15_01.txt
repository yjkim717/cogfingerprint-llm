As I scrolled through Twitter in 2023, a disturbing account caught my eye - an open promoter of ISIS. My first instinct was to report it, but I was taken aback by the lack of a clear 'promoting terrorism' option. This experience left me reflecting on our online safety and the role we play in it. Have we become numb to online harassment? I realized that taking a stand against hate starts with speaking up and using the tools available to us. Let's take responsibility for our online actions and foster a safer digital world together.
