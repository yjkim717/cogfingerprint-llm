It’s 2023, and my husband and I are still navigating the delicate dance of family planning. I’ve been dreaming of a baby; he’s been… hesitant. In a moment of sheer desperation, I confided in my doctor, asking for advice on how to handle our mismatched timelines. I must have phrased it poorly, because her eyes went wide. “We do not recommend tampering with condoms,” she said firmly. I turned beet red. It was a hilarious, cringe-worthy reminder that even with the best intentions, communication is everything in marriage.
