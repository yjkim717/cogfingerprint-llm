It’s funny how tech frustrations can steer life choices. Last week, I was all set to build a compact AM5 setup, dreaming of a minimalist desk. But no SATA M.2 support on those mini-ITX boards? Suddenly, I’m eyeing Intel builds instead. It’s a reminder that even in 2023, the smallest details can reshape our plans—and maybe push us toward simpler, more compatible paths, both in tech and in life.
