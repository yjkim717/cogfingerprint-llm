## Stuck in the Branches (and Maybe My Own Life Lately)

Okay, confession time. I’m not usually one for mishaps. I like things planned, organized, predictable. But last weekend…well, last weekend involved a drone, a very tall oak tree, and a hefty dose of panicked flapping. 

I'd finally caved and bought a DJI Mini 3 Pro. I’d been eyeing it for months – the promise of stunning aerial photography felt like the perfect way to document our little adventures. And for a while, it was! Gorgeous shots of the coastline, quirky perspectives on our hikes. I was feeling pretty smug, a budding drone photographer.

Then, I got a little *too* ambitious. Trying to get the perfect shot of a wildflower meadow, I pushed the drone a little too close to the treeline. One gust of wind, a moment of distraction, and suddenly, *thwack*. It was wedged high in the branches, stubbornly refusing to budge.

The frustration was intense. But as I stood there, staring up at the little lost drone, a weird thought popped into my head. Wasn't this a bit of a metaphor for my life lately?  Feeling a little overextended, chasing after the "perfect" image, and getting snagged on things I hadn’t anticipated.

Thankfully, a neighbor with a ladder and a lot of patience rescued my drone. I'm seriously considering a DJI Care Refresh now – lesson learned! But more than that, it was a reminder to breathe, to appreciate the present moment, and maybe, just maybe, to avoid flying too close to the metaphorical trees. 2023 is proving to be a year of unexpected detours, and I'm trying to embrace the climb down, however awkward.



Hope you liked it! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
