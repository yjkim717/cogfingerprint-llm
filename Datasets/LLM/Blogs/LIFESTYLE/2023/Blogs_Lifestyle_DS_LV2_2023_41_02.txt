It’s funny how things change. I was watching old NFL highlights with my dad, and he marveled at how simple the game looked compared to today’s chess match on grass. It got me thinking about my own life—how the "schemes" of work, friendship, and even relaxation have grown infinitely more complex since 2023 began. Are we truly evolving, or just overcomplicating the playbook? Sometimes, I miss the straightforward days, too.
