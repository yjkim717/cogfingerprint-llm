The other day, I read about a researcher wanting to photograph a school lockdown drill to study stress. It hit me—we’re all living our own version of that drill. In 2023, the constant pings from our phones, the pressure to perform, it’s a low-grade, chronic alarm. I’ve started leaving my phone in another room after 7 PM. It’s a small act, but carving out that quiet space feels like reclaiming a piece of my own mind.
