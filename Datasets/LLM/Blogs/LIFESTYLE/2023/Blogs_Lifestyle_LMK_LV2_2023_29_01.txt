As I sip on a latte and work on my UX design project, I find myself craving connection. Striking up a conversation with the barista, I discover we're both kickboxing enthusiasts. Our chat flows effortlessly, and before I know it, they're pulling out tarot cards to read my future. It's moments like these that make me realize the beauty of slowing down in a fast-paced world. As I prep for a design interview, I feel grateful for unexpected conversations that spark creativity and remind me to stay present.
