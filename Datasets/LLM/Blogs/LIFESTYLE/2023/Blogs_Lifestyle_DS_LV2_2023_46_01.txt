It’s funny how a tiny, misplaced lens in my DIY laser project last week became a metaphor for my 2023. I was hunched over this red dot module, utterly stuck—which way does the beam combiner even face? The manual was no help.

In that moment of frustration, I realized something: so much of life feels like this now. We’re all just trying to orient ourselves correctly in a world that’s constantly shifting. We’re our own makers, piecing together happiness, purpose, and connection without a clear guide.

Stepping back, I took a breath. I stopped forcing it and just observed. The right alignment, for the lens and for my mindset, eventually clicked into place. Sometimes the clearest direction comes not from frantic searching, but from a quiet moment of simply paying attention.
