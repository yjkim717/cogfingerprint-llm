Remember that ambitious 2023 resolution to finally organize my digital life? I was convinced the latest AI could conquer my chaotic photo library. I uploaded thousands of images, asking it to sort by year and create albums.

The AI did its best, but the result was a hilarious mess. My 2018 vacation was mixed with screenshots of grocery lists, and my nephew’s birthday photos were tagged as “canine events.” It had all the data, but no real context.

It was a gentle, funny reminder that some things—like the story behind a photo—still need a human touch. My new resolution? To be the curator of my own memories, one messy album at a time.
