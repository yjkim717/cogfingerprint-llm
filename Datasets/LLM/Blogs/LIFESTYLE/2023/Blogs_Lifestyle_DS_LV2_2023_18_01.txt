### The Miles Between Us

The map on our fridge tells a story of distance, with colorful pins marking my sister in Arizona and my brother in Ohio. In 2023, you’d think technology would make this easy, right? But our weekly video chats often felt more like a polite check-in than a real connection for our kids. The cousins were becoming polite strangers.

Then, we got creative. Last month, we all logged on for a "virtual bake-off." Flour flew, laughter echoed through our speakers, and my niece in Phoenix gave my son step-by-step guidance on frosting his lopsided cupcakes. It was messy, chaotic, and absolutely perfect.

It hit me then: it’s not about replicating the big, in-person reunions. It’s about creating these small, shared moments—the inside jokes, the collaborative mess. We’re not just maintaining a family; we’re building a new kind of closeness, one pixelated memory at a time.
