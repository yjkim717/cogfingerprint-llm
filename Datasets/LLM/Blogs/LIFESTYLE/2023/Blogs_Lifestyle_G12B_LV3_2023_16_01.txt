>## The Year I Stopped Forgetting (and How AI Helped Me Do It)

Okay, real talk. As a computer engineering student, I felt like I was constantly battling a frustrating foe: my own brain. Lectures would end, I’d feel like I understood everything… and then, *poof*, it vanished. Concepts I’d spent hours studying would slip through the cracks, leaving me scrambling before exams. Sound familiar?

This year, I decided to fight back. I dove deep into study techniques, and stumbled upon a surprisingly powerful combination. It started with ChatGPT. I realized I could leverage it to generate practice questions – way more than my professors assigned! – targeting specific areas I found tricky. 

Then came the handwritten notes. Something about physically writing down the answers, the diagrams, the explanations, really cemented things in my memory. It felt… intentional. 

Finally, the game changer: Anki. This spaced repetition software is a lifesaver. It intelligently schedules reviews, so I'm only revisiting information when I’m *actually* about to forget it. 

It’s been a journey, adapting this system, but honestly? The difference is night and day. I’m retaining more, understanding deeper, and feeling significantly less panicked. This isn't just about better grades; it's about truly *learning* and feeling confident in my abilities. Maybe this could work for you too?
