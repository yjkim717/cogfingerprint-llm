As I wander through my garden, I'm reminded of the lavender rose that once bloomed there. Its untimely demise left a void, and I'm now on a mission to find its replacement. With so many rose varieties to choose from, I'm excited to explore the world of rose colors and care. Where can I buy a new lavender beauty, and how can I ensure it thrives in 2023?
