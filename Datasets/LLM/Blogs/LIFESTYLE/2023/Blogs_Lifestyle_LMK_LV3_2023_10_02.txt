As I mark another year of sobriety in 2023, I'm reminded that it's not just about putting down the drink, but about picking up a new perspective. Hitting rock bottom was a wake-up call that revealed my relationship with alcohol was rooted in control - or rather, a lack thereof. Recovery has been a journey of self-discovery, teaching me that true freedom lies in embracing vulnerability and letting go of the need to control. It's a daily practice, but one that's given me a life I never thought possible.
