## The Instant Pot & My Expectations

Anyone else ever feel defeated by a kitchen gadget? I tried making chicken and dumplings in my Instant Pot last week, inspired by a Reddit thread, and ended up withâ€¦ soup. My dumplings vanished! It was a humbling reminder that even with fancy tools, sometimes things just don't go as planned. A little messy, a little disappointing, but definitely a story to tell.
