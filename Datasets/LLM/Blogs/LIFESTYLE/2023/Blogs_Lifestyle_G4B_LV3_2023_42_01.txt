**The Silver Ghosts on the Highway**

Okay, let’s be honest – there’s a particular car that’s been bugging me lately. It’s not a flashy sports car, or even a particularly stylish vehicle. It’s the Ford Explorer – and specifically, the sheer *number* of white and silver ones I see on the road. Lately, I’ve been experiencing this weird, unsettling feeling whenever one pulls alongside. 

It’s like a phantom police car, triggering a surge of anxiety. I swear, drivers around me instinctively check their mirrors, and I feel this wave of frustration building.  Is it just me?  It’s a small thing, but this constant misidentification – this ‘silver ghost’ phenomenon – really highlights how our perceptions can sometimes create unnecessary stress.  It makes you wonder about the subtle ways our environment shapes our reactions.
