Last summer, our family of four landed in Delhi, wallets tight but hearts set on adventure. We needed a hotel under $300 a night, close to the sights and the metro—or a driver we could hire for the day. It wasn’t just about saving money; it was about soaking in the city’s pulse without the stress. Finding that perfect spot felt like unlocking a secret: travel isn’t where you stay, but how freely you can explore together.
