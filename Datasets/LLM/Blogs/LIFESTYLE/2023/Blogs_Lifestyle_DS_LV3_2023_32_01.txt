It’s 2023, and I’m navigating city life after moving from a warm, genuine town. Here, "fake nice" is the norm—polite smiles masking passive-aggressive vibes. I’m torn: is this surface-level kindness better than blunt rudeness? In a world craving authenticity, these daily interactions leave me questioning where real connection fits in.
