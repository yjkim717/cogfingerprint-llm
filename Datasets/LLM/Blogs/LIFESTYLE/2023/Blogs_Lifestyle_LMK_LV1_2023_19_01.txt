As I tackle my home renovation in 2023, I'm faced with a pressing question: can I simply mud over old screw holes when rehanging drywall? I've relocated outlets and need to cover the old holes. My concern is whether this DIY fix will hold up over time. I've heard mixed advice from friends and online forums. I'm hoping for a smooth finish that won't crack or crumble. For now, I'll take a deep breath, apply the mud, and wait to see how it all comes together. Fingers crossed it pays off!
