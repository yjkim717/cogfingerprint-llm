As I sat in my dark apartment, surrounded by the remnants of a life that had come to a grinding halt, I couldn't help but wonder how it had all fallen apart so quickly. Just a few months ago, I was thriving in my role at a nonprofit organization in New York, making a difference in my community and feeling fulfilled. But then, my mental health crisis hit, and everything changed.

The pressure to perform, coupled with the stigma surrounding mental illness, made it difficult for me to reach out for help. I stopped showing up to work, and before I knew it, I had missed several days without notice. My employer, understandably, was concerned, but instead of offering support, they started the process of terminating my employment for "job abandonment."

As I navigated the complex web of employment laws in New York, I realized that I wasn't alone. Many people struggling with mental health issues face similar challenges, and the fear of losing their job only exacerbates the problem. The reality is that taking a leave of absence can be a daunting task, especially when you're already feeling overwhelmed.

In 2023, it's shocking that we're still struggling to address the intersection of mental health and employment. Nonprofit organizations, in particular, pride themselves on being supportive and caring, but my experience was a harsh wake-up call. As we move forward, I hope that we can create a more compassionate and understanding work environment, where people feel empowered to prioritize their mental health without fear of reprisal. For me, it's a lesson learned the hard way â€“ prioritizing self-care is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
