## The Unexpected Lesson From Pocket Holes

Okay, so I’ve been diving deep into woodworking lately. Seriously deep. Specifically, pocket holes. Sounds random, right? But I stumbled upon a forum debate about the best way to drill them for joining boards – strength versus hiding the holes. It got me thinking about life, actually.

We often face these "L-shape" decisions, don't we? Do we prioritize the visible, the polished exterior, or the unseen foundation that actually holds things together? Lately, I've been leaning towards the latter. Less striving for perfect Instagram feeds, more focusing on the quiet, sturdy work of nurturing relationships and building genuine skills. Maybe choosing the slightly less obvious path, the one with a few visible "holes," is where the real strength lies. It’s definitely a work in progress, this whole life thing, but I'm feeling pretty solid about it.
