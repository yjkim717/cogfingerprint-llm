## The Great Kitchen Appliance Debate of 2023

Okay, real talk: I'm staring at my rice cooker, then at my Instant Pot, and feeling utterly overwhelmed. Can one appliance *really* do it all? Iâ€™m craving perfectly fluffy rice, but also the ease of pressure cooking and slow simmering. Is the Instant Pot the answer, or am I chasing a kitchen gadget fantasy? Send help (and rice recipes)!
