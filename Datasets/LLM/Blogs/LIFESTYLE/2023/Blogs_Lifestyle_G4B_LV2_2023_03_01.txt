**The Weight of a Blank Screen**

There’s something strangely unsettling about a loading screen, isn’t there? Lately, it’s been staring back at me from my M2 MacBook Air – a frustrating pause while I try to dive into a new Paradox game, Stellaris. It’s a tiny interruption, but it feels… weighty. 

This year, I’ve realized how much of my focus gets snagged on those little delays, those moments of waiting. It’s easy to get caught up in the *doing*, chasing the next task, the next achievement. But sometimes, just *being* with a blank screen, a quiet moment, feels more valuable. It’s a reminder to breathe, to appreciate the space between the pixels.

Would you like me to tweak this or create a different version?
