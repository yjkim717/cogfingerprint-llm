## The Unexpected Lesson in My Curly Perm

Okay, real talk: my perm is…a journey. I got it a few weeks ago, excited for more defined curls, but lately it's been a frizzy, almost straight mess by morning. Seriously frustrating! I’ve been experimenting with everything – different drying techniques, even more Shea Moisture curl cream than I thought humanly possible.

It’s made me realize something bigger than just hair, though. Sometimes, chasing a specific look, a perfect result, can be exhausting. This whole perm saga has been a reminder to embrace the unexpected, the slightly imperfect. Maybe my curls won't always be picture-perfect, and that's okay.  It’s a little chaotic, a little wild, and honestly?  Kind of freeing.  Anyone else dealing with hair (or life!) surprises lately?
