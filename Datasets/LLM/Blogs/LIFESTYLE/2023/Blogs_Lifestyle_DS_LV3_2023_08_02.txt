Last spring, I stared at our guest bathroom’s textured walls, feeling uninspired. The knockdown finish felt dated, but I didn’t want to just slap on another coat of beige. What if, I thought, we leaned into the texture instead of fighting it? Inspired by a love for "Alice in Wonderland," we went bold. A deep teal for the Mad Hatter’s whimsy, with a subtle, hand-painted mural of a winding path. The result? A space that’s not just a room, but a conversation starter—proof that a little courage with paint can transform the familiar into something truly magical.
