>## The Unfinished Web of To-Do Lists

Remember that feeling of finally finishing a big project? Like, *really* finishing it? I had that last week - finally cleared out the garage. Felt amazing! But then, almost instantly, new "crimes" started popping up. Laundry piling up, a leaky faucet I’d been ignoring, that stack of books I swore I’d read… 

It's kind of like that Spider-Man PS4 bug everyone was talking about last year, where crimes would just *vanish* as you got close. You thought you were making progress, but then… poof! More appeared. 

Life feels like that sometimes, doesn't it? You tackle one thing, and a dozen more take its place. Maybe it’s not about eradicating those "crimes," but learning to manage the constant respawn. Deep breaths, right?
