"My husband and I had differing views on expanding our family. He wasn't ready for another child, but I felt otherwise. After some contemplation, I visited my doctor in 2023 and inquired about alternatives. She advised me on how to secretly stop using birth control, effectively 'sabotaging' our family planning. I was torn, knowing this could strain our relationship. The doctor reassured me that it was my body, my choice. I took a deep breath and made the decision, but the potential consequences weighed heavily on my mind, affecting our marital harmony."
