## The Weight of Choices (and Minivans?)

It’s 2023, and suddenly, everything feels…bigger. Not just the kids, but the decisions. We’re staring down the barrel of needing a bigger car – a *family* car. My husband’s been deep in research: Ford Edge, Hyundai Santa Fe, Kia Sorento… the list goes on. It’s more than just horsepower; it’s about safety, space, and the quiet acknowledgement that our little adventures are evolving. Honestly, part of me is even considering a minivan. A *minivan*! It feels like a milestone, doesn't it? A surrender to the beautiful chaos of family life.
