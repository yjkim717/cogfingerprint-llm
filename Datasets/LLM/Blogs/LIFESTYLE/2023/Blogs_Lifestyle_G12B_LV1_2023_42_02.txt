>## The Mount Everest of To-Do Lists

Okay, confession time. I started watching *One Piece* recently. Seriously, I know, I'm late to the party. And I've already heard the whispers, the warnings about the Skypea arc. Apparently, it's *long*. Like, Mount Everest long. 

It got me thinking about my own life, actually. I’ve got this…list. Not just a grocery list, but a list of goals, projects, ambitions. It’s constantly growing, and lately, I’ve felt a little paralyzed by it.  Each item feels monumental, intimidating, like a sprawling island in the sky. 

I keep hearing people say, "Just start *something*!" And I get it.  But the sheer scale of it all can be overwhelming.  Maybe, just maybe, I need to approach things like Luffy and his crew do.  Break down the seemingly impossible into smaller, manageable steps.  Focus on the immediate goal – get to the next island, so to speak. 

Maybe the key isn't conquering the entire mountain at once, but consistently putting one foot in front of the other.  Anyone else ever feel like they're facing a Skypea-sized challenge?
