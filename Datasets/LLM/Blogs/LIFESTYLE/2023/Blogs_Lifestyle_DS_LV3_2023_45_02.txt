Last month, I decided to tackle my home renovation, starting with the floors. I’d heard that Empire Carpet was the go-to for carpet installation over my old vinyl flooring, but I couldn’t help wondering—are they really the only ones who can do it without causing damage? Getting that flooring quote made me reflect: in 2023, it’s all about questioning the norms and finding what truly works for your space and peace of mind.
