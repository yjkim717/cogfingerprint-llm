There’s something deeply personal about the scents we choose—they’re invisible signatures. Last week, I decided to trade my Creed Aventus and MFK Aqua Celestia, two beloved bottles from my collection. It wasn’t just about swapping fragrances; it felt like passing on memories. In 2023, where everything feels fleeting, these small exchanges remind me that our tastes evolve, but the stories behind them linger. What’s in your scent rotation these days?
