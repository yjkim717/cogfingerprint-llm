### My Brief, Queasy Love Affair with the Metaverse

Last year, I finally caved and bought a Quest 2. The hype was inescapable, and the promise of escaping into new worlds from my living room was too alluring. When I first put it on, I was genuinely awestruck. It felt like the future had arrived, right on my face.

That feeling lasted about twenty minutes. Then, the subtle swaying began. My brain and my stomach started a fierce debate about whether I was actually moving, and my stomach lost. The nausea was a constant, unwelcome companion, turning what should have been fun into a test of endurance.

Beyond the physical discomfort, I hit a wall. After the initial "wow" factor of Beat Saber and a few other novelty experiences wore off, I found the library of truly deep, engaging games to be surprisingly sparse. It started to feel less like a revolutionary gaming platform and more like an expensive tech demo. I even looked into PC compatibility to unlock more titles, but that added another layer of cost and complexity I wasn't prepared for.

So now, my headset gathers dust on a shelf. It was a fascinating glimpse into a potential future, but for now, it taught me that not all technological leaps are meant for everyone. Sometimes, the real world is just fine.
