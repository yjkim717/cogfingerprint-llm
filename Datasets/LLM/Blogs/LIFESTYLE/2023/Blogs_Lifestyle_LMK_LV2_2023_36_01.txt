"As I struggled to access my Wyze cam due to 2FA email authentication issues, I realized that security shouldn't come at the cost of convenience. I solved the problem by adding TOTP as a secondary authentication method. This experience made me appreciate the delicate balance between security and ease in our daily lives. It's 2023, and it's time to find harmony between protecting our digital lives and living life to the fullest."
