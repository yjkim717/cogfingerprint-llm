## Beachcombing & Building: A Little Summer Magic

This summer has been all about slowing down, and finding joy in the small things. We’ve been taking regular hikes along the coast, and my little one (almost six!) has become a dedicated sea glass hunter. It’s amazing watching her focus, meticulously searching for those frosted treasures. 

Inspired by our beachcombing adventures, we decided to tackle a simple project: decorating a little plant stand for the patio. Gluing colorful sea glass onto the wood has been surprisingly therapeutic, both for her *and* me! It's a reminder that sometimes, the best memories and the most beautiful creations come from the simplest moments. 2023 feels like a year for embracing that, doesn't it?
