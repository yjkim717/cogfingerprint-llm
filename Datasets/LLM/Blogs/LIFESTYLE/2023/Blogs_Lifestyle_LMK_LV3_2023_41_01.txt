"As I dove back into the Spiderman PS4 game this week, I was frustrated to encounter a recurring glitch - random crimes vanishing into thin air as I approached. It's not just a minor annoyance; it disrupts the immersive experience. It got me thinking, how often do we encounter 'glitches' in our daily lives, where things don't go as planned? Perhaps it's a nudge to adapt and find a new rhythm."
