**Pixels & Code: Finding My Flow in 2023**

Let’s be honest, 2023 feels like a constant juggle. I’ve been diving deep into both programming – building little web dev projects – and surprisingly, video editing. It started as a “what if?” – could I actually blend these seemingly different worlds? 

Turns out, the logic of code resonates with the creative flow of editing. I’m even experimenting with FFmpeg, which feels like unlocking a whole new level of control. It’s less about a grand career plan and more about finding a rhythm, a way to weave these skills together. 

Honestly, it’s a chaotic, beautiful mess, and I wouldn’t trade it.  Anyone else feeling the pull of unexpected passions?
