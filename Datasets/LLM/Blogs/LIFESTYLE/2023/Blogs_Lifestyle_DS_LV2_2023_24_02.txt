### The Hype and The Headache: My Brief Romance with VR

Last Christmas, I finally caved. The buzz around the Meta Quest 2 was inescapable, promising a portal to new worlds from my living room. I unwrapped that sleek white box with the giddy excitement of a kid, convinced 2023 was the year I’d become a virtual reality enthusiast.

The first few days were pure magic. I floated in zero-gravity and marveled at digital landscapes. But the novelty, like a cheap firework, fizzled fast. The library of truly engaging games felt surprisingly shallow, and my PC VR setup was a tangle of cables and technical hiccups.

The real dream-killer, though, was the nausea. That subtle, creeping unease that settles in your stomach after twenty minutes, a constant reminder that my brain and body were at war. The headset now sits on my shelf, a glossy monument to a future that isn’t quite here yet. It taught me a simple lesson: sometimes, the most advanced technology can’t compete with the simple, headache-free joy of just being present in your own world.
