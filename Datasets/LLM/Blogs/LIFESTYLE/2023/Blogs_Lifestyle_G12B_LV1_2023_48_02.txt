## Leveling Up: Sometimes, It's Worth the Points

Okay, so I'm officially in that phase of life where I’m meticulously tracking Kris Miles and debating the value of every single upgrade. It’s a far cry from my backpacking-across-Europe days! I’m planning a trip to Tokyo next spring, and the usual economy ticket looked… well, *usual*. But then I started looking at Premium Economy on Singapore Airlines.

The extra miles felt significant, a real chunk of my accumulated points. But the thought of arriving refreshed, with a little extra legroom and decent food, after a long flight? That's tempting. It feels like a small investment in my overall enjoyment of the trip.

It's a silly thing, really, this obsessive pursuit of comfort points. But maybe it's a reflection of something bigger – a shift in priorities.  Maybe it's about recognizing that sometimes, leveling up a little—in travel, in life—is worth the extra effort. I’m still on the fence, but leaning towards saying yes to a little more luxury this time around.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
