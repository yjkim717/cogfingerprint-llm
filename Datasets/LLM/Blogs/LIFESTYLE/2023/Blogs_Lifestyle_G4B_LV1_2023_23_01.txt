**Finding My Party: More Than Just Dice Rolls**

Okay, so 2023 has been… a year of pivots, honestly. I’ve been feeling this persistent need for connection, and it led me down a surprisingly exciting rabbit hole: Dungeons & Dragons. Specifically, 5th Edition. I’m brand new to the tabletop world, and let me tell you, it’s a beautiful, chaotic thing. 

I’m looking for an online campaign, not just to roll dice and battle monsters, but to actually *hang out* with other people. Seriously, the biggest thing I crave is a good group chat and a shared sense of adventure.  I’m a total newbie, so a patient, welcoming group would be amazing. And, full disclosure, I’m definitely looking for a group that feels genuinely LGBTQ+ friendly – it’s important to me to feel safe and seen. 

It’s funny how a fantasy game can lead you to a desire for real-world connection. Maybe that’s what we all need sometimes: a little bit of escapism *and* a solid group to call our own.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
