"The Guitar That Broke My Harmony"

As I sit here in 2023, reflecting on the chaos of parenting, I'm reminded of the little things that can trigger big emotions. Recently, my son's guitar was lost in transit while being returned to him after a repair. I was devastated. The look on his face when I broke the news still haunts me. The tension it created between us was palpable. We both felt a deep sense of loss - he, the instrument he loved playing; me, the trust he had placed in me. I realized that as a parent, my mistakes can have a ripple effect on our relationship. In that moment, I vowed to be more mindful and make amends. It's funny how a lost guitar can teach you about the harmony you're striving for in your relationships. I'm still working on restoring that harmony, one small step at a time.
