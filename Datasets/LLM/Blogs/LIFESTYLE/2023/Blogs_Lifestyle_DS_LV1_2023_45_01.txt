Weekend trips with our family of four used to mean cramped quarters and endless "are we there yets?" That all changed in 2023 when we found our used Ford Edge. Staying under our $30k budget wasn't easy, but the space and comfort it provides have been priceless. Now, our weekend adventures begin the moment we pull out of the driveway, with room for everyone and everything.
