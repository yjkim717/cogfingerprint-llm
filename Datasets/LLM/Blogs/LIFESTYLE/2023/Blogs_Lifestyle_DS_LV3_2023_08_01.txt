The case felt lighter than I remembered. That should’ve been my first clue.

My son, Leo, had entrusted me with his most prized possession: a sunburst Fender Stratocaster he’d saved for over a year to buy. It wasn't just an instrument; it was the soundtrack to his senior year, the centerpiece of his fledgling band's dreams. He was heading to college in the fall, and the guitar was his anchor. He asked me to store it safely while he was on a weekend trip.

In a whirlwind of tidying the garage for a charity pickup, I saw the case. I assumed, without a second thought, that it was the old, empty one. I placed it on the pile.

The text came hours later. “Mom. The guitar.” My heart didn’t just sink; it shattered. The devastation in his three-word message was a physical blow. The following silence in our house was heavier than any case. My partner looked at me, a mix of pity and frustration in his eyes. “How could you not check?” he’d asked, a question I’ve asked myself a thousand times since.

It was a simple, human mistake. But in 2023, a year already fraught with so much change and goodbyes, it felt catastrophic. It wasn’t about the object, but the trust I’d broken. The bond we’d spent 18 years building felt like it had a crack running straight through it, all because I didn’t take one extra second to feel the weight of what I was holding.
