**The Little Things That Make You Question**

It’s funny how a tiny discrepancy can suddenly make you question *everything*. I was browsing eBay last week, hunting for a new digital micrometer – a Mitutoyo QuantuMike, actually – and found one that seemed perfect. Then I opened the box, and… the data port contacts were missing. 

It’s a ridiculously small thing, I know. But it sparked this weird feeling of unease. It reminded me of that time I bought a vintage watch and discovered a hairline crack – a little imperfection that felt like a betrayal of the initial promise. 

Maybe it’s just me, overly attached to precision. But lately, I’ve been noticing these little ‘off’ moments, and realizing it’s okay to pause and ask, “Is this really what I expected?”  It’s a reminder to value authenticity, even in the smallest details.
