It’s funny, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been obsessing over optimization – like, really obsessing. Just like that Diablo player wanting the *perfect* assassin build. I caught myself spending hours on Wow Head and Icy Veins, comparing spreadsheets and guides.  It’s a weird little habit, this need to fine-tune everything.  But I realized, maybe life is less about finding the absolute best path and more about choosing a build that *feels* right, even if it's not statistically perfect.  Right now, that feels like cozy evenings and imperfectly brewed tea.
