**Pixel & Code: My Unexpected Creative Journey**

It’s 2023, and honestly, my life felt pretty linear for a while – freelance web dev, paycheck, repeat. Then I started tinkering with video editing, specifically using FFmpeg, and something clicked. I realized my programming background – the logic, the problem-solving – actually *fueled* my editing. 

Now I’m exploring ways to blend these skills. It's a weird, exciting career path, leaning into creative tech. It’s less about chasing a grand title and more about building something I genuinely enjoy.  Anyone else finding unexpected overlaps in their work?
