**Leveling Up My Brain: Why I’m Obsessed with Spaced Repetition (and a Little Bit of AI)**

Okay, real talk – 2023 has been… a year of realizing I desperately needed a study overhaul. Let’s just say my final year is proving to be a serious challenge, and my old methods weren’t cutting it. I’ve always struggled with remembering things, and it felt like I was just frantically cramming.

Then I stumbled upon this weird combination of techniques. It started with ChatGPT – I’m using it to basically *translate* complex concepts into simpler notes. But the real game-changer? Anki and spaced repetition. Seriously, it’s like a tiny, digital brain coach. 

It’s not glamorous, I’ll admit. It takes time to build these flashcard decks, but I’m noticing a *huge* difference in how much I actually retain. It’s less about memorizing and more about building connections in my brain.  

I'm still experimenting, but this approach feels way less stressful and actually makes me *excited* about learning.  Anyone else trying to hack their study habits this year? Let me know your secrets!
