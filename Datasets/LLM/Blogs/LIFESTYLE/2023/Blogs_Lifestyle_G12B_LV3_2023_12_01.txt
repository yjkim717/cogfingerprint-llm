## Lost in the Diablo Darkness (and Build Guides!)

Okay, so I dove back into Diablo IV last week. Nostalgia, right? But immediately I was overwhelmed! Assassin class, so many builds… It’s a familiar feeling, actually. Like choosing between the "perfect" productivity system – should I follow Wowhead’s detailed breakdown, or trust Icy Veins' approach? It’s a 2023 dilemma: so much information, so little time! Ultimately, I'm realizing sometimes just *playing* is the best guide. What about you – where do you turn for advice?
