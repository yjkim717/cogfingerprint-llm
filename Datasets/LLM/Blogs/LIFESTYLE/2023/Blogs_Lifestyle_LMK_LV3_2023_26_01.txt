"Getting around Cloudflare's guard: a scraper's tale. As a manga enthusiast, I found myself stuck when trying to automate my reading list updates. Using Puppeteer for webscraping seemed like a great idea, but Cloudflare's Access Denied Error 1020 had other plans. It was like hitting a digital wall. After some digging, I discovered that Cloudflare's security measures are designed to protect websites from bots - a noble cause, but frustrating for legitimate users like me. I eventually found a workaround by tweaking my Puppeteer's settings to make it look more like a human browser. It was a victory, but also a reminder that technology is a double-edged sword. As we rely more on automation in 2023, it's worth considering the fine line between convenience and security. For now, I'll enjoy my automated manga updates, while respecting the digital guardians that keep the web safe."
