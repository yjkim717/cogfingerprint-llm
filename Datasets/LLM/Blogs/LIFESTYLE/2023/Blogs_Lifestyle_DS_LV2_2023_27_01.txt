Remember when I tried to build the perfect social life right after moving to a new city in 2023? I was so focused on hosting big gatherings before I’d even unpacked. It felt forced. Now I realize, just like with a new brand, you can’t rush community. You have to let those genuine connections form naturally, over shared interests and trust. The best circles aren’t built; they grow. Maybe start with being a good neighbor first.
