## Kyiv on My Mind: Weighing Duty and Worry in 2023

Something's been tugging at me lately. A colleague in Warsaw reached out – they're considering a business trip to Kyiv for a construction project. And suddenly, the news headlines, the constant updates… they all feel incredibly close to home. 

It’s a stark reminder of the fragility of normalcy, isn't it? We get so used to our routines, our sense of safety. To even *consider* travel to a place facing such uncertainty… it forces you to confront those anxieties. 

I found myself thinking about the people there, the resilience, the everyday lives continuing amidst so much upheaval. It's a complicated feeling - wanting to support, acknowledging the risks, and ultimately, respecting the decision, whatever it may be. It’s a heavy weight to carry, this awareness.
