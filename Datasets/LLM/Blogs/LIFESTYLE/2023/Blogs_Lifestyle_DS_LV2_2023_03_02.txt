### Finding My Seat at the Table

Walking into my first meeting, the word “alcoholic” felt like a label I had to earn, not just a truth I was learning to speak. My story was messy, tangled with more than just booze. I was terrified that mentioning pills would get me side-eyed, that my pain wasn’t “pure” enough for the room.

I quickly learned it’s not about the specific substance, but the shared feeling of powerlessness. The common ground isn't the brand of our poison, but the ache for a solution. I still identify as an alcoholic because that’s the foundation of my recovery, the language of my healing. But when I share, I talk about the *why*—the emptiness I was trying to fill. That’s the story that truly connects.

In 2023, with addiction evolving, our conversations must too. It’s less about policing our pasts and more about building our future, one honest, relatable story at a time. The most important part of meeting etiquette isn't the words we use, but the empathy we offer when we hear them.
