"As I watched my 5.5-year-old's eyes light up while collecting sea glass on our summer beach trip, I knew I had to create some special memories with them. We spent the next few afternoons crafting simple DIY projects, transforming our treasures into beautiful summer decor. It was a summer of slowing down, connecting, and making memories that will be treasured forever â€“ a testament to the power of simplicity and quality time with loved ones in 2023."
