**Building a Tribe Around Your Shop? It’s More Than Just Likes.**

Launching an e-commerce app in 2023 feels… intense. Everyone’s chasing that viral moment, but I've been thinking a lot about something simpler: genuine connection. My friend, a startup marketer, was wondering if building a real *community* was even possible alongside trying to boost brand association. 

Honestly? I think it’s less about chasing likes and more about fostering a space where people feel seen and valued. A brand that feels like a friend, not just a transaction – that’s where the loyalty truly lies.  It’s a slower path, but a much richer one, don’t you think?
