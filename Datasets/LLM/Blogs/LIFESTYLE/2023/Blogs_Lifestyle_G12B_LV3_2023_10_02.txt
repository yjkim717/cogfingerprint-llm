## The Day I Realized "I Could Quit Anytime" Was a Lie

It's 2023, and we're all about honesty, right? So, let's talk about something a lot of us in recovery have wrestled with: that feeling of control. That little voice whispering, "You could stop drinking whenever you *wanted* to." 

I clung to that belief for a while, convincing myself I wasn't an addict, just someone who enjoyed a few drinks. Then life threw a curveball – a stressful job, a heartbreak – and suddenly, "anytime" felt a lot further away. 

The truth? It’s okay to admit that “anytime” wasn't always true. Recovery isn't about willpower; it’s about shifting your perspective and embracing the support you need. It's about recognizing that sometimes, we need help to reclaim our freedom. And that's a powerful, brave step.
