It’s 2023, and I’ve developed a new kind of road anxiety—one triggered by a simple, everyday sight: the white Ford Explorer. There it is, looming in my rearview mirror, and for a split second, my heart jumps. Is that law enforcement? No, just another SUV driver, completely unaware of the mini panic attack they’ve induced.

I can’t be the only one who tenses up, instinctively checking my speed. It’s the uncanny resemblance to police vehicles that does it. I get it—it’s a popular, practical choice. But every time I see one, I wonder: in a world full of colors and models, could we maybe pick something that doesn’t make fellow drivers flinch? It’s a small change for peace of mind on the road we all share.
