There’s something about waking up in 2023 and hoping my perm will greet me with soft, defined curls—only to find a frizzy, straightened mess staring back. Each morning becomes a quest to coax those waves back to life, armed with water, product, and a little hope. It’s a small ritual, but seeing those curls revitalized feels like a fresh start, a tiny victory in my day.
