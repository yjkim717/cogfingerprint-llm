**That One Time the Walls Breathed: A Moment of Clarity**

Last weekend, I decided to unwind with a slightly stronger spliff than usual. Iâ€™m a casual cannabis user, so I figured it was just a step up. But an hour later, I was frozen on my couch, watching the pattern on my wallpaper gently ripple and pulse. It was a brief, mild visual hallucination, but it sent a jolt of pure panic straight through me. My heart hammered against my ribs, and my mind spiraled into a single, terrifying question: "Is this what the beginning of a mental illness feels like?"

The high eventually faded, but the unease lingered. In 2023, with weed becoming so normalized, we don't talk enough about these intense, unexpected reactions. It wasn't a "bad trip" in the classic sense; it was a stark reminder that my brain has its own unique tolerance and chemistry. That moment of distorted reality became a moment of clarity. It forced me to ask not just if I should avoid weed, but why I was pushing my limits in the first place. Sometimes, the most profound lessons come from the moments you least expect, even if they arrive on a wave of panic.
