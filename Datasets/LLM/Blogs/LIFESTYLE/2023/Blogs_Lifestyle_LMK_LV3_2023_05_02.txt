As I paddled back out to catch another wave, the familiar rush of saltwater and ocean spray washed over me, but so did a wave of self-doubt. It's been 15 years since I last hung loose on a surfboard, and getting back into it hasn't been as smooth as I thought. Dropping in on waves still sends my heart racing - a mix of excitement and fear that I'm not entirely comfortable with. As a beginner surfer again, I'm learning to navigate not just the ocean, but my own apprehensions. Embracing the coastal lifestyle means being willing to confront those fears and push past them. For those who, like me, are rediscovering the thrill of surfing, I say you're not alone. The ocean has a way of staying with you, and with patience and practice, the stoke will return. Here's to riding the waves again, and finding our footing along the way.
