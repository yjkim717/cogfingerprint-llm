"Friday Night Freakout: Was it the Weed or Something More?

Last weekend, I had a pretty wild night with friends. We were hanging out, smoking some cannabis, and having a great time. But as the night wore on, I started to feel a little...off. The room began to spin, and I saw some weird, slug-like creatures crawling on the walls (total creep, by the way - I've always had a major phobia of slugs). I knew it was just my imagination, but it freaked me out nonetheless. I started to panic, and my friends noticed. They reassured me it was just the weed, but I'm not so sure. I've never had a reaction like that before. Is this normal? Can cannabis trigger underlying mental health issues? I'm still shaking my head about it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm curious to know - was it just a bad night, or is there something more going on?"
