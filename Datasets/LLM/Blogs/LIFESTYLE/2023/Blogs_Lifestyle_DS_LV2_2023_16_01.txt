### My Brain’s New Best Friend: An AI Study Buddy

It was mid-2023, and I was drowning in a sea of engineering textbooks. I’d cram for an exam, pass it, and then—poof—the information would vanish from my mind like a Snapchat message. The frustration was real. I felt like I was on a hamster wheel, running hard but getting nowhere.

Then, I decided to team up with an unlikely partner: ChatGPT. My game-changer wasn't just asking it questions, but using it to create the *perfect* study tools. I’d feed it my messy notes and command, “Turn these into concise Q&A flashcards for Anki.”

Suddenly, the magic of spaced repetition took over. Anki, my digital flashcard app, became my personalized coach, strategically resurfacing concepts right before I’d forget them. It wasn't just about memorization anymore; it was about building a knowledge foundation that actually stuck.

This AI-assisted loop—clarify with ChatGPT, reinforce with Anki—has completely rewired my approach to learning. It’s not about working harder, but smarter, and finally feeling like the material is mine to keep.
