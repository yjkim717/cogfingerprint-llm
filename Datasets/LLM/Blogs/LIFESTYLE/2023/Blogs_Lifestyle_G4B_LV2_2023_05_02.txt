**The Salt & The Struggle: Finding My Way Back to the Waves**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How something so deeply ingrained in you can just… vanish. For me, that “something” was surfing. I used to live and breathe it – the rush of a wave, the feeling of gliding, the sheer joy of being out in the ocean. Then, life happened. A long, slow fade away, and suddenly, the board felt foreign. 

This year, I decided to wrestle it back. It wasn’t pretty. I was a complete beginner again, battling a frustrating wave drop-in and feeling utterly lost.  My ocean confidence had taken a serious hit.  But I kept going, seeking out smaller breaks and remembering *why* I loved it in the first place. 

There’s a strange kind of peace in those first tentative paddling sessions, a reminder that sometimes, the best way to grow is to start over. It’s not about being the best; it’s about rediscovering that connection, that feeling of being utterly present and wild.  And honestly? That’s a pretty good feeling to have in 2023.
