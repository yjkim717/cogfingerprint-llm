## The Unexpected Joy of Slowing Down

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re constantly chasing “faster, better, more.” This year, 2023, has been a real lesson in the opposite. I finally unplugged from the relentless scroll and started *doing* things – baking bread, tending a tiny balcony garden, even tinkering with my new CNC machine (seriously, Fusion 360 and the Genmitsu 3020 Pro Max are a rabbit hole!).

It’s been surprisingly satisfying. The slow rise of dough, the tiny sprouts pushing through soil, the meticulous tweaking of feed rates… these things require patience. And in that patience, I've found a quiet joy I wasn't even looking for. Maybe slowing down *is* the upgrade we all need.
