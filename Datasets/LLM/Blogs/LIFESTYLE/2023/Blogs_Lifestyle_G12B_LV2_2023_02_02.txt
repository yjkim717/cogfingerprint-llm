## The Little Things That Make a Big Difference (and Cold Hands!)

Anyone else find that the smallest frustrations can totally derail your flow? Lately, it’s been my bodyboarding. Specifically, my gloves. Sounds silly, right? But wrestling with slippery gloves while trying to duck dive under a wave in near-freezing water? Not exactly zen.

I was chatting with some other boarders, and it turns out, it's a common struggle! It’s a reminder that even in something you love, the little details matter. Finding the right gear, the right technique… it’s all part of the journey. Now, I'm on the hunt for better gloves - wish me luck!
