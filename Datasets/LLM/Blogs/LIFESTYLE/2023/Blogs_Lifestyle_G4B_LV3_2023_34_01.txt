**The Geometry of Frustration**

There’s something deeply frustrating about getting stuck in a design rut, isn’t there? I was wrestling with Fusion 360 last week, trying to model a GoKart suspension – specifically, all those precise curves of round tubing using the pipe tool. It felt like a mental marathon, a constant battle with planes and angles.  

Honestly, it’s a reminder that sometimes the most rewarding creative pursuits demand a hefty dose of patience.  2023 has been full of these little design challenges, pushing me to slow down and appreciate the process, not just the final product.  It's about embracing the frustration, knowing a clean design is on the other side.
