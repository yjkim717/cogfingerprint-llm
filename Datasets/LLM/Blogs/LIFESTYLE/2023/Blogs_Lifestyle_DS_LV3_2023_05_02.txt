The salt spray stung my face as I watched the sets roll in at Huntington Beach, a familiar mix of excitement and nerves bubbling in my chest. It had been two years since my last real session—a wipeout that left me with more than just a bruised ego. But 2023 feels like a year for rebuilding, for chasing the things that once brought joy.

I’d almost forgotten the thrill of spotting a clean wave, the split-second decision to drop in, and that heart-pounding rush as you commit. But fear has a way of lingering, whispering doubts just as you paddle into position. So, I started small—finding the gentler breaks, asking locals for advice, and reminding myself that every surfer has been here, humbled by the ocean.

Slowly, wave by wave, I’m reclaiming my confidence. It’s not about conquering the biggest swell, but about trusting myself again. And honestly? That feeling—of rising with the water beneath you—is worth every moment of doubt.
