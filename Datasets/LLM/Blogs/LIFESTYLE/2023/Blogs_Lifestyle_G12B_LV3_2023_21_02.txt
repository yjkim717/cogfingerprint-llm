## Seeing It to Believe It: My Eagles-Inspired Manifestation Journey

Okay, hear me out. I stumbled upon a fascinating Reddit thread connecting Eagles coach Nick Sirianni's pre-season Super Bowl visualization to the work of Neville Goddard. Apparently, he was *seriously* picturing himself celebrating on that field. And it worked!

It got me thinking about the power of intentionality. Goddard championed the idea that we create our reality through persistent mental imagery. I've started experimenting – pairing visualizations with affirmations, even just listening to inspiring music while I do. It feels a little… out there, maybe? But honestly, if it helped the Eagles, why not give it a shot? Maybe seeing what you want *is* believing it.
