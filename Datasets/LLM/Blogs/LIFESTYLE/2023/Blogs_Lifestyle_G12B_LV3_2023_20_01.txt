## The Tightrope Walk: Mental Health and Our Careers

It’s 2023, and we’re *finally* starting to talk about mental health more openly. But the reality is, navigating a crisis while also trying to maintain a career feels like walking a tightrope. I recently heard a story about a New York nonprofit employee – someone just trying to get support during a tough time – and it really hit home. They’d asked for a leave of absence, even received an initial okay, only to now be facing potential job abandonment charges.

It highlights a scary truth: even with increased awareness, the legal protections for those struggling aren't always clear-cut. It’s a stark reminder that prioritizing our mental well-being shouldn’t feel like a career liability. Let's keep advocating for workplaces that genuinely support their employees, and remember, you're not alone in this struggle.
