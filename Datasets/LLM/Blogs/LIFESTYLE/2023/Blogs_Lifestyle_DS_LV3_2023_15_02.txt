The first time I tried cannabis, I thought I knew what to expect—relaxation, maybe a little euphoria. Instead, I found myself plunged into a disorienting world of fleeting, unsettling hallucinations. Shadows seemed to dance on the walls, and ordinary sounds twisted into whispers that weren’t there. My heart hammered in my chest, and a cold dread washed over me. As an inexperienced user, I had no frame of reference—was this a normal part of a strong high, or was I unraveling?

That brief but intense panic left me shaken. It felt less like recreation and more like a brush with a phobia I never knew I had. In 2023, with cannabis increasingly normalized, we rarely talk about these jarring reactions. My takeaway? It’s a reminder to respect the substance, know your limits, and listen to your body. For some, it’s a gentle escape; for others, like me that day, it’s a stark lesson in caution.
