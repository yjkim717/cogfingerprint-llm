As we gear up for the 2023 election, it's natural to wonder how our friends and family will cast their votes. For those of us who are considering a change from the AKP, a key question is how to persuade AKP supporters to consider alternative parties. It's not about convincing them to abandon their values, but rather to show them that there's a better way forward. By engaging in respectful conversations and sharing our concerns, we can help our loved ones see that a different choice is possible. It's about appealing to ortak akÄ±l - common sense - and showing that our values can be upheld by a different party. As we navigate these discussions, let's prioritize empathy and understanding. By doing so, we can create a more nuanced and informed electorate, and perhaps even inspire a new path forward for our community. Let's approach these conversations with open hearts and minds.
