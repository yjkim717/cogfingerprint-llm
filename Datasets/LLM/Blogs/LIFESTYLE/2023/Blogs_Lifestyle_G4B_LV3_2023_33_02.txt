**The Echo of Habit**

There’s something incredibly poignant about nostalgia, isn’t there? I was recently struck by a memory – a fleeting image of a documentary I watched as a child, featuring a young nun entering a cloistered life. It felt…sacred. I’ve been trying to track it down ever since. 

It’s funny how a single scene from decades ago can hold such power. Maybe it was the quiet dedication, or the promise of a life lived deliberately.  I think we all carry fragments of experiences that shape us, and revisiting those echoes – whether through a documentary or a remembered detail – can be a surprisingly grounding way to reconnect with our own journey in 2023.
