**The Little Things That Matter**

You know those moments where you just *feel* something isn’t quite right? Last week, a friend – a meticulous machinist – excitedly showed off his new Mitutoyo QuantuMike digital micrometer. He was so proud of the tech, until he noticed something unsettling: the data port was completely bare. No pins. 

It sparked a quiet worry – a nagging thought about counterfeits and the importance of verifying quality. It made me think about how easily we can overlook small details in our own lives, chasing bigger things. Sometimes, it’s the little checks, the careful inspections, that reveal the most important truths.  It’s a reminder to slow down and really *see* what’s around us.
