## The Five-Day Hiccup: When Tech Mirrors Life

It's funny how technology can sometimes feel…personal, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a frustrating issue in my home network. My OPNsense firewall, running as a VM on Proxmox, has been randomly locking up every five days. The logs are filled with "arpresolve" errors, and suddenly, no internet for everyone. 

It's a classic tech headache, sure. But it's also got me thinking. Life often feels like that, doesn't it? Like a system that runs smoothly for a while, then suddenly throws a curveball. Maybe it's a project that stalls, a relationship that needs adjusting, or just a general feeling of being "off." 

I'm digging into the Proxmox and OPNsense settings now, troubleshooting and hoping to find a permanent fix. And in the meantime, I'm trying to apply the same patience and methodical approach to the little hiccups in my life. Because sometimes, the best thing you can do is diagnose the problem, reset, and start again. It's a 2023 lesson in resilience, both online and off.
