**The Chaos & Magic of Disney with the Family**

This year, our family trip to Disney World felt less like a vacation and more like a carefully orchestrated dance – and a *lot* of frantic Genie+ reservations! Coordinating Lightning Lanes with five people, each with their own must-do rides, was… intense. But honestly, amidst the screen-tapping and strategic planning, there was this incredible feeling of shared joy. 

Seeing everyone’s faces light up as they finally conquered that lightning-fast ride reminded me that sometimes, the best memories aren't about the perfect itinerary, but about the chaos and magic of being together.
