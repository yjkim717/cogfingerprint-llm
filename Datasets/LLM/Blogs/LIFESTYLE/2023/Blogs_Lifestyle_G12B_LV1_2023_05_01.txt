>## Trading Concrete for Cordyceps: My Unexpected Mushroom Journey

It started with a feeling, a low hum of wanting *more* green in my life. Living in suburban California, surrounded by manicured lawns and predictable stucco, felt… sterile. Then I stumbled upon the idea of growing mushrooms. Not in little kits, but the *real* deal: log cultivation.

Suddenly, my weekends weren't about errands and chores, but scouting for fallen oak and alder. The local arborist became a surprising source of wisdom, and I learned the surprising art of drilling holes and inserting plugs of oyster and lion's mane. 

It’s a slow process, a patient dance with nature. There's no instant gratification, just the quiet anticipation of what might emerge. But already, the act of nurturing these logs, of coaxing life from wood, has brought a profound peace. It’s a tangible connection to something larger than myself, a quiet rebellion against the relentless order of suburbia. Who knew trading concrete for cordyceps could be so… restorative?
