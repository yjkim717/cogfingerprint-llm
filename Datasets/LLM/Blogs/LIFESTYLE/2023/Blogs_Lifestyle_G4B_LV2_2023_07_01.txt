**A Little Rose, A Big Sadness**

It feels strange admitting this, but Iâ€™m genuinely heartbroken. My lavender rose, a gift last spring, justâ€¦ faded. It was my favorite color, a delicate whisper of purple against the green, and watching it succumb to the winter chill was unexpectedly painful.  Iâ€™m realizing how much these little floral moments matter. 

Right now, Iâ€™m researching rose care and dreaming of a fresh start. Any tips for a hopeful flower purchaser?  Let me know in the comments! ðŸ’œ #rose #flowerloss #winter #reflection
