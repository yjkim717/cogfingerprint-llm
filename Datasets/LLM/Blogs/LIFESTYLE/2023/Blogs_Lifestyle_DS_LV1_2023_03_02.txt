### Finding My Seat at the Table

Walking into my first recovery meeting in 2023, I was a bundle of nerves. My problem was pills, not pints, and I worried I wouldn’t belong in a room full of self-proclaimed alcoholics. I’d built my own wall, separating my experience from theirs.

But I quickly learned that the most important word in “Alcoholics Anonymous” isn’t “alcoholics”—it’s “anonymous.” It’s about the shared space, not the specific substance. The core of every story I heard wasn’t the bottle or the pill, but the pain, the isolation, and the desperate hope for a way out.

I found my voice by focusing on that common ground. I say, “I’m [Name], and I’m an alcoholic,” because the problem for me is the “ism,” the addictive thinking, not just the drug. When I share, I talk about the feelings that drove my use, not the chemical details. It’s about the “why,” not the “what.”

This fellowship has taught me that recovery isn’t about drawing lines in the sand. It’s about pulling up a chair, listening, and realizing our struggles with substance abuse are more alike than they are different. My seat at the table was always there; I just had to be brave enough to take it.
