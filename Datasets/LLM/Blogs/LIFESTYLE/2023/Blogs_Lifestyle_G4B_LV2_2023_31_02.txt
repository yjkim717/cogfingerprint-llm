**The Great Rice Debate**

Okay, confession time: I’ve been wrestling with a kitchen dilemma. My trusty rice cooker is getting a little long in the tooth, and the Instant Pot keeps popping up as a potential replacement. But honestly? It’s a bit of a weird fit, isn’t it? It’s amazing for pressure cooking, but… a slow cooker? Not so much. It’s making me question if I *really* need another appliance!  Anyone else in this boat? #kitchenconfessions #riceproblems #2023life
