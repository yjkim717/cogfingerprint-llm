**The Geometry of Getting Things Done**

This fall, I’ve been obsessed with precision – not in a ridiculously fussy way, but in how I approach projects. I’m building a little L-shaped shelf unit for my entryway, and I’m using a Kreg 520 to drill pocket holes. It’s forcing me to really think about angles and how everything connects.  There’s something oddly satisfying about carefully planning each screw placement, a little bit of engineering in a simple task. It’s a reminder that even in a chaotic year, thoughtful execution brings a quiet sense of accomplishment.
