**The Tightrope Walk**

Last week, I had a session that really stayed with me. It involved a client struggling with intense suicidal thoughts, and we were gently navigating the tricky conversation around meaning and self-worth. It’s a tightrope walk, isn’t it? Offering support without pushing solutions, acknowledging the darkness while holding space for a glimmer of hope. 

Sometimes, just being heard – truly *seen* – is the most powerful tool we have. It reminded me that even in the deepest despair, a client can still find a fragile sense of self-worth, a tiny thread connecting them to a reason to keep going. 2023 – still learning, still growing.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (like the safety plan element)?
