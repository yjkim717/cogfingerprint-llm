As a parent in 2023, I've often found myself wondering how to strengthen the bond between my kids and their extended family, particularly their cousins who live far, far away. We regularly catch up with my siblings over video calls, but I yearn for more meaningful connections between the cousins. In today's world, where distance is a common reality, I believe it's essential to nurture family traditions and create new ones that transcend geographical boundaries. From virtual game nights to shared online scrapbooking, I'm exploring innovative ways to foster a sense of togetherness. By doing so, I hope to create lasting memories and a deeper appreciation for their heritage. As I navigate the challenges of long-distance family bonding, I'm reminded that with a little creativity, technology can be a powerful tool in bridging the gaps between loved ones.
