## That Little Hong Kong Number Still Means So Much

It's funny the things you cling to when you move across the world. I'm currently wrestling with keeping my old Hong Kong number alive, a SmarTone prepaid SIM, actually. Living in the US, it feels a little silly, topping it up remotely. 

But that number? It's a tiny thread connecting me to friends, to memories of bustling markets and late-night chats. It’s a tangible reminder of a life lived elsewhere. It's more than just a phone number; it’s a little piece of home I'm determined to hold onto, even if it’s just for the occasional SMS. Anyone else keep a piece of their past close like this?
