It all started with that familiar chill in the air and a closet full of winter clothes I no longer needed. My mission was simple: ship them to my cousin. I figured a quick trip to the post office would suffice.

Oh, how wrong I was. After wrestling two bulky bags to the counter, I was met with a firm shake of the head. “Size restrictions,” the clerk said, pointing to a chart. My heart sank. The quote for a special delivery was astronomical.

Defeated, I searched online for a “private consigner,” hoping for a miracle. I found one, skeptical but desperate. To my astonishment, they offered a simple, cheap delivery solution. For just 1,000 rupees, my problem vanished. It was a 2023 reminder that sometimes, the official route isn't the only path—and the simplest solutions are often just a quick search away.
