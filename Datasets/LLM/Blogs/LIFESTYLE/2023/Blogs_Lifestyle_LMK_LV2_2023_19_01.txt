Relocating outlets and rehanging drywall panels taught me patience and attention to detail. I wondered, will mudding old screw holes be enough to achieve a seamless finish? My journey showed me that with the right techniques and mindset, even the most mundane tasks can become opportunities for growth and a sense of accomplishment.
