There’s something about 2023 that’s made me crave the simple joys—like that moment at a laid-back gathering when a friend handed me a glass of flavored whiskey and said, “Trust me, just sip it.” I did, and wow—it was like liquid cookie dough: sweet, nostalgic, and utterly uncomplicated. No pretense, no fuss. It’s become my go-to for cozy nights in or mixing into something fun when friends are over. In a year where everything felt rushed and overthought, this whiskey is a sweet little reminder to slow down and savor life’s small pleasures. Sometimes, the best moments are the ones that taste like dessert and feel like coming home.
