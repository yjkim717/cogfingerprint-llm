## The Ghosts of Summer: Keeping Family Close When Miles Keep Us Apart

It’s September, and that familiar ache of summer ending is hitting me hard. Not just because of the fading sunshine, but because it always reminds me of the bittersweet feeling of family time…and the inevitable drift that follows. This year, that drift feels particularly poignant. My niece and nephew, my sister’s kids, spent July with us, a whirlwind of laughter, board games, and building forts in the living room. Now, they’re back across the country.

It got me thinking: how *do* we truly nurture those vital sibling relationships and extended family connections when life scatters us? Video calls are great, of course, but they’re not the same as shared experiences. I'm brainstorming ways to bridge that gap – virtual movie nights, collaborative online games, even sending little care packages with inside jokes.

It's a conscious effort, a little bit of intentional magic to combat the distance. Because those summer memories, those easy laughs…they shouldn’t just be ghosts of the past. They should be the foundation for a future filled with connection, no matter how many miles separate us. What are *your* go-to strategies for keeping family close?
