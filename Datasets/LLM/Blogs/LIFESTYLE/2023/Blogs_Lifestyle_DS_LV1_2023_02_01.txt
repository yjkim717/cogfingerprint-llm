### The Beautiful, Messy Math of Our Trilingual Home

It’s 2023, and our family’s dinner table sounds like a miniature United Nations. My husband chats in Spanish, I reply in English, and our six-year-old son, Leo, often throws in a German phrase he picked up from his cartoons. We’ve been committed to the OPOL (One Person, One Language) approach since he was born, and for the most part, it’s been a beautiful, organic success.

But this year, with first grade, came a new variable: homework. Suddenly, math problems in Spanish were causing tears. How do you explain "carrying the one" in a language you don't use for equations? We had to get creative, designating "homework language" as Spanish but allowing whispers of English for those tricky concepts. It’s not a perfect system, but it’s ours.

Now, we’re flirting with a fourth language, and I’m reminded that raising a multilingual child isn’t a straight line. It’s a messy, beautiful equation of patience, adaptation, and a whole lot of love, one conjugated verb at a time.
