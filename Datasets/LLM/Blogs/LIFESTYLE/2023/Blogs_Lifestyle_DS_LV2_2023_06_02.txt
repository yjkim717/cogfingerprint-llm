Let’s be real—2023 has been a year of seeking comfort in small things. Between endless notifications and the pressure to always be “on,” I’ve started to appreciate slowing down. That’s how I found myself trying a flavored whiskey that promised notes of cookie dough.

I poured a little into a glass after a long Tuesday, skeptical but curious. The first sip? Pure nostalgia. It was sweet, smooth, and yes—it tasted like sneaking spoonfuls of raw cookie dough as a kid. No fancy cocktail shaker needed; it’s perfect for solo sipping or sharing laughs with friends. In a world that often feels too complicated, this little indulgence is a sweet, simple reminder to pause and savor the moment. Cheers to that.
