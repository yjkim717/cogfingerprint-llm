"Shifting Gears: Finding My Sim Racing Sweet Spot". As a newcomer to the world of sim racing, I was thrilled to get my hands on the Thrustmaster TLCM. But with great gear comes great responsibility - customizing it for optimal performance. I'm on a mission to fine-tune my setup for a more immersive experience in games like iRacing and Assetto Corsa. Through trial and error, I'm learning that the perfect setup is a personal journey. By sharing my customization adventures, I hope to help fellow sim racers find their own sweet spot in 2023.
