As I sit here sipping my morning coffee, I'm reminded of the countless hours my friends and I spent brainstorming our online magazine idea. We're passionate about lifestyle blogging and self-publishing, but we're stuck on one thing - finding the perfect layout tool. Canva's been our go-to, but we're craving more. In 2023, it's surprising how hard it is to find a platform that offers flexibility and creativity. Have you ever felt like you're outgrowing your tools? We're on a mission to discover the perfect fit. Join me as we explore the world of online magazine publishing and share our journey.
