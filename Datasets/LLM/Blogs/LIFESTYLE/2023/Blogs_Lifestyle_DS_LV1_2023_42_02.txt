I’ll admit, I’m a little intimidated. After months of binging *One Piece*, I’ve finally sailed into the infamous Skypea arc. My social media feeds are full of veteran fans calling it a slog—too long, too disconnected from the main story. It’s 2023, and my watchlist is already a mile long; the last thing I want is to get stuck. But I’m trying to apply a life lesson here: you can’t let popular opinion completely dictate your journey. Sometimes you just have to power through the noise and form your own. So, I’m taking a deep breath, trusting the process, and setting sail for the white sea. Wish me luck
