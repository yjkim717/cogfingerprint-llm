## The Tree and the Tiny Drone: A Lesson in Humility (and DJI Care Refresh)

Okay, so I’m officially a drone owner. I dove headfirst into the world of aerial photography this summer, snagging a DJI Mini 3 Pro, and for a while, it was pure magic. Stunning landscapes, unique perspectives – I was loving it. Then, last week, reality hit. Hard.

I was filming a local park, trying to get a beautiful shot of the autumn foliage, when disaster struck. A gust of wind, a moment of distraction, and suddenly my little Mini 3 Pro was hopelessly tangled in the branches of a towering oak. Just…stuck. 

The initial panic was real. I’m not going to lie, I spent a good ten minutes muttering to myself and cautiously poking at the branches with a long stick. It felt incredibly foolish, this adult man trying to rescue a drone from a tree.

Thankfully, I’d invested in DJI Care Refresh. It’s a bit of a pricey add-on, I know, but the thought of replacing this thing outright was even pricier. So, I’ve filed a claim, and now I’m waiting.

This whole experience has been a surprisingly good reminder. It's a humbling lesson in respecting the elements and paying attention – both to your surroundings *and* to the little gadgets we get so attached to.  It also solidified that sometimes, even the best technology can’t overcome a bit of bad luck (and a strong wind). Now, to patiently await the return of my aerial eye!
