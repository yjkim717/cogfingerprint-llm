## That Frustrating Feeling When Your Momentum Just...Stops

Anyone else ever feel like life is just *slightly* glitching? You know, like you’re building up to something, a task, a goal, a moment – and then *poof*, it vanishes? Lately, I've been thinking about this a lot, spurred on by a maddening bug in Spider-Man PS4 where random crimes just disappear as you swing towards them. Seriously! 

It's oddly relatable, isn’t it? We get that drive, that energy, but sometimes opportunities or even just the will to pursue them just…fade. It’s frustrating. I’m trying to remember that even when the "crime" disappears, there's always another one waiting around the corner. Gotta keep swinging!
