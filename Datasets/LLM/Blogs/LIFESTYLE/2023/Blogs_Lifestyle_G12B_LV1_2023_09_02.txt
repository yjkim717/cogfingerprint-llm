## The Curious Case of Danniel and Elanor

It’s 2023, and names are… interesting, right? I overheard a conversation the other day about a couple choosing "Danniel" and "Elanor" for their twins. While I appreciate originality, I couldn’t help but wonder about the constant corrections! Will these kids spend their lives explaining their names? It got me thinking about the balance between unique choices and the everyday practicality of, well, just being called something easily spelled. Food for thought!
