**The Endless Scroll & the Missing Piece**

It’s 2023, and I’m drowning in tabs. Seriously, my browser is a chaotic landscape of projects, notes, and half-formed ideas. I’m trying to build a little side hustle, adding features to an existing website, but it feels… frustrating. 

It’s like I’m staring at a massive codebase, desperately trying to remember the *why* behind every line.  I keep hearing about these “large language models” that *should* help, but it feels like they’re missing the bigger picture – the actual context.  Maybe the future isn't about endless scrolling, but about finding tools that truly understand what I'm trying to build.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different version with a slightly altered focus?
