### The GY6 in My Garage: A Lesson in Letting Go

There’s a 150cc scooter engine sitting on a bench in my garage, and it’s teaching me more about life than any self-help book I read in 2023. It’s a GY6, the workhorse of the scooter world, and lately, it’s been my personal nemesis.

The problem is a mystery. At full throttle, it sputters and pops, a jarring misfire that screams “something is wrong!” I’ve tried everything the forums suggest. I’ve adjusted the valves to a perfect, whisper-thin clearance. I’ve swapped out coils and plugs, chasing a ghost in the machine. I’ve even wondered if it’s just hitting a rev limiter, a built-in boundary it refuses to cross.

And that’s when it hit me. This engine is a metaphor for my own burnout last year. I was running wide open, pedal to the metal, convinced that with just one more adjustment—a new productivity app, a stricter schedule—I could power through the sputters. But the misfires were my body and mind’s way of saying, “Enough.”

Sometimes, the problem isn’t a single, fixable part. Sometimes, the entire system is just asking for a gentler pace. I’m not sure if I’ll ever fully “fix” that engine, but it fixed my perspective. Now, I’m learning to cruise, not just redline. And honestly? The ride is much smoother.
