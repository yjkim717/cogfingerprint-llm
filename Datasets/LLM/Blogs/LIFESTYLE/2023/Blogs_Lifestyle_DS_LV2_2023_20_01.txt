### The Silence That Almost Cost Me Everything

It was the Monday I couldn’t get out of bed. Not the “I’m tired” kind, but the “my own thoughts feel like quicksand” kind. My phone buzzed with work emails, each vibration a stab of guilt. I needed a break, a real one, but the fear was louder: *What will they think? Will I be seen as unreliable?*

So, I did the worst thing possible. I went silent. I called in sick for a few days, then… nothing. I was drowning in a private mental health crisis, terrified that asking for an official leave of absence would be a career-ending move. I was one unread email away from being labeled a “job abandonment” case.

Looking back from 2023, I see how dangerously wrong I was. I learned—the hard way—that employment laws often have protections for exactly this situation. My silence wasn’t strength; it was a risk. Reaching out to my manager and HR, though terrifying, was my lifeline. It led to a proper, protected leave. The system isn't perfect, but it can't help you if you don't speak up. Your well-being is never worth abandoning for a job.
