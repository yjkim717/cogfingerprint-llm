It’s funny how a scent can feel like a piece of your identity. Last week, I decided to trade my Creed Aventus and MFK Aqua Celestia—two fragrances that defined my 2023. Letting them go wasn't just about swapping bottles; it felt like releasing chapters of my life. In a world of fleeting trends, these scents were my anchors. Now, I’m excited to see what new stories and memories the next fragrance will bring into my world.
