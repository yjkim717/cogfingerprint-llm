As I sit here in 2023, reflecting on my tech adventures, I'm reminded of the frustration I faced with my OPNsense VM on Proxmox. It would become unresponsive every 5 days, leaving me scrambling to troubleshoot. The logs revealed a pattern of arpresolve errors, which led me down a rabbit hole of NIC passthrough configurations and network debugging. It was a maddening cycle, but I finally isolated the issue. Now, I'm left pondering the parallels between my tech struggles and life's own unresponsive moments. Just as a single misconfigured NIC can bring my network to its knees, a single unresolved issue can weigh me down. This experience has taught me the importance of tackling problems head-on, and being proactive in maintaining my digital and mental well-being. By doing so, I'm finding a sense of freedom and clarity in both my tech and life.
