There’s something grounding about stepping into my California backyard, hands resting on a stack of freshly cut logs. I’ve always loved gardening, but this year, I’m diving into mushroom cultivation—a quiet, low-maintenance project that feels just right. Sourcing these logs locally felt like a small victory, a connection to my suburban landscape. I can already picture the gourmet mushrooms emerging, a humble yet magical reward for patience. It’s not just gardening; it’s a gentle rhythm in a busy world.
