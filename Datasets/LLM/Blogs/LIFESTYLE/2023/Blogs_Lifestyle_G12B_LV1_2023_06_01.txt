## The Pressure's On: Finding My Own "Trivet" in Life

It's funny the things that spark a bigger thought. Lately, I've been obsessing over Instant Pot chicken breasts – specifically, should you submerge them in broth or gently rest them on a trivet? Seems silly, right? But it got me thinking about how we approach challenges in life.

Do we dive headfirst, fully immersed in the pressure, hoping for a quick release and a fast result? Or do we create a little space, a "trivet" of sorts, allowing things to simmer at a more manageable pace?

I've spent years swimming in the deep end, tackling everything at once. It often led to burnout and less-than-ideal outcomes. This Instant Pot chicken debate feels like a metaphor. Maybe a little distance, a little breathing room, allows for more tender, thoughtful growth. 

2023 has been about consciously building my own trivet – setting boundaries, prioritizing self-care, and accepting that sometimes, a slower simmer yields the most delicious results. It’s a work in progress, but I’m feeling a whole lot less pressure these days.
