It’s 2023, and my Instant Pot is my trusty kitchen sidekick—but I still wrestle with the details. Take chicken breasts: should they rest on the trivet, or get fully submerged? I’ve tried both, and honestly, it’s a texture game-changer. Submerging them keeps things juicier, but that trivet method? It’s surprisingly tender too. In the end, it’s all about that perfect cooking time. Funny how such a small choice can turn a simple dinner into something you’re genuinely proud of.
