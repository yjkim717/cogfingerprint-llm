As I dove into the world of One Piece, I couldn't help but feel apprehensive about the upcoming Skypea arc. I'd heard whispers from fellow fans, warning me of the wild ride that awaited. Their mixed feedback left me wondering: was I in for a thrilling adventure or a disjointed mess? As I navigated this anime obsession, I realized that it's not just about the story - it's about the community and our shared experiences. In 2023, even our entertainment is shaped by the voices of those around us.
