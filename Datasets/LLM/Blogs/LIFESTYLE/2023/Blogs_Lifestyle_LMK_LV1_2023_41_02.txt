As I watch modern NFL games, I'm struck by the complexity of today's offenses and defenses. I wonder if legends like Joe Namath can fully grasp the intricacies of the game now. Back in his day, it was all about raw talent and instinct. Fast forward to 2023, and it's a chess match with endless schemes and analytics. Do old-school greats like Namath still get it, or is it a whole new ball game?
