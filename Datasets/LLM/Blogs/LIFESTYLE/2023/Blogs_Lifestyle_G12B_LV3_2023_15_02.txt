## When the World Got a Little *Too* Real: A Cannabis Reflection

Okay, so I need to get this off my chest. It's 2023, and cannabis is… well, it's a lot more normalized than it used to be. And for many, including myself, it’s a way to relax, unwind, and sometimes, explore creativity. But recently, I had an experience that really made me pause and reconsider things.

It started like any other chill evening. I’d had a particularly stressful week dealing with a creeping phobia I’m trying to manage, and I thought a little cannabis would help ease the anxiety. I ended up consuming a bit more than I usually do, and the walk home became… weird.

Suddenly, the streetlights seemed to pulse with an unnatural glow. Shadows danced in ways they shouldn't. Everything felt slightly… off. It wasn’t terrifying, exactly, but disorienting. I definitely experienced some mild hallucinations – nothing dramatic, but enough to make my heart race and a wave of panic wash over me.

It was a jarring reminder that even something seemingly innocuous can have unpredictable effects. I spent the rest of the night questioning whether this was a “normal” reaction, or a sign that I need to be more cautious. It certainly didn’t help my anxiety!

I'm not here to preach about avoiding cannabis altogether. But this experience has prompted some serious reflection. Dosage, individual sensitivities, and mental state – they all play a crucial role. I'm definitely going to be more mindful moving forward, and maybe dial things back a notch. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
