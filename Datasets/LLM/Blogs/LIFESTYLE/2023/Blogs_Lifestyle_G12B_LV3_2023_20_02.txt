## The Weight of Drills: A Photographer's Quest & Our Shared Childhoods

It's December 2023, and I'm embarking on a project that feels surprisingly heavy. I’m a photographer, and I'm working on a piece exploring the lingering impact of childhood stress – specifically, the anxiety triggered by school lockdown drills. 

I’m searching for a school willing to allow me to document a drill in January, hoping to visually represent the quiet tension these exercises create. It’s a request I understand is sensitive, and it’s sparked a lot of reflection on my own childhood memories of similar drills. Do you remember the feeling? That unsettling quiet, the hushed whispers, the weight of "what if?" 

I’m reaching out to teachers, hoping they might have leads. But more than that, I'm curious: how did these drills shape *your* childhood?
