>## Delhi with the Crew: Finding Family Fun (and a Good Night's Sleep!)

Okay, so December’s looming, and the fam’s finally decided on Delhi for our annual getaway! Three days, four of us, and the mission: explore the incredible history and vibrant culture without completely emptying the bank. Our budget? Around $300 a night for accommodation – a decent chunk, but we want comfort and, crucially, convenience. 

The biggest challenge? Finding a hotel that ticks all the boxes. We’re not looking for sprawling luxury, but somewhere central, ideally with easy metro access. Navigating Delhi with two kids can be… an adventure! So, a good location is key to maximizing our sightseeing time. Any Delhi hotel heroes out there with recommendations? Drop them in the comments – we’re officially on the hunt! It's all about making memories, fueled by delicious food and comfortable beds!
