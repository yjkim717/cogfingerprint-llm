Is it just me, or does 2023 feel like we’re all standing at a career crossroads with a fog machine running full blast? I’m 24, working in sales, and lately, I’ve been daydreaming about trading my spreadsheets for code—maybe diving into React, building something real. But then I scroll through my feed, and it’s all AI this, automation that. Will software engineering even be a thing by the time I get good at it?

It’s not just about jobs; it’s about purpose. I want to create, not just convince. Yet that little voice whispers, “What if you’re too late?” But here’s what I’m realizing: maybe the goal isn’t to outrun the robots, but to learn how to dance with them. After all, didn’t people once fear calculators would make us forget math?

So I’m taking a deep breath and signing up for that intro course. Because in a world changing this fast, the biggest risk might be standing still.
