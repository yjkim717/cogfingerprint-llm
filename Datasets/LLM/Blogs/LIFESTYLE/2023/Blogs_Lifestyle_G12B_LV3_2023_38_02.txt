>## The Unexpected Lesson in Sending Warmth (and a Package) from Delhi

Okay, so I needed to send a box of winter clothes home to my parents this year. Sounds simple, right? Living in Delhi in late 2023, you’d think sending a 10kg package wouldn’t be a monumental task. I initially went to the post office, picturing a quick drop-off and done. Let's just say, the reality was… less streamlined. Endless queues, confusing paperwork, and a hefty price tag left me feeling utterly defeated.

It really made me pause. Here I am, navigating a vibrant, bustling city, and something as basic as shipping felt like an obstacle course. Eventually, I bit the bullet and opted for a private consigner – a bit pricier, yes, but infinitely more reliable. 

It's a small thing, but it highlighted how even the simplest tasks can throw curveballs. And sometimes, the path to sending a little warmth across the miles requires a bit more resourcefulness than you initially expect. Hoping my parents enjoy the cozy sweaters!
