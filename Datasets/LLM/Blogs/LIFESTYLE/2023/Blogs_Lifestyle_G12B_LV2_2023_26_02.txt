## The Morning Mirror & the Great Curl Rescue

Anyone else have those mornings where you look in the mirror and question *everything*? Lately, mine have involved a particularly dramatic showdown with my perm. It’s been looking…sad. Frizzy, almost straight, a far cry from the bouncy curls I envisioned. 

I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day where someone was experiencing the same thing, and it was so validating! It's a little reminder that even the best-laid hair plans (or life plans, really) sometimes need a refresh. I’m diving into some Shea Moisture curl creams, hoping to bring those curls back to life. Wish me luck – and tell me, what’s *your* morning mirror struggle?
