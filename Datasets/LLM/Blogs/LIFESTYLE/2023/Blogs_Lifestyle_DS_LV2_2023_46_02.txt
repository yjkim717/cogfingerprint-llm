There’s something about trusting your gut, isn’t there? Last month, I decided to treat myself to a fancy digital micrometer for my home workshop—a Mitutoyo, the gold standard. Found what looked like a steal on eBay and clicked “buy” with that little thrill of anticipation.

But when it arrived, something felt off. The data port, a feature I was excited to use, had missing pins compared to my friend’s genuine model. My heart sank. In 2023, when so much of our lives is lived online, it’s a stark reminder that not every deal is what it seems. That moment of doubt taught me to slow down, trust my instincts, and appreciate the real value in authenticity—not just in tools, but in life. Sometimes, the smallest details reveal the biggest truths.
