It’s funny how often we box ourselves in, isn’t it? Just last week, I was talking to a friend—a sharp salesperson who dabbles in coding—who asked me, "Can I really start a robotics business without being an engineer?" It hit home.

In 2023, it feels like every passion needs a PhD. But I’ve realized the biggest barrier isn’t always knowledge; it’s the courage to bridge that gap. We get so caught up in what we don’t know that we forget what we bring to the table: fresh perspectives, hustle, and heart.

Maybe the secret isn’t having all the answers, but asking the right questions and building a team that fills in the blanks. After all, isn’t that what living boldly is all about?
