## The Tightrope Walk & Letting Go (A Little Late)

It’s funny how life throws you curveballs, isn’t it? This year, 2023, has been… a lot. For a while, I felt like I was walking a tightrope, juggling a million things – work, relationships, personal goals – all while battling something I didn't fully understand. It wasn't a dramatic, movie-worthy breakdown, but a slow, insidious creep of overwhelm that started impacting everything.

I remember one particularly blurry week where I just… couldn't. The thought of facing emails, meetings, *anything* felt utterly crushing. I verbally told my manager I needed a break, a pause, just a little space to breathe. I genuinely thought that was enough. I envisioned a few days to reset, and then coming back stronger.

Instead, things got complicated. Suddenly, official paperwork and rigid policies were thrown into the mix. It felt like the human element, the acknowledgement of a struggle, was being lost in a maze of HR compliance.

It made me realize how fragile the system can be, and how hard it is to advocate for yourself when things aren’t black and white. It also highlighted the importance of prioritizing your mental wellbeing, even when it feels like the world is expecting you to keep spinning plates.  I’m still navigating things, but I’m learning to value rest, to say “no” more often, and to trust that sometimes, letting go is the strongest thing you can do.
