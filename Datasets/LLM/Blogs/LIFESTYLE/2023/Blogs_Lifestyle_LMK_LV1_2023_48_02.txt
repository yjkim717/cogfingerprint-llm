As I pondered my upcoming trip to Tokyo, I found myself stuck on a crucial decision: should I splurge on Singapore Airlines' premium economy for my West Coast to Tokyo leg? The allure of extra legroom, upgraded amenities, and a more leisurely flight experience was tempting, but the price tag of 32,500 Kris miles per ticket was steep. I've been racking my brain, weighing the benefits against the cost. ANA's premium economy is also an option, but somehow, Singapore's KrisWorld has won me over. As someone who's logged countless miles on award travel, I'm torn between treating myself to a luxurious ride or sticking to my budget-friendly guns. The question remains: is the extra comfort worth the extra miles? For now, I'm still deliberating â€“ but one thing's for sure, Tokyo is calling, and I'm ready to fly in style... or not.
