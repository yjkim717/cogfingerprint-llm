As a developer in 2023, my screen often feels like a digital canvas—one I’m trying to fill with clarity and meaning. Lately, I’ve been exploring ways to visualize ideas, not just code them. I wanted to build something beautiful: a word cloud to capture recurring thoughts, a bar chart to track habits, and a network diagram to map out relationships in my life.

I found myself diving into React libraries, weighing options like visx or mixing specialized tools. But it struck me—this wasn’t just about coding. It was about understanding myself better. Visualizing my routines, connections, and priorities felt like holding up a mirror to my lifestyle. Suddenly, abstract goals became tangible patterns, and I realized how much our daily choices shape the bigger picture. Sometimes, the right library isn’t just a tool; it’s a bridge to seeing life more clearly.
