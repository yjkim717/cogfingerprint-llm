They say everyone has a story, but what happens when the pages of your own are scattered under different names and lost to time? That’s the reality I’ve been facing since early 2023, trying to piece together my VA records.

It started with a simple request for benefits, only to uncover a maze of name discrepancies and missing records from my service days. One file had my nickname, another my full name—like two different people had lived my life. I spent months hitting bureaucratic walls, feeling like a ghost in my own past.

Then I reached out to a VSO, who suggested checking the National Archives. It felt like a long shot, but it was a turning point. Slowly, we began unearthing documents I hadn’t seen in decades, filling gaps I’d thought were lost forever.

This journey has been about more than paperwork—it’s been a process of reclaiming my identity. In a world that moves so fast, there’s something profoundly grounding about reconnecting with the pieces of yourself you thought were gone. It’s taught me that even the most fragmented stories can be made whole again, one document at a time.
