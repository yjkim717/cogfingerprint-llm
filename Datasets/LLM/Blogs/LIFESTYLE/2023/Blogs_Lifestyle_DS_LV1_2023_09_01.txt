### The Quest for a Better Digital Canvas

I spent last weekend wrestling with an online magazine layout, trapped in a maze of rigid text boxes and platform fees that made my creative spirit feel… boxy. I was using a popular design tool, but it just wasn’t flowing. My vision for a clean, personal lifestyle zine was getting lost in a generic template.

It hit me then—this is so much like life in 2023. We’re all trying to tell our unique stories, but we often feel forced into pre-set layouts, both online and off. We crave authenticity but get tangled in the algorithms and expectations.

So, I’ve started a new quest: to find a platform that feels less like a cage and more like a blank page—a place where my words and images can breathe and eventually be shared as a simple PDF, a true piece of me. Because our stories deserve a beautiful home.
