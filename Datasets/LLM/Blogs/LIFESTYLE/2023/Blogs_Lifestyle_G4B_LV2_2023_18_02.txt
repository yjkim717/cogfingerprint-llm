**Collecting Moments, Not Just Sea Glass**

This summer, my five-year-old, Leo, has completely taken a shine to our sea glass collection. It started with a simple hike – a treasure hunt along the coast – and now he’s obsessed with sorting and “displaying” his finds. It’s sparked a wave of ridiculously easy crafts, mostly involving glue and glitter (don’t judge!). 

Honestly, it’s been wonderful. These little projects aren't about perfection; they're about slowing down and creating memories.  It’s funny how a handful of smoothed glass can unlock a whole summer of simple joy, and remind me that sometimes, the best things are the ones we collect with our hearts, not just our hands.
