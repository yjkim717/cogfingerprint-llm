**The Weight of a Frozen Screen**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple loading screen can suddenly feel like a monumental frustration. I’ve been wrestling with it lately – a frustrating loop on my brand new M2 MacBook Air. I was so excited to dive into Paradox Games’ *Stellaris*, imagining sprawling galactic empires and tense diplomatic maneuvers. Instead, I’m staring at a persistent crash, a digital brick wall. 

It’s made me think about how easily we get caught up in the *potential* of new tech, the shiny promise of seamless experiences. But sometimes, the reality is a little…stalling. It’s a reminder that even the most powerful machines can have their quirks, and that a little patience – and maybe a firmware update – is sometimes all you need.  Anyone else feeling the pressure of instant gratification in 2023?
