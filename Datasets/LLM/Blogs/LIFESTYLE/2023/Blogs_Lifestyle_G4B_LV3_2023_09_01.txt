**The Struggle (and Joy!) of Building a Digital Magazine**

2023 has been a year of creative experiments, and I’ve recently dived headfirst into building my own online magazine! It started with a simple desire – to share my thoughts and passions in a more visually engaging way. The biggest hurdle? Finding the *right* platform. 

I’ve been bouncing between Canva’s collaborative features and exploring PDF export options. It’s surprisingly tricky to get a truly flexible layout that feels both professional and inviting.  Honestly, it’s a lot of work, but the potential to build a space where ideas flow freely feels really exciting.  Anyone else tackling a creative project this year?
