**The Weight of the Wave**

There’s something deeply unsettling about returning to a passion you’ve left behind. It’s not just about the physical fitness; it’s a reckoning with yourself. I’ve been spending a lot of time lately watching the ocean, and more specifically, watching surfers – those who seem to effortlessly dance with the waves. 

Recently, I took to the water myself after a nearly two-year hiatus, and let me tell you, dropping into a wave felt… monumental. It wasn’t about the skill, really, but about the lost confidence. It felt like relearning to walk. 

I’m seeking out quiet spots, places where the ocean’s rhythm can gently nudge me back into the flow. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest challenge isn’t the external – the crashing waves – but the internal: trusting yourself to restart, to find that initial surge of belief once more.  It’s a humbling, beautiful process.
