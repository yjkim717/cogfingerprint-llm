As I scrolled through Twitter on my Samsung S23 in 2023, I stumbled upon a disturbing account spewing ISIS propaganda and promoting terrorism. I knew I had to report it, but was frustrated to find that the platform's reporting options didn't quite fit. It made me wonder: are we doing enough to combat hate speech online? I felt a sense of unease, highlighting the need for more effective moderation. It's time for social media platforms to step up and make it easier to flag such content.
