### The Art of Seeing Your Life in Data

It’s funny, 2023 was the year I tried to visualize my life like a data dashboard. Inspired by a developer friend, I started mapping my habits. My screen time became a bloated word cloud, dominated by “News” and “Social.” My weekly moods were a bar chart with “Tired” consistently winning.
