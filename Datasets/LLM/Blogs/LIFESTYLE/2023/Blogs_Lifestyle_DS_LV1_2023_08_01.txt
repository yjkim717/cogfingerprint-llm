### The Case of the Missing Guitar: A Lesson in Listening

It’s funny how a simple, honest mistake can reveal the cracks in a relationship you didn’t even know were there. Just last month, I managed to do the unthinkable. My son, Leo, is an incredible guitarist—his first real gig was just days away. In a classic "mom trying to help" move, I saw what I thought was an empty TSA case by the door and, without a second thought, returned it to our lovely neighbor who’d lent it to us for a trip.

The problem? It wasn’t empty. Leo’s prized electric guitar was snug inside.

The devastation on his face when he realized what had happened is a look I’ll carry with me forever. The frantic calls, the dead-end searches—it was a nightmare. We got the case back, but the guitar was long gone, sold online in a flash. His show was cancelled.

The silence in our house this past month has been heavier than any locked case. It wasn’t just about the guitar; it was about my failure to truly see what was important to him. In 2023, we’re all so busy, but this taught me a brutal lesson: being present means more than just sharing a roof. It means paying attention to the things that are extensions of the people we love. I’m now learning to listen, not just with my ears, but with my eyes. And I’ve started a fund to replace that guitar. It’s a small step, but it’s a start.
