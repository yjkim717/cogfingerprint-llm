**The Weight of Miles & The Echoes of Home**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple phone call can suddenly feel weighted down with longing. Lately, I’ve been really wrestling with the distance between my kids and their grandparents – and the whole sprawling extended family they barely know. We’ve all scattered across the country, chasing dreams and building lives, and it’s left a noticeable gap. 

My oldest is starting to talk about missing “Sunday dinners” and the way his grandpa always told the best stories. It hit me hard – we’re losing those vital threads of family connection.  I’m determined to fight for them. 

This year, I’m focusing on intentionality. Simple things, really: sending photos, scheduling regular video calls, and even researching old family recipes to try and recreate those shared experiences.  It’s about actively building bridges, not just letting time and miles erode the bonds. 

Because honestly, those childhood memories – the silly games, the boisterous laughter, the feeling of being utterly loved – they’re the bedrock of who we are. And preserving that sense of ‘home,’ even when it’s miles away, feels more important than ever in 2023.
