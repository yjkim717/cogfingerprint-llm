**The Weight of a New Start**

There’s something strangely daunting about beginning a new series, right? I felt it recently, a little knot of anxiety tightening as I dove into *One Piece*. I’d heard whispers – legends, really – about the Skypea arc. Apparently, it’s… a lot. 

As an anime fan, I’m always eager to explore, but the stories of viewers abandoning the series entirely because of it really resonated. It’s a valid fear! Sometimes, the anticipation of something amazing can actually make you dread the potential letdown.  It’s a reminder that protecting your joy is just as important as seeking it out.  What new things are you cautiously approaching this year?
