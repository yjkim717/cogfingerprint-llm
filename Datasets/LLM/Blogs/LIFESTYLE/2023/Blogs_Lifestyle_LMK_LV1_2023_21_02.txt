As I sat in front of the TV watching the Super Bowl, I couldn't help but think about the power of visualization. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni's pre-season affirmations had been making the rounds, and I was struck by the idea that his vivid mental images had helped manifest a reality he desired. He envisioned himself on the sideline, coaching his team to victory - and it happened. It got me thinking about the principles of manifestation, particularly the teachings of Neville Goddard. He emphasized the importance of assuming the feeling of already having what you want, rather than just visualizing it. As I reflected on my own life, I realized that I've been using visualization techniques to achieve my goals, from landing my dream job to simply showing up on time. It's amazing how a clear mental picture can shape our reality. What's on your mental vision board for 2023?
