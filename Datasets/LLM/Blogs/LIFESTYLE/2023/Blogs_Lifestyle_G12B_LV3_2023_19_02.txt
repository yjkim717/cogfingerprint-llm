## The Angle of My Projects (and My Life Lately)

Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a woodworking dilemma – pocket holes for an L-shaped joint. Do I prioritize maximum strength, sacrificing hole visibility? Or aim for a cleaner look, potentially weakening the bond? It’s oddly reflective, isn't it? Sometimes, life feels like that too – choosing between a robust, maybe slightly awkward, path versus a smoother one with a little more risk. Decisions, decisions! #woodworking #pocket holes #kregjig #life lessons
