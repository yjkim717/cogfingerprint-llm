## The Silent Strings and the Weight of "What Ifs"

It's funny, isn't it? How grief can latch onto the most unexpected things. This week, it’s a guitar. Not just *any* guitar, though. This was my son’s. His pride and joy. He was finally, after years of practice and dreaming, about to play his first show. A real gig. Butterflies and excitement were practically radiating off him.

Then, a simple misunderstanding. A rushed morning. A misplaced conversation. And suddenly, his guitar – the one that held all his hopes and dreams for that night – was back at the music store.

The devastation was palpable. Not just for him, but for me too. It wasn't about the instrument itself, of course. It was about the shattered anticipation, the feeling of having inadvertently stolen a piece of his joy. It’s been a raw, humbling reminder of how easily things can unravel, even with the best intentions. 

2023 has been a year of learning to navigate unexpected bumps in the road, hasn’t it? And this one felt particularly sharp. We managed to retrieve the guitar, thankfully, but the sting remains. It’s a quiet lesson in letting go of control, offering grace, and understanding that sometimes, even when we try our hardest, things don't go as planned. And that’s okay. It's in those moments, amidst the "what ifs," that we truly learn and grow.
