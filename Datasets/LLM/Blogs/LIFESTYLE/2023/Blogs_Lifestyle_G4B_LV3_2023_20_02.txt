**The Weight of Stillness**

It’s strange, isn’t it? How a quiet moment can suddenly feel…charged? Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the unexpected pressures we carry – the kind that settle deep, like a persistent hum. This research project, observing the impact of stress during a school lockdown, really struck a chord.  The idea of documenting that intense stillness, that almost suspended reality, through photography felt both urgent and profoundly sad.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most powerful stories are found not in chaos, but in the quiet aftermath.
