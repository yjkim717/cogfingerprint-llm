**Lost in Wonderland, Found in My Bathroom**

Honestly, this year has been about finding little pockets of joy, right? I’ve been craving a bit of escapism, and my tiny guest bathroom became the perfect place to indulge. I’d inherited textured walls – a lovely, slightly rough knockdown texture – and decided to lean into a completely whimsical vibe. 

I ended up creating a miniature ‘Alice in Wonderland’ mural, painted in a soothing ‘greige’. It's a silly, unexpected detail, but it’s brought a real sense of calm and a touch of magic to a space that used to feel a little…blah. Sometimes, the smallest changes can make the biggest difference.
