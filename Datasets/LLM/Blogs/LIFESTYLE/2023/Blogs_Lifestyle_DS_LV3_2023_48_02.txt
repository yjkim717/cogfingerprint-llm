It’s 2023, and after years of dreaming, my family and I are finally planning that bucket-list trip from the West Coast to Tokyo. As I dove into the logistics, I found myself deep in the world of frequent flyer miles, staring at a choice that felt deeply personal: should we cash in our hard-earned KrisFlyer miles for Singapore Airlines’ Premium Economy, or play it safe with standard Economy?

It’s more than just a seat; it’s about comfort for my kids on that long-haul flight, and the value of the experiences those miles represent. I’ve been meticulously checking ANA award availability, imagining the difference a little extra legroom and better service could make after a year of saving. Is the upgrade a justifiable luxury or an overindulgence?

This decision mirrors a bigger life question for me—when do we prioritize comfort, and when do we embrace simplicity? As a parent, I want this journey to be as memorable and smooth as the destination itself. Sometimes, the real travel planning isn't about the miles, but the moments they help create.
