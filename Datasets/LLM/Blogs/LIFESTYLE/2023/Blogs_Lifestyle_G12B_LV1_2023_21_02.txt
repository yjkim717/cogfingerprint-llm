## Finding My Focus: Music, Visualization, and a Little Eagles Inspiration

Okay, so I've been diving deep into the whole manifestation thing lately. It feels a little woo-woo to admit, but honestly, I’m all about finding any edge I can get in 2023. Life feels… a lot.

I stumbled across an interesting article about Nick Sirianni, the Eagles coach, and his dedication to visualization. Apparently, he spends a significant amount of time mentally rehearsing plays and outcomes. It got me thinking – could I apply something similar to my own life?

The problem? My imagination isn't exactly bursting with Technicolor movie scenes. I can *think* about wanting something, but vividly picturing it? Not so much. Then it hit me: music. 

I've started creating playlists designed to evoke the *feeling* of what I’m working towards - calm focus for work, joyful energy for a weekend trip. It’s a subtle shift, but pairing these tunes with brief moments of focused thought feels surprisingly powerful. Maybe it’s not full-blown visualization, but it's a start, and hey, if it works for a Super Bowl-bound coach, it’s worth a try, right?
