It’s 2023, and I’m knee-deep in planning our Disney trip with another family—a joyful chaos of coordinating schedules and dreams. The real magic? Trying to sync our Genie+ Lightning Lane reservations so all eight of us can soar through Space Mountain together.

It hit me: this isn’t just about ride reservations; it’s a metaphor for life. Juggling plans, aligning hopes, and sometimes letting go so everyone gets their moment. In the whirl of push notifications and virtual queues, I’m reminded that connection—not just convenience—is the true lightning lane. Here’s to the messy, beautiful dance of making memories, one coordinated click at a time.
