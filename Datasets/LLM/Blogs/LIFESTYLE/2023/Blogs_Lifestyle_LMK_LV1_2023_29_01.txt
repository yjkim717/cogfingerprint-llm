As I sipped on a latte at my favorite coffee shop, I worked on my UX design project. The barista, noticing my focused expression, struck up a conversation. We chatted about everything from kickboxing classes to tarot card readings. It was a refreshing break. I shared some book recommendations, and she introduced me to a new author. In that moment, I realized that even in a busy coffee shop, meaningful connections can be made. It was a reminder to stay present and appreciate the little moments that make life richer.
