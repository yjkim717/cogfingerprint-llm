>## The Quiet Shift: Finding My Feelings (Without the Bottle)

It's funny, isn't it? How for so long, I thought alcohol was my emotional Swiss Army knife. Sad? A glass of wine. Stressed? A cocktail. Anxious about something? You guessed it – another drink. It felt like a shortcut, a way to smooth out the rough edges of life, to quiet the noise. 

But the quiet wasn’t peaceful. It was a dulling, a silencing of something vital. And the edges? They just got sharper, the problems didn't disappear, they just hid behind a haze.

This year, 2023, has been about learning to *feel*. Really feel. It's been a slow, sometimes uncomfortable, process. There's been a lot of unraveling, a lot of facing things I’d been expertly avoiding. But instead of reaching for a drink, I’ve been experimenting. Meditation (still a work in progress, let’s be honest!), early morning walks, and honestly, just talking things through with a therapist have made a world of difference.

It's not always easy. Some days the feelings are big and messy, and the urge to numb them is strong. But I’m learning that feeling them, acknowledging them, *processing* them, is ultimately far more empowering.

What about you? What are your go-to coping mechanisms when life throws a curveball? I'd love to hear your stories and learn from your experiences. Let's navigate this journey together.
