**The Glitch in My Routine**

It’s funny, isn't it? How a game can suddenly feel… unsettling. I’ve been totally lost in Spider-Man PS4 lately, swinging through New York, and it’s usually pure joy. But lately, these random crimes keep disappearing – just *poof* – like a glitch in the system. 

It’s made me think about my own routines. Little things vanishing, leaving me feeling a bit adrift. Maybe it’s a reminder that even the best plans need a little grace, a little acceptance that not everything stays put.  Anyone else feel this way lately?
