As I scrolled through Twitter in 2023, I stumbled upon a disturbing account promoting ISIS. My instinct was to report it, but I was dismayed by the limited reporting options. It's unsettling to think that online platforms, where we share our lives, can also harbor extremist ideologies. This experience made me realize the importance of online safety and the need for social media platforms to prioritize it. We must demand more effective reporting mechanisms to ensure a safer online environment for all users, protecting us from the darker corners of the internet.
