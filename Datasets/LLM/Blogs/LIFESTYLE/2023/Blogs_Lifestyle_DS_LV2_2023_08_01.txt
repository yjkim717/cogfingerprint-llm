### The One Mistake I Can't Take Back

It was just another chaotic Tuesday in 2023. Between school runs and work Zooms, I was on autopilot, clearing clutter. I saw the guitar case by the door and, without a second thought, added it to the pile of returns for the thrift store.

The silence when my son discovered it was gone was more devastating than any scream. I had accidentally given away not just an instrument, but our sacred space. That guitar was the bridge between my world and his. After long days, we’d decompress not with words, but with chords—a musical language all our own.

Now, with his first big show just days away, that bridge is gone. I see the quiet disappointment in his eyes, a wound my hurried "I'm sorry" can't heal. It’s a stark reminder that in the whirlwind of parenting, the most precious things aren’t always loud; sometimes, they’re the quiet bonds we build, so carelessly packed away in a moment.
