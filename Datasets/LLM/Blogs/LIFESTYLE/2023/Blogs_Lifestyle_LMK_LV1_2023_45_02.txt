"As I navigated my 2023 home renovation, I wondered: can I really put carpet over my old vinyl flooring? Empire Carpet was recommended, but was it the only option? After some research, I discovered that while it's possible, it requires careful installation to avoid damage. I ultimately chose a different installer, and the result was stunning. Sometimes, exploring alternatives leads to a better fit - for my home and my wallet."
