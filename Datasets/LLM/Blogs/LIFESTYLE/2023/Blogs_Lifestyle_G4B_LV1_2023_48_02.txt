**Dreaming of Tokyo (and Serious Miles)**

Okay, so 2023 has been… a lot. Between work, family, and just generally trying to keep my head above water, I’ve been craving a serious escape. And a specific escape: Tokyo in December. I’ve been staring at flight prices and, let’s be honest, feeling a little broke. 

Singapore Airlines keeps popping up – their premium economy looks incredible, and the thought of racking up those KrisFlyer miles is seriously tempting. It feels like a huge investment, though. Is it *really* worth it to trade a bit of comfort for points? 

I’m wrestling with it, picturing myself on a quiet flight, sipping something delicious, and landing in Japan. It’s a reminder that sometimes, prioritizing a little bit of joy – and a comfortable journey – is worth the splurge. What are your thoughts on treating yourself to a slightly nicer travel experience?
