>## The Grey Static and the Westminster Skyline

Okay, so I need to preface this by saying I’m not usually one for sharing… well, *this*. But lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the edges of experience, and how easily they can blur. A few weeks ago, I had a… strange evening.

It started innocently enough. A friend brought over some weed, and I figured, why not? It's 2023, it's legal-ish here, and honestly, I've been battling a low-level hum of anxiety for months. I was hoping for a bit of relaxation. 

What I got wasn't quite relaxation. Everything started to… shift. Not in a bad, scary movie way, but in a weird, unsettling one. The streetlights outside my window seemed to pulse with a grey static, and the familiar silhouette of Westminster Abbey took on this almost cartoonish, warped quality. I felt a wave of panic rise, a sudden conviction that something was fundamentally *wrong*. 

It passed quickly, thankfully. A few deep breaths, a glass of water, and the world snapped back into focus. But the feeling lingered. 

I’m not sure I'll be reaching for it again anytime soon. It made me realize how fragile our perception can be, and how easily it can be nudged into territory that feels… off. Maybe my brain just isn’t wired for it. Or maybe I just need to be a lot more mindful of what I'm putting into it.



Hopefully, that fits the prompt!
