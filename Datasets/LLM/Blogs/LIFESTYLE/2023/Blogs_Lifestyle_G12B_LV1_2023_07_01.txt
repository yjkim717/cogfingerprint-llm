## The Ghost of Lavender Blooms

It's funny how a single flower can leave a mark. Last year, I had a lavender rose – not a dusty mauve, but a true, gentle lavender. It felt… calming, somehow. Then, winter came, and it didn't make it. Now, scrolling through Reddit’s rose forums in 2023, I'm searching for a replacement. It’s more than just a rose, really. It's a reminder to appreciate the fleeting beauty of things, and to keep tending to the gardens that bring us peace.
