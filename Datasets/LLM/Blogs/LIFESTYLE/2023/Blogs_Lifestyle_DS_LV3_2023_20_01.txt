It was the Monday my world stopped turning. I sat in my car outside the office, hands gripping the steering wheel, unable to make myself open the door. My mind had become a storm I couldn’t calm—this was my mental health crisis, and I was terrified it would cost me my job.

The fear was paralyzing. Was taking a leave of absence even an option? Would my company see it as job abandonment? In that haze of anxiety, I almost made a catastrophic mistake: suffering in silence until I broke completely. But I didn't. I took a shaky breath and sent an email to HR, initiating one of the hardest conversations of my life.

What I learned in 2023 is that our darkest moments are often gateways to understanding our rights. I discovered legal protections like the FMLA and internal HR policies designed not to punish, but to support. My leave wasn’t a failure; it was a necessary reset. Returning to work felt different because I was different—stronger, armed with knowledge, and no longer willing to sacrifice my well-being for professionalism. Your job shouldn’t cost you your mind, and knowing the rules can be the very thing that saves both.
