## The Curious Case of First Grade Names

Something my friend shared got me thinking. She noticed a trend in her child’s first-grade class – names like Danniel, Elanor, and Flint. While rooted in familiar names, they felt…different. It sparked a little worry (for the kids!), imagining the spelling struggles ahead. Are we, as parents in 2023, getting a little *too* creative? It’s a fun trend, but I wonder about the long-term impact!
