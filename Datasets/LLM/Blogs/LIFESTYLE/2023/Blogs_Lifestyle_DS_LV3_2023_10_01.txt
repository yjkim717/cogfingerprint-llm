It’s 2023, and I’m sitting with a feeling I used to run from. For years, I believed a glass of wine or a strong drink was the fastest way to shift my mood—to smooth the edges of anxiety, frustration, or sadness. Sobriety didn’t just mean removing alcohol from my life; it meant staring directly at the emotions I’d spent so long numbing.

At first, it was terrifying. Without that familiar crutch, feelings would rise up like tidal waves, and I had no idea how to keep from drowning. That’s when I discovered the power of just… sitting. Not fixing, not fleeing—just being present. Meditation became my anchor. In those quiet moments of breath and stillness, I learned that emotions aren’t emergencies. They’re temporary, like weather passing through.

Recovery has been less about “fixing” myself and more about befriending myself. Therapy gave me the language to understand my inner world, and meditation gave me the courage to inhabit it. These days, when discomfort surfaces, I don’t reach for a drink—I reach for my breath. And in that small, conscious pause, I find a strength I never knew was there. It turns out, the only way out is through—and I’m finally walking the path.
