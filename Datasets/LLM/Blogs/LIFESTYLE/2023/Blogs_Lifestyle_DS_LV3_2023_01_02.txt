There’s something deeply personal about the fragrances we choose—they’re like invisible signatures. Last year, I realized my beloved Creed Aventus and MFK Aqua Celestia weren’t resonating with my current chapter. So, I’m exploring a trade, hoping to swap them for a new scent story. It’s not just about bottles; it’s about evolving, finding a fragrance that truly feels like *me* again. Anyone else feel their scent should match their journey?
