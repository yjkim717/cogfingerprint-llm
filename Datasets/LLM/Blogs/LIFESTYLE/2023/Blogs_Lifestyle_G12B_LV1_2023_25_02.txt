>## The Weight of "What's the Point?" (And Finding a Little Spark Anyway)

It's 2023, and I’ve been feeling… heavy. Not in a physical way, but a feeling of just *blah*. Like the wind got sucked out of my sails a while ago and I haven't quite managed to reinflate them. I’ve been wrestling with that classic question: “What's the point?” 

It’s a dangerous place to linger, I know. Lately, I've been consciously trying to inject small moments of joy back into the routine. Baking bread, really *listening* to a podcast, taking a walk just to notice the changing leaves. Tiny things.

It’s not a fix, of course. Big questions don’t vanish with a good loaf of sourdough. But those little sparks? They remind me there's still something beautiful to notice, something worth engaging with, even when the bigger picture feels blurry. And that, for now, is enough.
