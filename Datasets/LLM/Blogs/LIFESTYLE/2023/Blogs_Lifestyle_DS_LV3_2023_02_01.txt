It’s 2023, and our multilingual household is buzzing with life—and homework. My daughter, raised with OPOL (one parent, one language), switches effortlessly between three languages, but math problems? They’re a whole different puzzle.

I used to stress: should we tackle equations in English, or stick to our home languages? Then I realized—it’s not about choosing one over the others. It’s about weaving them together. Now, we count in Spanish, explain concepts in French, and laugh about mistakes in English. It’s messy, but it works.

Lately, she’s curious about Mandarin. A fourth language? My first thought was, “Is this too much?” But watching her eyes light up at new sounds, I’m reminded: language acquisition isn’t a checklist. It’s a living, breathing part of our family’s story—one conversation, one math problem, at a time.
