>## The Frustration of New Tech & Old Dreams

Okay, so I finally caved. I upgraded to an M2 Macbook Air. Shiny, sleek, promised a whole new level of efficiency. And honestly, it *is* lovely. But it’s also been a frustrating lesson in the realities of tech in 2023. 

You see, I'm a massive Stellaris fan. Grand strategy, galaxy-building, the whole shebang. I was so excited to finally play it on my new machine. But… disaster. It crashes. Every. Single. Time. Right around 80% during the loading screen.

It’s a silly thing to be upset about, I know. But it highlights something bigger, doesn't it? We chase these upgrades, these promises of seamless experiences, and sometimes… they just don’t deliver. It’s a reminder that even with all the technological advancements, there's still a layer of complexity, of incompatibility, that can throw a wrench in your plans. 

Now I'm stuck troubleshooting, forums-diving, and desperately hoping Paradox Games releases a fix. Just trying to build a galactic empire, one frustrating loading screen at a time.
