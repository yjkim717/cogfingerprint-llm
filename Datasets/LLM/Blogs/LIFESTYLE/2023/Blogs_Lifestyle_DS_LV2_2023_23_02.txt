### The Map That Led Me Nowhere (And Why That’s Okay)

For most of my life, I operated under a simple assumption: follow the map, and you’ll get where you’re going. My map was a psychology degree, and the destination was a tidy little dot labeled “Stable Office Career.” I pictured myself in a cozy chair, maybe writing reports or, I don’t know, thoughtfully analyzing data. It felt safe. It felt like the right next step.

Then 2023 happened. I landed a job as a technical writer, thinking it was the perfect blend of my skills. But after just a few months, the four walls of my cubicle started to feel less like a shelter and more like a cage. The glow of the screen became a relentless sun, and the hum of the office AC was the soundtrack to a slow-burning existential crisis. I was doing everything the map said, but I was utterly, completely lost.

My breaking point was a bizarre, beautiful moment of clarity. I was on my lunch break, scrolling through job listings for "nature interpreter" and "trail conservationist," when a sponsored ad for a local welding certification course popped up. Welding. The juxtaposition was so absurd it was brilliant. Here I was, a recent psych grad, simultaneously dreaming of pristine forests and the fiery spark of a welding torch.

And that’s when I realized the problem wasn't the destination. It was the map itself.

We’re sold this idea that our career path should be a straight, paved highway. But what if it’s not? What if it’s a messy, overgrown trail with forks you never expected? My journey from academic theories to writing manuals, and now to fantasizing about soil and steel, isn’t a sign of failure. It’s a sign of life. It’s me listening to a quiet, stubborn part of myself that wants to build, to grow, and to get its hands dirty—literally.

I don’t have a new five-year plan. Right now, my plan is to explore. Maybe I’ll love the smell of pine more than the smell of ozone from a welding arc, or vice versa. The uncertainty is terrifying, but for the first time, it’s also thrilling. The map is gone, and I’m finally learning to navigate by the stars.
