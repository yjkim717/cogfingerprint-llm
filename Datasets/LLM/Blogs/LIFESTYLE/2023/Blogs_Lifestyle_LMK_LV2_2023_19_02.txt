As I stepped into my cluttered garage workshop in 2023, I found myself pondering life's little challenges. I was trying to join two 1x12 boards in an L shape using my trusty Kreg 520. The task seemed simple, yet I was stumped on the drilling direction for pocket holes. It struck me that, just like in woodworking, life's toughest decisions often require patience and a fresh perspective. Sometimes, all it takes is a slight adjustment to create something beautiful.
