## The Quiet Loss of a Lavender Rose

It's a small thing, I know, but my lavender rose didn’t make it through the winter. That particular shade – a soft, dusky purple – felt like a little piece of serenity in my garden. Now, I'm on the hunt for a replacement, hoping to recapture that quiet joy. Anyone have a favorite nursery for unusual rose colors? 2023 feels a little brighter with the promise of a new bloom.
