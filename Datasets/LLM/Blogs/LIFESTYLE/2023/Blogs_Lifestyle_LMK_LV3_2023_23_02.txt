**From Brain Science to Green Horizons: My Journey to a More Fulfilling Career**

As I sit here in 2023, reflecting on my career journey so far, I am reminded of the twists and turns that have led me to where I am today. With a BS in neuropsychology under my belt, I initially thought I'd be diving headfirst into a research lab or a clinical setting. Instead, I found myself in a writing and editing role, using my skills to communicate complex ideas to various audiences. While it wasn't a bad fit, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing.

As I approached my 22nd birthday, I began to feel a growing sense of restlessness. The more I worked, the more I felt unfulfilled. It wasn't just about the job itself; it was about the impact I wanted to make in the world. I started exploring alternative fields that aligned with my passion for nature and the environment. The more I read and researched, the more I became convinced that a career change was not just desirable, but necessary.

One of the most surprising areas I've been drawn to is welding. Yes, you read that right – welding! It may seem like an unusual choice for someone with a neuropsychology background, but hear me out. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of art and science, and welding offers a unique blend of creativity and technical skill. Moreover, many welding applications are now focused on sustainability, such as creating eco-friendly infrastructure or repairing equipment in a way that reduces waste.

My journey into nature-based careers has also led me to explore roles in environmental conservation and sustainability. I'm excited about the prospect of using my skills to contribute to a more environmentally conscious future. It's not just about saving the planet; it's about creating a better world for all living beings.

As I navigate this career transition, I'm learning to be kinder to myself and more open to new experiences. I've come to realize that my background in neuropsychology isn't a limitation; it's a foundation upon which I can build a new career. The skills I developed in research and writing are transferable, and my understanding of complex systems can be applied to environmental issues.

If you're considering a career change, I encourage you to take a deep breath and explore your passions. It may lead you down unexpected paths, but the journey itself is worth it. For me, it's about aligning my work with my values and finding a sense of purpose. As I move forward, I'm excited to see where this journey takes me – and I'm grateful for the courage to take the first step.
