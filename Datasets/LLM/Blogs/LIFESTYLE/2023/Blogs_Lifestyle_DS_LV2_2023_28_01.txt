It’s funny how a burned-out DC motor driver on my workbench got me thinking about life in 2023. Sometimes, we push ourselves too hard, ignoring the warning signs until something inside just gives out—like that little 'DE' component I couldn’t even identify. Was it a capacitor holding energy or a broken diode letting things flow the wrong way? Maybe we all need to check our own circuits now and then, before we short out completely.
