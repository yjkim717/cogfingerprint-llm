## When Saying "No" Feels Like Everything

It’s 2023, and we’re *finally* starting to talk about it, aren’t we? Mental health. It’s woven into conversations about wellness, self-care, and even productivity. But sometimes, the reality of it is a lot less Instagram-worthy and a lot more… overwhelming.

Recently, I've been thinking a lot about boundaries. Specifically, the ones we set – or *don’t* set – at work. We’re told to hustle, to be “on,” to prioritize our careers. And I get it. Ambition is valuable. But what happens when the weight of it all becomes too much?

I heard a story recently – a friend working tirelessly for a non-profit, pouring her heart into a cause she deeply believed in, until she simply couldn't anymore. A mental health crisis hit, and suddenly, showing up – *really* showing up – felt impossible.  She verbally requested a leave, a moment to breathe, to heal. And then… complications arose.

It’s a stark reminder that even with increased awareness, navigating mental health in the workplace can be incredibly complex. It made me reflect on my own experiences, the times I’ve pushed myself past my limits, fearing the repercussions of stepping back.

It's a messy, human truth: sometimes, prioritizing your well-being *is* the most productive thing you can do. It’s a lesson I'm still learning, one quiet moment of self-compassion at a time.
