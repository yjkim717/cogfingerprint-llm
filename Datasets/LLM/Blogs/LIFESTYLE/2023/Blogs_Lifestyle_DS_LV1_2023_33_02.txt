It’s funny how certain moments stick with you. Years ago, I stumbled upon a documentary about a young girl choosing to become a cloistered nun. Her quiet conviction on that old Catholic channel stayed with me. In our fast-paced, hyper-connected 2023, I sometimes long for that kind of purposeful silence. It’s a reminder that a meaningful life isn’t about doing more, but about being fully present in what we choose—however simple it may seem.
