## My Hong Kong Connection, Still Ticking

It’s funny the little things that keep you tethered to a place. I moved back to the States a couple of years ago, but I still have a Hong Kong Smarfone number. It started as a practical thing – a prepaid SIM card for my trip. Now, it's become a quiet link to a time and a city I miss. 

I religiously top it up every few months, just enough to keep it active. It's a small expense, really, and the occasional SMS I receive from old friends feels like a little burst of sunshine. It’s a reminder of late-night dim sum and the vibrant energy of Hong Kong, a digital postcard from a life lived elsewhere. It's a comforting, low-key connection.
