Designing my GoKart's suspension in Fusion 360 was a humbling experience. As I juggled multiple components in 3D space, I realized that cad design isn't just about technical skills - it's also about visualization and workflow management. My struggles taught me the importance of breaking down complex projects into manageable chunks and optimizing my workflow. Now, I approach other areas of my life with a similar mindset, simplifying tasks and finding clarity in the chaos. It's amazing how a challenging design project can inspire a more streamlined lifestyle.
