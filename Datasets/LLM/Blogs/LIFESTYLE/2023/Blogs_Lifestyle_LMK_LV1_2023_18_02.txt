"As I watched the sunset on our 2023 summer vacation, I realized that the best memories are made in the simplest ways. My 5.5-year-old and I spent hours collecting sea glass on the beach, and later turned it into beautiful DIY crafts. We hiked, created, and enjoyed quality time together. Those moments of making something with our own hands are truly treasured. It's a reminder to slow down and appreciate the little things in life."
