Living miles away from grandparents and cousins used to feel like a permanent gap in our family story. Then, we got creative with our video chats. It wasn't just about catching up anymore; it became about *doing* things together, even from a distance.

Last Tuesday, for instance, my screen was filled with the faces of my parents and our kids, all with mixing bowls. We were baking the same banana bread recipe simultaneously, 500 miles apart. Flour flew, my dad told a story about his motherâ€™s kitchen, and my niece proudly showed off her "egg-cracking" skills. It was chaotic, messy, and absolutely perfect.

In 2023, long-distance parenting isn't just about maintaining a connection; it's about actively building it. These shared digital experiences, these little moments of co-creation, are the new threads weaving our family tapestry together, proving that distance is no match for a shared batch of cookies and a whole lot of love.
