There’s something humbling about winter surfing—the bite of near-zero water, the clumsy fumbling with gear. Last year, I struggled with slippery gloves that made duck diving a battle. Finding the right pair changed everything: warmth without losing grip, confidence in every wave. It reminded me that sometimes, the smallest adjustments—not just in surfing, but in life—can turn frustration into flow. Winter taught me to embrace the chill, inside and out.
