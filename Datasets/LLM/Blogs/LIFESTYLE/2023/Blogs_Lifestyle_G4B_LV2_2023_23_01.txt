**Finding My Tribe in a Digital Dungeon**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2023 feels like a year of searching, right? Not in a dramatic, *Lost* kind of way, but a quiet, persistent one for finding the right fit. Lately, that search has taken a really unexpected turn – into the wonderfully weird world of Dungeons & Dragons. 

I’ve always been a bit of a solitary gamer, happy with my own stories and characters. But I realized I was craving something more, something *shared*.  And that’s when I stumbled upon the idea of an online D&D campaign. 

Specifically, I’m looking for a group that feels like a genuine community. I'm a relatively new player (5th Edition, if you're curious!), and the thought of diving into a collaborative story is incredibly exciting.  More than just dice rolls and monsters, I really value a group that's open and welcoming – especially one that’s LGBTQ+ friendly. 

It’s funny, building a character feels like creating a little piece of myself, and wanting a group that understands and celebrates that vulnerability.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best adventures aren't found on a map, but in the connections we forge, even in a digital dungeon.  Anyone else feeling that pull towards finding their online tribe?
