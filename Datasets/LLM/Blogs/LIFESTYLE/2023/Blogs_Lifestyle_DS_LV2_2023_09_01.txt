It’s funny how life nudges you toward new passions. Last spring, I found myself craving a creative outlet—something more personal than social media, more tangible than fleeting posts. I wanted to curate my own little world, a digital scrapbook of recipes, poetry, and quiet moments. That’s when I stumbled into the universe of online magazines.

After some trial and error, I landed on Canva. Its layout system felt like arranging photos and thoughts in a cozy journal, and those text boxes? They became my voice. The best part? With a click, I could wrap it all into a PDF—my own little time capsule, ready to share or tuck away.

In 2023, we’re all searching for ways to leave gentle marks on the world. Maybe yours starts with a blank page, too.
