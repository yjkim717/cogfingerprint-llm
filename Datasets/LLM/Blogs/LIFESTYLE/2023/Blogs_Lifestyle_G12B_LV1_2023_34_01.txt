## The Unexpected Geometry of Letting Go

It’s funny how life sometimes mirrors the challenges I face in Fusion 360. Lately, I've been wrestling with designing go-kart suspension parts – specifically, trying to work with pipes and the bizarre planes they create. It's frustrating, a constant battle against the software's logic.

And then it hit me: I’ve been holding onto a lot of things lately, rigid and inflexible, just like trying to force a pipe to behave in a way it doesn't want to. Letting go of those unnecessary burdens, accepting the slightly wonky angles of life, feels surprisingly liberating. Maybe a little creative bending, a willingness to adapt, is the key to both a smooth suspension *and* a smoother 2023.



Hope that works!
