As I was rearranging my living room this weekend, I found myself pondering the age-old question: how do I keep my space stylish while also making sure my heating and cooling system doesn't go into overdrive? Specifically, I was wondering how to place my furniture around those pesky wall vents. I mean, we all know that blocking them can lead to reduced airflow and a less-than-comfy home. But, let's be real, who wants an unsightly vent cover ruining their perfectly curated decor? After some trial and error (and a few Google searches), I discovered that leaving a clearance of at least 6-8 inches around wall vents is key. Now, my sectional sofa and coffee table are arranged just so, and my home is both cozy and energy-efficient. A little planning can go a long way in making our homes both beautiful and functional â€“ a win-win in my book!
