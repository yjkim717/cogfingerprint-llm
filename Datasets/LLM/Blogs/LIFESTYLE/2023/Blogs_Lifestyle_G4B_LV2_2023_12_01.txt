Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt and guidelines:

**The Weight of "Should"**

There’s this persistent little voice in my head this year, constantly whispering “should.” Should I be learning a new skill? Should I be volunteering more? Should I finally declutter this spare room? It’s exhausting. I realized lately that chasing all those “shoulds” isn’t actually making me *feel* good.  Maybe the real goal isn't ticking boxes, but gently exploring what *wants* to happen, instead.  It’s a quiet shift, but a freeing one.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a different blog post based on a new prompt?
