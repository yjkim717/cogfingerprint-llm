**The Weight of the Pixel**

Okay, let’s be real for a second. How many of us scroll through Instagram, TikTok, or even just a quick YouTube search and find ourselves… comparing? Not just to influencers or travel destinations, but to, well, *ourselves* when it comes to sex? 

I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about this lately, and it feels like a pretty common trap. The internet, and particularly pornography, has created this incredibly warped idea of what “normal” sexual performance is. We’re bombarded with images of seemingly endless erections, flawless technique, and a level of intensity that just… isn’t realistic. 

I used to get completely caught up in it. I’d notice a little bit of anxiety before intimacy, obsessing over whether my own… *ahem*… performance would measure up. It was ridiculous, I know. But the constant comparison started to chip away at my enjoyment, and honestly, it was starting to affect my relationships. 

It’s not about demonizing pornography entirely – it's about recognizing its power and the potential for it to create unrealistic expectations. Lately, I’ve been making a conscious effort to shift my focus. Instead of worrying about the ‘perfect’ erection, I'm trying to appreciate the connection, the vulnerability, and the simple pleasure of being with my partner. It’s a slow process, but I’m finding that letting go of the pixelated pressure is actually freeing. 

What are your thoughts?  Do you struggle with similar comparisons?
