**Dreaming of Tokyo (and a Really Nice Seat)**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2023 felt like a year of chasing little pockets of joy, didn’t it? I’ve been doing a *lot* of daydreaming lately, specifically about travel. I stumbled across a conversation online – someone agonizing over whether to splurge on Singapore Airlines Premium Economy for a trip to Tokyo in December. 

It really resonated with me. That feeling of wanting something *extra* for a special trip, you know? I’ve been saving up KrisFlyer miles, picturing myself nestled in a wider seat, maybe even a little meal service upgrade. 

Honestly, it’s not just about the destination. It’s about the *journey*. The anticipation of a long-haul flight, the comfort of a good seat, the feeling of being properly taken care of.  It’s about turning a routine trip into a little luxury.  

Anyone else feeling the pull of a well-planned escape?  Maybe we should start a spreadsheet of dream flights!
