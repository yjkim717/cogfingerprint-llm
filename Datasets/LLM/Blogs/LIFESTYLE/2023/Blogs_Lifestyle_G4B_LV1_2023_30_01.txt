**The Vent Dilemma: Cozy vs. Smart**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with a really annoying little dilemma this fall. You know how you get *so* cozy when it’s freezing outside? I was seriously considering shutting off a few of the floor vents in our living room – just to trap that heat and really crank up the thermostat. I pictured a blissful, warm haven. 

But then I remembered that nagging feeling about our HVAC system. My dad, a retired HVAC tech, kept sending me articles about how closing vents can actually cause damage, throwing off the airflow and stressing the whole unit. 

It’s funny, isn’t it?  We’re so focused on comfort, but sometimes the smartest move is the *least* obvious one. This whole thing has made me think about how much we automatically do for convenience versus how mindful we are of our home’s systems.  Anyone else dealing with this kind of “cozy versus smart” battle in 2023?
