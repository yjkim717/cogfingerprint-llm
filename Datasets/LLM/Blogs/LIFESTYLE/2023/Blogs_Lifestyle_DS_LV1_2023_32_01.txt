Walking through my new neighborhood, I noticed something odd. Nobody made eye contact, yet polite notes appeared on every misparked bike. In 2023, we’re surrounded by this “fake nice” culture—endless smiles masking passive-aggressive undertones. I miss my old town’s genuine warmth. Are we building communities or just managing appearances? It’s made me rethink what real connection means in city life.
