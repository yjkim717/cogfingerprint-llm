Raising a Trilingual Child in a Multilingual World

As a parent in the US, navigating language use at home and school with my trilingual child can be a daily puzzle. How do I help with math homework in a language we're not fluent in at home? How can I ensure our family conversations remain meaningful in our native tongue while my child is learning a third language at school? And, as an added twist, I've been considering introducing a fourth language through online courses. It's a challenge, but it's also a gift â€“ watching my child effortlessly switch between languages and cultures. In 2023, with the world more connected than ever, I'm embracing the complexity of bilingual parenting and language acquisition. By sharing our experiences, I hope to connect with others on this multilingual journey and learn from their stories too.
