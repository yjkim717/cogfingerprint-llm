**The Illusion of Control**

Anyone else feel like sometimes life just… glitches? Like you’re swinging through a perfectly planned day, feeling like you’ve got everything under control, and then *poof* – a random crime (or a demanding work deadline) just disappears, leaving you dangling in the void? I was totally lost in Spider-Man PS4 the other day, and it hit me: it’s similar.  You build this momentum, this sense of progress, only for things to vanish without a trace.  It’s a weird reminder to appreciate the present, and maybe not get so hung up on chasing the next perfect swing.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different style of post?
