**Navigating the Magic (and the Madness!)**

This summer, we’re tackling Disney World with the whole crew – that’s four kids and four friends!  It’s exhilarating, obviously, but let’s be real, the Genie+ and Lightning Lane system feels like a whole other level of strategic planning.  I’m already envisioning the potential for chaos – coordinating everyone’s reservations feels like a mini-project in itself.  It’s a reminder that even the most magical experiences need a little logistical juggling.  Honestly, I’m hoping for more ‘magic’ than ‘madness’ this trip!  Anyone else feeling this overwhelmed?
