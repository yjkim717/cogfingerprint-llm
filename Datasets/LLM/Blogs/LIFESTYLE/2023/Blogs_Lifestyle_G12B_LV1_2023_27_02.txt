## The Unexpected Lesson from Tights (and a Startup's Promise)

Okay, so I fell for the hype. This year, everyone was raving about Bliss Club tights – the sustainable, ethically-made ones. I envisioned effortless chic, a silky smooth leg, and no dreaded panty line peeking through. The price tag was hefty, sure, but I figured you get what you pay for. 

Turns out, not always. Honestly? They weren't *bad*, but for the money, Decathlon's basic tights did a far better job of hiding any… unfortunate lines. It’s a small thing, I know, but it got me thinking about the whole startup phenomenon. We’re drawn to the branding, the story, the promise. Sometimes, though, a simpler, more established option delivers just as well, and maybe even better. Lesson learned: don't always chase the buzz.
