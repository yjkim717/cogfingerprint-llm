### The Paper Trail of a Life

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2023, we live our lives digitally, with every memory backed up in the cloud. But the moments that truly define us are often held hostage on a piece of paper in some forgotten filing cabinet.

I was thinking about this after a call with my uncle, a veteran. He’s been wrestling with the VA, trying to prove his own history. A misspelled name on a decades-old form, a record that’s simply vanished—these tiny bureaucratic ghosts are blocking the benefits he earned. His entire service, his sacrifices, reduced to a frantic search for a document.

It hit me hard. We spend so much time curating our online personas, but our real legacy can be so fragile. It’s a stark reminder to hold onto our own stories, to safeguard the letters, the photos, the official papers. Because sometimes, the most important fight isn't on a battlefield; it's proving you were ever there at all.
