## The Weight of Expectations & a Texas-Sized Dose of Guilt

Okay, deep breath. I'm back. Back from a week spent in Texas, surrounded by family, and feeling…complicated. It's funny, isn't it? You anticipate these trips – reunions, shared meals, catching up – and picture this idyllic scene of connection and joy. And sometimes, they are. But this one? This one felt like carrying a backpack full of bricks.

It wasn’t the weather, though the Texas heat *was* brutal. It wasn't even the long drive. It was…everything else. Family dynamics, as anyone who's experienced them knows, are a beautiful, tangled mess. We love these people fiercely, but their expectations, their ingrained patterns, can be overwhelming. 

I’m in nursing school right now, pouring every ounce of energy I have into studying and clinicals. It’s demanding, exhilarating, and frankly, terrifying at times. But when I’m home, I feel this constant pressure to be…*something else*. Something that isn't perpetually exhausted and wrestling with complex medical terminology. Something that fits a certain mold. 

My family, bless their hearts, are devout Christians. Faith is a cornerstone of their lives, and while I respect that deeply, navigating those conversations felt like walking on eggshells.  There’s an underlying assumption that my life choices – the singlehood, the intense focus on career – are somehow…lacking.  It's not overtly critical, but it's there, hanging in the air.

The guilt is the worst. Guilt for not being who they *think* I should be. Guilt for feeling anxious and overwhelmed instead of radiating sunshine and unwavering faith. Guilt for not being "present" enough, for having my nose buried in flashcards when they want to reminisce about childhood. It’s a lonely feeling, this isolation within a room full of loved ones.

I know I need to establish clearer boundaries. I need to communicate my needs better, to explain the weight of nursing school without apologizing for it.  This trip was a stark reminder that my well-being matters too.  It's a work in progress, but I'm committed to finding a way to honor both my family and myself.  Now, back to those anatomy notes...
