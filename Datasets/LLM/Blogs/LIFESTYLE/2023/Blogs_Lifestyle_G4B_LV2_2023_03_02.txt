**Finding My Voice in the Room**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something as seemingly simple as talking about addiction can feel so…complicated? Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into Alcoholics Anonymous, and I’ve been really thinking about how we actually *do* the talking. 

The initial meetings were a blur of nodding and listening. Now, I’m experimenting with how I share my own struggles with substance use. It’s not always easy. There’s a vulnerability that creeps in, a fear of judgment. But honestly, I’ve found that simply being honest – sharing what coping mechanisms actually work *for me* – creates space for connection. 

Recovery meetings aren’t about having all the answers. They’re about leaning on each other, recognizing we're not alone. It’s about finding your voice, even when it trembles a little.  This year, I'm focusing on that – on being brave enough to share my journey, one step at a time.
