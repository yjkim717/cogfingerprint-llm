## The Salt Still Calls: Finding My Way Back to the Waves

It's funny how some things just stay with you, isn’t it? For me, it's the ocean. I surfed as a kid, loved it, then… well, life happened. A silly accident took me out of the water, and the board gathered dust. 2023 feels like the year I decided to dust it off.

It’s not like riding a bike, though. Muscle memory is a tricky thing! I’m definitely a beginner again, all awkward pop-ups and frantic paddling. I'm craving that feeling of gliding, that connection with the wave, but the drop-in feels…off. Any seasoned surfers out there have tips for a rusty learner?

Beyond the technical stuff, I’m also on the hunt for spots that don’t feel *too* intimidating. Somewhere with gentler waves, fewer crowds, a place to rediscover the joy without the pressure. Because really, that’s what this is about – reconnecting with a part of myself I thought I'd lost. The ocean is calling, and I'm answering.
