### That Time My Chill Night Took a Weird Turn

So, there I was in 2023, thinking I was a seasoned pro. A little weed was my go-to for unwinding after a long week. But this one night, feeling a bit too confident, I definitely overdid it.

What started as the usual relaxed buzz quickly spiraled. The pattern on the rug started… breathing. Just for a second, but it was enough to send my heart into my throat. This wasn't the fun, giggly high I signed up for. A wave of pure panic washed over me, followed by this gnawing paranoia that everyone could hear my racing thoughts.

Lying there in the dark, I had one clear, frantic question echoing in my mind: "Is this normal? Am I okay?"

It was a stark reminder that even something seemingly casual has its limits. My relationship with weed needed a serious check-in. It taught me that knowing your limit isn’t about being a lightweight; it’s about respecting your own mind. My mantra now? Less is almost always more.
