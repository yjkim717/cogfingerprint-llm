It’s 2023, and I’ll admit it: I used to roll my eyes at manifestation. Then I heard about a football coach who, before the Super Bowl, spent days visualizing every play, every moment of victory—not just hoping, but truly feeling it in his imagination. It reminded me of Neville Goddard’s teachings: your inner world shapes your outer reality.

So, I gave it a shot. Each morning, I didn’t just scribble goals; I closed my eyes and lived them—sipping coffee at my dream café, finishing that project, feeling the calm. And you know what? Opportunities began aligning, almost magically. It wasn’t about wishing; it was about embodying the feeling of already having it.

Now, I see life differently. Our minds aren’t just spectators—they’re co-creators. What reality will you imagine into being today?
