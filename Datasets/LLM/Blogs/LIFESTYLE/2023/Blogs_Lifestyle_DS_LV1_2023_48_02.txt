### The Miles & Memories Equation

It started with a simple dream: taking my family to see Tokyo’s cherry blossoms. The flight search, however, was anything but simple. Staring at the booking portal, I faced the ultimate travel dilemma.

I had enough Citi points to transfer for four Virgin Atlantic award tickets to book us in Singapore Airlines Premium Economy. The catch? It would cost nearly double the KrisFlyer miles of standard Economy. My practical side screamed, "It's just a seat! Save the miles for another trip." But my heart, the one that remembers cramped legs and jet-lagged kids, whispered a different story.

This wasn't just a transaction; it was an investment in our experience. Would arriving more rested, with space to laugh and stretch, make our first day in Tokyo magical instead of miserable? In 2023, where time feels more precious than ever, I’m learning that the best redemption isn't always the cheapest one—it’s the one that buys you comfort and joy. I decided to go for it. Some memories are worth the extra miles.
