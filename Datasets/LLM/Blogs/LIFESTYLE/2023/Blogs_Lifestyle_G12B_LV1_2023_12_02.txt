## The Weight of "Best" Builds – In Life and in Games

It's funny, isn't it? I was wrestling with Diablo 2 Resurrected last night, agonizing over which Assassin build to level. I poured over Wowhead and Icy Veins, searching for the *optimal* path. But it got me thinking - how often do we do that in life? Obsess over finding the "best" approach, the perfect strategy, the guaranteed win? 

Maybe the joy isn’t in achieving peak efficiency, but in the journey itself, the unexpected detours, even the flawed builds that teach us something along the way. Maybe 2023 should be about embracing the delightfully imperfect.
