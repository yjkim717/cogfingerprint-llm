The salt spray hit my face as I stood on the shore at Huntington, watching waves I used to conquer now taunt me like old ghosts. Fifteen years is a long time to be away from the ocean, and my surfboard felt foreign in my hands—a relic from a braver version of myself.

I’d forgotten how to read the water, how to spot that perfect wave beginners dream of catching. My heart hammered not with excitement, but fear. What if I’d lost the drop-in technique completely? What if the ocean had moved on without me?

But then I remembered why I’d returned. Not to prove anything, but to reconnect—with the rhythm of the waves, the thrill of the glide, and that younger self who once laughed in the face of wipeouts. So I paddled out, shaky but determined, ready to reclaim my place in the lineup. Because sometimes, the biggest wave you need to catch is the one that brings you back to yourself.
