>Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the Chipotle/job offer summary, aiming for a relatable, reflective, and conversational tone, set in 2023. I've focused on the anxiety of the waiting game and the broader experience of starting something new.

**The Email That Wasn't & the Butterflies That Still Are**

Anyone else feel like 2023 is just…a constant waiting game? I recently accepted a job – exciting, right? – and now I'm in that weird limbo between "yes!" and "actually working." I haven't gotten the official onboarding emails yet, and honestly, my brain is a whirlwind of "Did I do something wrong?" and "Are they going to change their minds?". 

It’s funny how a few missing emails can resurrect all those old first-day jitters. Starting something new, *anything* new, is always a mix of exhilaration and sheer terror. Anyone else relate? Let me know in the comments!
