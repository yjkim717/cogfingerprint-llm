>## The Quiet Pull of "Elsewhere"

I stumbled across a memory the other day – a documentary I watched years ago, probably on what used to be the Catholic Channel. It followed a young woman, barely out of her teens, making the extraordinary decision to enter a cloistered order. I remember being captivated, a little bewildered, and strangely… comforted.

Now, in 2023, surrounded by the constant buzz of notifications and the pressure to *do* all the things, I find myself thinking about it again. That quiet life, dedicated to prayer and contemplation, felt like a radical act of resistance against the noise. Not that I’m yearning for a veil and a monastery, but it sparked a question: how can we create pockets of stillness, of deliberate “elsewhere,” in our own lives, even amidst the chaos? Maybe just ten minutes of silence a day is a start.
