It’s funny how life nudges you toward change. For years, I was the go-to sysadmin—the one who kept servers humming and networks stable. But somewhere between patching systems and managing backups, I realized my heart wasn’t fully in it anymore. I’d tinker with SQL Server databases in my spare time, feeling that quiet pull toward something different.

In 2023, the buzz around Microsoft Azure and cloud roles was impossible to ignore. I started studying for Azure DBA exams, not as a chore, but as a way to explore. Each module felt like unlocking a piece of a puzzle I didn’t even know I was solving. The more I learned, the more I saw my daily tasks through a DBA’s eyes.

Now, I’m asking myself: am I ready to make the leap? It’s not just about skills; it’s about embracing a new identity. That moment you realize your passion has quietly rerouted your career—that’s when you know it’s time to start job hunting.
