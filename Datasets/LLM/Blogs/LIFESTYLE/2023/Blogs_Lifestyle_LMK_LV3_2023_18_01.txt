As a parent in 2023, I've often found myself wondering how to keep my kids connected to their extended family, despite the miles between us. With cousins scattered across the United States, it's a challenge to foster a sense of closeness and shared identity. I've been on the lookout for ideas to bridge this distance and strengthen family bonds. One approach we've taken is to establish and maintain family traditions that transcend geographical boundaries. From virtual dinner nights to shared online activities, we're exploring ways to make distance feel less daunting. By doing so, we hope to create lasting memories and a deeper understanding of our shared heritage. As I navigate the ups and downs of parenting in a dispersed family, I'm learning that with a little creativity, distance doesn't have to mean disconnection. Instead, it can be an opportunity to forge stronger, more meaningful relationships.
