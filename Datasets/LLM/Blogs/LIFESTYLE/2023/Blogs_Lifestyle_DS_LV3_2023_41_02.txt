It’s 2023, and I can’t help but marvel at how much things evolve—not just in life, but in sports, too. Watching today’s NFL, with its intricate schemes and playbooks thicker than novels, I wonder if icons like Joe Namath would even recognize the game. It reminds me that staying sharp, whether in football or daily life, means embracing change and deepening our knowledge—one play, one day at a time.
