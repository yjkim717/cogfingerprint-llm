The first time I walked into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, my palms were sweating. It was 2023, and I was fresh out of rehab for a pill addiction that had nearly cost me everything. I clutched my coffee, listening to story after story about vodka and whiskey, feeling like an imposter. My demon wasn't in a bottle; it was in a prescription bottle.

I wrestled with the etiquette. Do I just substitute the word "drinking" when I share? Do I have the right to be here at all? The "alcohol" in the name felt like a giant, blinking neon sign pointing me toward the door.

But then, an older man shared about his recovery from cocaine, right there in an AA room. He didn't code-switch or apologize. He just told his truth—the chaos, the desperation, the hope he found in the shared experience of recovery, not the specific substance. That was my turning point.

I realized the program's heart isn't about the liquid in a glass; it's about the honesty in the heart. My journey to find my voice in those rooms became a huge part of my own healing. Now, I share my full story—the pills, the lies, the moment I decided to live. I found that my truth didn't break the traditions; it reinforced them. Because addiction, in any form, is a prison, and recovery is the key we all help each other find.
