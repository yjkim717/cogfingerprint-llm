## Beyond Beige: Embracing Whimsy in the Guest Bathroom

Okay, so I’ve finally bought my first house! It's been a whirlwind of boxes and paint swatches, but I’m slowly starting to feel settled. And let me tell you, the guest bathroom was… a challenge. Think dated wallpaper and a truly baffling shade of beige. 

I’m determined to make it feel welcoming, a little *different*. I’ve been obsessing over textured walls lately - specifically, knockdown texture. It adds so much depth, you know? But I didn't want to stop there. I’m leaning hard into a whimsical theme, inspired by *Alice in Wonderland*. Not a literal cartoon explosion, but more subtle nods – maybe a mural of swirling teacups, or a gallery wall with vintage botanical prints. 

It feels like a huge leap from the beige, but I'm excited to inject a little personality into this space. It’s a reminder that even small corners of our homes can be opportunities for playful expression. Wish me luck – the texture roller is calling!
