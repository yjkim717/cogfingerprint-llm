**Instant Pot Chicken Conundrum**

Okay, real talk: I’ve been obsessed with my Instant Pot lately, but I’m still wrestling with a tiny kitchen dilemma. Specifically, chicken breasts.

Maybe it’s the quiet time, but it’s become my go-to for a seriously easy, comforting weeknight meal. What are your Instant Pot secrets?
