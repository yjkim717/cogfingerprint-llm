**The Frustration of a Growing Project**

Let’s be honest, juggling a creative project in 2023 feels a bit like trying to hold a thousand puzzle pieces in your hand – and sometimes, those pieces just slip away. I’ve been wrestling with a personal project lately, and it’s highlighted something really interesting about how we work with technology. 

It’s like having a brilliant AI assistant (think GPT-4) that *understands* code, but gets completely lost when you ask it to integrate a new feature into a larger codebase. The ‘context window’ – the amount it can ‘remember’ – just isn’t big enough. 

It’s a frustrating feeling, isn't it? Like you’re building something amazing, but a limitation is constantly pulling you back. It makes you wonder about the future of these large language models and how we’ll scale them to truly handle the complexities of real-world projects.  Maybe the key is not just bigger models, but smarter ways to connect them.
