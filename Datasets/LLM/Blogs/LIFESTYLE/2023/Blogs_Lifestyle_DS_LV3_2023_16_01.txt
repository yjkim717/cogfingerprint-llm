It’s 2023, and I’ll admit—I was skeptical when I first heard about using ChatGPT to study. I mean, could an AI really help me remember things better? But I gave it a shot, and wow, what a game-changer.

Here’s how it worked for me: I’d ask ChatGPT to generate Q&As on topics I was learning. Then, I’d handwrite the answers—there’s something about pen and paper that just makes ideas stick. Finally, I’d plug those questions into Anki for spaced repetition. Sure, it took time, and occasionally a detail slipped through the cracks, but the payoff was real.

Suddenly, concepts that used to fade after a week were sticking around for good. It felt like I was finally hacking my brain’s memory system. In a world full of digital noise, this blend of old-school handwriting and smart tech made learning feel personal again. Who knew that slowing down could help you remember so much more?
