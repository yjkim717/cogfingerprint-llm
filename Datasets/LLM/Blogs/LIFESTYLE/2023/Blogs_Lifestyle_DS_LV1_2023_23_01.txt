### Finding My Third Act: More Than Just a Game

It’s funny how the quest for a new Dungeons & Dragons campaign starts to feel less like a hobby and more like a lifestyle choice. As I found myself scrolling through online forums for a *third* campaign recently, it hit me: this isn't just about rolling dice anymore. It’s about building a small, consistent pocket of community in a world that often feels too big and too disconnected.

My first campaign was a classic, learning-the-rules affair with college friends. The second was a deep, character-driven story that got me through a tough patch in 2021. Now, in 2023, my criteria have evolved. I’m not just looking for a 5e game; I’m looking for a specific *vibe*. A space that’s openly LGBTQ+ friendly, where creativity is encouraged through homebrew worlds, and where the schedule respects that we’re all adults with day jobs. It’s a tall order, but it’s a necessary one.

This search has mirrored my approach to life lately—being more intentional. I’m no longer willing to squeeze myself into spaces that don’t fit. I want the flexibility of online play, yes, but more importantly, I want the guarantee of mutual respect. Finding that perfect group isn't just about slaying dragons on a Tuesday night; it's about claiming a few precious hours where I can be a fully realized person—flaws, quirks, and all—around a virtual table with people who get it. And honestly, that’s a quest worth embarking on.
