### Sitting with the Storm

For years, my solution to any big, messy feeling was the same: a glass of wine. Anxiety, stress, even boredom—I’d pour a drink and wait for the fuzz to settle over the sharp edges. When I got sober in 2022, I naively thought I was just giving up alcohol. What I quickly realized was that I was giving up my only coping mechanism, and I was terrified of what would happen when the next emotional storm hit.

That storm came, of course. But instead of reaching for a bottle, I did something that felt utterly foreign: I sat down, closed my eyes, and just… breathed. It wasn’t a magic cure. The first few times meditating, my mind was a chaotic riot of thoughts. But I stuck with it. I learned, through therapy and practice, that I didn’t need to numb the feeling to make it through. I just had to feel it.

Now, in 2023, sitting with discomfort is my superpower. The anxiety still visits, but it no longer moves in and unpacks its bags. I meet it at the door, acknowledge it, and trust that it will pass. It turns out the peace I was searching for at the bottom of a glass was inside me all along. I just had to get quiet enough to hear it.
