As I sat with my M2 MacBook Air, I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration. I was excited to dive into Stellaris, a Paradox game I'd been eyeing for months, but it refused to run smoothly. The compatibility claims seemed like a distant memory as I battled glitches and freezes. It's moments like these that make me appreciate the little things in life - a seamless gaming experience being one of them. Is our reliance on technology making us too forgiving of its flaws?
