**The Quest 2: From Dream to Dust Bunny**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2023 felt like the year VR was *finally* going to take off. I saw everyone raving about the Quest 2, promising immersive worlds and a total escape. I jumped on the bandwagon, naturally. I envisioned myself exploring ancient ruins, learning to fly, maybe even finally conquering that online puzzle game I’d been putting off. 

The initial few hours were… incredible. The novelty was *real*. It was genuinely mind-blowing to be physically present in these digital spaces. I spent a ridiculous amount of time just wandering around, gawking at the scenery. 

But then… the nausea hit. Not a dramatic, debilitating wave, but a persistent, unsettling feeling of being slightly off-balance. And honestly, after a while, the “escape” just felt… exhausting. 

Now, the Quest 2 sits in a box in my closet. It’s become a beautiful, shiny dust bunny, a reminder of a hopeful experiment. It’s funny, isn't it? How something that initially felt so revolutionary can quickly morph into just… a gadget.  

Maybe VR will get there eventually. But for me, right now, it’s firmly in the “novelty” category – a fascinating glimpse into the future, but not quite a lifestyle upgrade.
