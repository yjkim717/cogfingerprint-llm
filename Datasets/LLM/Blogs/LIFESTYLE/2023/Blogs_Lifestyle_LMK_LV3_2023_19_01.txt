"Renovating my home has been a journey of trial and error. Recently, I faced a drywall dilemma after relocating outlets. I wondered if I could simply mud over the old screw holes or if it would be noticeable. After some research, I learned that with the right techniques and materials, a seamless finish is achievable. Now, my walls are smooth, and I'm proud of the DIY work I've done."
