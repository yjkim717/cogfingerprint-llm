The holiday season is supposed to be the most wonderful time of the year, right? That’s what the songs tell us, at least. But as I packed my bag in December 2023, heading back to my childhood home, a familiar knot tightened in my stomach. It wasn’t about the travel stress of crowded airports or delayed flights. It was a deeper, more personal dread—the quiet hum of family anxiety that always seemed to amplify the moment I crossed the threshold.

You see, my life in the city is built on a foundation my family doesn't quite recognize. My career, my friends, my daily rhythms—they’re all part of an identity I’ve carefully crafted, one that feels authentic to me. But at home, I subtly shrink back into the person they remember. The questions, however well-intentioned, feel like tiny audits: "When are you going to settle down?" "Are you sure that job is secure?" Each one chips away at my sense of self, leaving me feeling strangely isolated in a house full of people I love.

And then comes the emotional guilt, a heavy blanket that smothers any flicker of frustration. How can I feel this way when they’re just happy to see me? The pressure to perform holiday cheer, to be the happy, grateful daughter, becomes a performance. I find myself smiling through conversations that leave me emotionally drained, clinging to my phone in my old bedroom just to steal a moment where I don’t have to perform.

I’ve started to realize that this tension isn’t a sign that something is broken. It’s the natural friction of a life in motion, grinding against the steady, familiar stone of home. The challenge, I’m learning, isn’t to eliminate the pressure, but to navigate it with my boundaries intact. To love them fiercely, while also quietly loving the person I’ve become away from them. Maybe that’s the real holiday work—not just wrapping presents, but holding onto yourself.
