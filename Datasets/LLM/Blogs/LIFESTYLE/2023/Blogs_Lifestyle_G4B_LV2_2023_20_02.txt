**The Weight of the Door**

It’s funny how small moments can stick with you. I was just thinking about a story a researcher shared with me – they’re documenting school lockdown drills, really digging into how these experiences impact kids and the stress it creates. It made me remember my own elementary school days, that knot of anxiety tightening every time the intercom crackled. 

As adults, we often talk about "occupational stress," but those childhood moments build a foundation.  It’s a reminder to be mindful of the subtle pressures we place on the young ones in our lives, and to create spaces where they feel safe and secure – a little less like behind a locked door.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, or perhaps create a post focused on a different angle?
