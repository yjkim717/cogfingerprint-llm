As I watched the Eagles soar to victory, I couldn't help but think about the power of manifestation and visualization. Their head coach had been open about visualizing himself on that stage, lifting that trophy, and I was struck by the parallels to Neville Goddard's teachings on the law of attraction. It's a potent reminder that our thoughts and imagination can shape our reality. In 2023, we're constantly bombarded with messages telling us to "manifest our dreams" and "visualize success." But what does that really mean? For me, it's about tapping into the energy of what I want to create, and letting go of limitations. As I reflect on my own goals and aspirations, I'm inspired to get intentional about my own visualization practice. What about you - what are you manifesting in your life right now?
