It’s funny, isn't it? How projects like this mirror life. Sometimes you have to pull things apart, rearrange, and start again. It's messy, it's frustrating, but there's a quiet satisfaction in seeing it come together, even if it’s a little imperfect. And honestly, that slightly uneven texture? It's got character.
