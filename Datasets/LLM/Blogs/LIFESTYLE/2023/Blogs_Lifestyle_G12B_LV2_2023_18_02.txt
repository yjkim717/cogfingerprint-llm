## Little Hands, Sea-Kissed Treasures, and a Summer Stand

There's something magical about a child’s enthusiasm, isn’t there? My five-year-old has been utterly captivated by sea glass lately. Every hike transforms into a treasure hunt, pockets overflowing with frosted green and milky white gems. We've amassed quite the collection! 

This year, we’re channeling that ocean-inspired joy into a little project: decorating a simple plant stand for our summer porch. It's a chance to slow down, get a little messy, and create something beautiful together. More than the finished product, I’m savoring these moments of shared creativity – a simple reminder of the beauty in slowing down and appreciating the little things.
