## My Xbox Series S Spring Cleaning & a Little Bit of Digital Letting Go

Okay, so I finally caved and got an external hard drive for my Xbox Series S. Huge win! But it brought up a realization: all that Dev Mod tinkering and emulator fun had eaten *serious* space. Now, with extra storage, Iâ€™m facing a digital declutter. Factory reset? It feels drastic, like erasing memories! It's strangely relatable to life, isn't it? Sometimes you need a clean slate to truly appreciate the new possibilities. Anyone else ever feel that way about their tech?
