## The SUV Dilemma: Family Adventures on a Budget

It's 2023, and our family's weekend adventures are calling! We’re a family of four, and the trusty sedan just isn't cutting it anymore. Lately, I’ve been deep in the used car rabbit hole, specifically eyeing SUVs. The Ford Edge, Honda Passport, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Kia Sorento keep popping up – all within that sweet $25-30k range. It's a surprisingly tough choice! Beyond cargo space, I'm thinking about reliability and that feeling of confident, comfortable travel. Any fellow weekend warriors out there with SUV wisdom to share?
