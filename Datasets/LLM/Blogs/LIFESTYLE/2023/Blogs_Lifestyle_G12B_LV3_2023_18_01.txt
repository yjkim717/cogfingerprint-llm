>## The Scattered Pieces of Our Family Puzzle

It’s 2023, and life feels…scattered. Not in a bad way, necessarily. My kids are grown, forging their own paths, living in different cities, building their own lives. Which is wonderful! Truly. But it’s also left me feeling a little like I’m holding the pieces of a beautiful family puzzle, and they’re all spread out across the map.

We're a close-knit extended family, always have been. The thought of losing that connection, especially for the grandkids, tugs at my heart. My kids, bless them, aren't keen on uprooting themselves – and who can blame them? But how do we nurture those crucial bonds when miles separate us?

I've been brainstorming. Virtual game nights, themed family movie watches, even just scheduling regular video calls. It’s not the same as spontaneous hugs and shared meals, but it’s *something*. It's about actively creating shared experiences, weaving those threads of connection together, even across the distance. It's a work in progress, a conscious effort, but so worth it to keep our family puzzle whole.
