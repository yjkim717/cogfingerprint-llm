There’s a moment in early sobriety when you realize it’s not just about quitting—it’s about changing your entire perspective. I used to think I could stop drinking anytime; it was just a matter of willpower. But 2023 has taught me that real recovery means confronting the reality of addiction, not just the idea of it.

Some days, staying sober feels like climbing a mountain in the rain. But with each step, my attitude shifts. I’m not just avoiding a drink; I’m rediscovering life without the fog. It’s messy, it’s raw, but it’s honest. And in that honesty, I’ve found a version of myself I actually want to wake up with.
