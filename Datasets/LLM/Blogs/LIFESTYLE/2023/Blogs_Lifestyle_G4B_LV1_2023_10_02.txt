**The Illusion of Easy Sobriety**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How you can *think* you’re ready to quit drinking, almost with a naive confidence. I definitely had that feeling back in 2023. I pictured myself suddenly strong, effortlessly choosing water over wine.  

The reality hit hard, though.  The first few weeks were…fine. But then, the little justifications started creeping in. “Just one glass,” “It’s been a stressful day.”  It felt like I was battling a shifting landscape of attitudes, convincing myself I still needed it. 

Looking back, I realize I hadn't truly changed *why* I drank.  It wasn’t about wanting to be sober; it was about avoiding something else.  That’s a lesson I’m still learning, and honestly, it’s a much harder fight than I ever anticipated.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the experience?
