**The Quiet Shift in My Garden**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How sometimes the biggest changes happen not with a bang, but a slow, deliberate weeding. This year, I’ve been really focusing on my little patch of a garden, and it’s mirrored something I’ve been feeling about my approach to…well, everything. 

I used to stubbornly cling to certain methods, convinced they were *the* way to grow the best tomatoes. But this season, I’ve realized the AKP – let’s call it the established way of doing things – just wasn’t serving me. It felt rigid, resistant to change. 

So, I’ve started experimenting. Different soil, different sunlight exposure. It’s a bit unsettling, admitting that what worked before isn't necessarily the best now. But there’s a quiet satisfaction in trying new things, in conceding that maybe, just maybe, a different strategy will yield a richer harvest.  It’s a good reminder, really.
