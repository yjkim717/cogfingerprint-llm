## The Sagittarius Spark: A Brief, Bright Encounter

Okay, so I’ve always felt pretty grounded. Virgo sun, Libra rising, Pisces moon – earth, air, and water swirling together. It creates a certain… stability. But then there are those people who just *shake* things up. Lately, I've been thinking about Sagittarians. 

I don’t cross paths with them often, which is probably a good thing, because they’re intense! I had a brief relationship a few years back with a Sagittarius, and honestly, it was a whirlwind. It felt like a supernova – incredibly bright, undeniably impactful, but ultimately, not sustainable for my particular orbit. 

It’s 2023, and I’m appreciating the quiet, the routine. But I'm also grateful for those fleeting bursts of fiery energy that remind me there's a whole universe of experiences out there.
