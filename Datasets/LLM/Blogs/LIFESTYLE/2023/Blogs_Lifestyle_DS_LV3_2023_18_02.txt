It all started with my five-year-old’s overflowing jar of sea glass. Last summer, we turned those little treasures into simple crafts—no fancy tools, just glue and imagination. Now, in 2023, we’re setting up a tiny plant stand, selling our creations. It’s more than a project; it’s a lesson in patience and seeing beauty in what others leave behind. Who knew these tiny, weathered gems could root us so deeply in the present moment?
