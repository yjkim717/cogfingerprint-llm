It’s funny—I used to think mastering my Genmitsu 3020Pro Max CNC was just about Fusion 360 settings and feed rates. But in 2023, I realized it’s a lot like life: finding the right rhythm, balancing speed with precision, and avoiding those frustrating pauses. When I dialed in the resolution and block processing speed, the machine hummed smoothly. It reminded me that sometimes, the sweet spot isn’t rushing ahead, but moving steadily, with intention.
