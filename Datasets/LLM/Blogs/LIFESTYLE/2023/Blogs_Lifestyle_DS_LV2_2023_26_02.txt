There I was, staring into the mirror at my morning hair—a frizzy, deflated version of the perfect perm I’d had just hours before. It was 2023, and my post-sleep routine felt like a daily battle against the pillow. Then I discovered a simple curl cream ritual. Now, each morning, I gently revive those waves, transforming chaos into defined, bouncy curls. It’s not just maintenance; it’s a moment of self-care that sets a peaceful tone for the entire day.
