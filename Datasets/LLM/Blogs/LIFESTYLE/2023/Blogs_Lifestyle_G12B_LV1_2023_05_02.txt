## The Ripple Effect of a Wipeout

It’s funny how one moment can completely shift your perspective. Last summer, I had a pretty spectacular wipeout surfing at Huntington. Not the graceful, sandy-bottom kind, either. Let’s just say I met the reef with a little more enthusiasm than intended. Thankfully, nothing serious – just some bumps, bruises, and a serious dent in my confidence.

Before that day, I was feeling pretty good about my surfing. I'd been consistently catching waves, even attempting (and occasionally nailing!) a drop-in. Now? The thought of paddling out makes my stomach clench. I find myself obsessing over wave size, over-analyzing every swell. It’s frustrating.

It's not just about surfing, though. This little incident has highlighted something bigger. I realized I've been pushing myself, chasing that "perfect" feeling in a lot of areas of my life – work, fitness, even just keeping up with the endless scroll of social media.  And when I inevitably fall short, it’s knocked me off balance.

This year, I'm trying a different approach. Less striving, more appreciating the process.  I'm looking for beginner surf lessons again, focusing on the fundamentals, on just *enjoying* being in the water.  I’m also trying to be kinder to myself when things don't go as planned.  Because, let’s be honest, life isn't about flawlessly riding every wave, it’s about getting back up after you wipe out—and maybe even laughing about it a little.  Anyone else ever had a setback that ended up teaching them a valuable life lesson? I'd love to hear about it.
