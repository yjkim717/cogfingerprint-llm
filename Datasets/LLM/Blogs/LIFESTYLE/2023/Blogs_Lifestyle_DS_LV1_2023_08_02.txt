### The Guest Bathroom That Swallowed Time

Last year, I decided our beige, knockdown-textured guest bathroom needed a personality. Everyone said textured walls were a nightmare to paint, a design dead-end. But I saw a blank, dimensional canvas. Inspired by a worn copy of *Alice in Wonderland*, I went for it.

I commissioned a local artist to paint a subtle, sprawling mural of the Queen’s rose garden directly onto the texture. The raised surfaces gave the petals and leaves an incredible, tactile depth. Now, that little room isn't just a bathroom; it’s a conversation starter, a tiny pocket of whimsy. It taught me a 2023 lesson: the biggest design risks—the ones that defy the "rules"—often bring the most magic into our daily lives. Sometimes, you just have to fall down the rabbit hole.
