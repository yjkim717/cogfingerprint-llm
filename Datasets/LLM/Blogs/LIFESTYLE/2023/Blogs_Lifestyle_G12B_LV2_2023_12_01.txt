## The Unexpected Joy of Saying "No" (and a Little Diablo Nostalgia)

It’s 2023, and I'm finally realizing saying "yes" to everything just leaves you depleted. Lately, I’ve been practicing the art of “no.” It’s surprisingly liberating! Funny enough, it reminded me of agonizing over assassin builds in Diablo back in the day – choosing what to prioritize, what skills to *not* invest in. 

Now, I'm applying that same focused energy to my life. Less scattered commitments, more genuine joy. It's a slower pace, but feels infinitely richer. Anyone else finding small shifts making a big difference?
