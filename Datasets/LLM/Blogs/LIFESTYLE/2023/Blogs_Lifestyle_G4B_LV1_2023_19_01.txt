**The Ghosts in the Walls**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple home improvement project can suddenly bring up a whole lot of anxieties. I was tackling some outlet relocation last week, and the thought hit me: all those old screw holes in the drywall… am I just patching over problems for the future? 

My dad always said, "Leave it alone if you don’t have to." But the urge to *fix* is strong.  It’s a little bit about control, I think, and a little bit about wanting a perfectly smooth surface.  Maybe a little mudding is okay, but it’s worth considering the long game.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post focused on a different angle (e.g., a more detailed explanation of screw hole issues)?
