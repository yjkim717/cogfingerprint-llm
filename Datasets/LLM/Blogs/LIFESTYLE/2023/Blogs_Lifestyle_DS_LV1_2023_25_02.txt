The other day, a friend confided in me about feeling adrift—questioning their purpose and worth. It reminded me of a 2023 podcast where a therapist shared her fear that such deep conversations might unintentionally amplify someone’s pain. It struck a chord. In our fast-paced lives, we often skip past these moments, but maybe sitting with uncertainty, together, is part of the healing. Sometimes, the bravest step is just to listen.
