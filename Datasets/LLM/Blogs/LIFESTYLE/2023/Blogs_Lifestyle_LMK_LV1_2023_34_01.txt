"Getting back to my childhood passion for gokarting has been a game-changer for me in 2023. As I dove into designing my own suspension parts using Fusion 360, I realized how much I'd grown as a 3D thinker. But, boy, was it a struggle! Creating multiple planes and visualizing components in 3D space had me scratching my head. Now, with a more streamlined CAD workflow and the help of Fusion 360's pipe tool, I'm able to bring my ideas to life. It's amazing how a hobby can challenge and reward you in equal measure."
