There’s something about a white Ford Explorer that still makes my heart skip a beat in 2023. It’s a Pavlovian response left over from years of seeing them as the unofficial car of suburban police.

Now, I spot one in my rearview mirror, and my hands instinctively tighten on the wheel. I check my speed, my blinker, my soul. Then it zooms past, just another SUV with a coffee-sipping driver, completely unaware of the minor existential crisis they just triggered.

It’s a strange, modern anxiety—a civilian vehicle that borrows the silhouette of authority, turning a simple lane change into a moment of unwarranted panic. I’m not mad at the drivers; I’m just tired of the involuntary adrenaline.
