As I launched my e-commerce app in 2023, I wondered: should I focus on building a community on social media first, or establish a strong brand identity? It hit me that people don't just buy products, they buy experiences and associations. Before building a following, I need to define my brand's voice and values. Only then can I create a meaningful community that resonates with my audience and drives long-term loyalty.
