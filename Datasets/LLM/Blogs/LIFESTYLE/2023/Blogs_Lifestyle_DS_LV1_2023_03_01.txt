It’s funny how a loading screen can make you pause and reflect. Just last week, I was trying to dive into Stellaris on my new M2 MacBook Air—supposedly perfect for Paradox games—only for it to crash at 80% every time. There I was, staring at that frozen progress bar, and it hit me: isn’t that a bit like life in 2023? We race toward goals, but sometimes the universe hits pause, reminding us to breathe and appreciate the journey, not just the destination. Maybe that glitch was a gift in disguise.
