This summer, my five-year-old’s sea glass collection became the heart of our garden. We’ve been spending afternoons on hikes, filling our pockets with smoothed treasures – emerald greens, dusky blues, even a flash of ruby red.  Instead of letting them gather dust, we’re crafting little mosaics to decorate our new plant stand. It's surprisingly meditative, a simple way to connect with nature and her beauty, and watch my little one’s creativity blossom alongside the summer plants.  It feels good to slow down and build something beautiful together.
