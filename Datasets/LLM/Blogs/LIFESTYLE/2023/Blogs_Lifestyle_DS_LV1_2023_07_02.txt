**The Paper Trail of My Life**

It’s funny how your entire identity can hinge on a few pieces of paper. I’ve been navigating the VA system this past year for my disability claim, and let me tell you, it’s been a journey. I have a 40% rating, which is a start, but the process to get there was a masterclass in patience.

The biggest hiccup? My own name. Somewhere between my enlistment papers and my DD-214, my last name gained an extra letter. To me, it was a tiny typo. To the system, it was a red flag that seemingly made my entire service record vanish into thin air. Suddenly, proving I was the same person who served felt like an impossible bureaucratic puzzle.

It’s a strange, reflective feeling. You carry these memories, these experiences that shaped you, and then you’re told they don’t officially exist because of a clerical error. It’s a stark reminder to double-check the small things—because sometimes, the smallest details hold the most weight. I’m still waiting, hopeful that the National Archives can help piece my story back together, one correct document at a time.
