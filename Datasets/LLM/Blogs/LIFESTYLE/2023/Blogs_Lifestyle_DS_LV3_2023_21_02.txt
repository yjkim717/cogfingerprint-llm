It’s funny how life works sometimes. Last year, I stumbled upon the teachings of Neville Goddard, and it completely shifted how I view my own imagination. I used to think visualization was just daydreaming—until I heard about the Eagles’ head coach visualizing his team at the Super Bowl before the season even began. He didn’t just see it; he combined mental imagery with sounds, feelings, and belief.

That story stuck with me. I started applying it to my own life, closing my eyes and truly immersing myself in the reality I wanted to create. It’s not magic—it’s training your mind to recognize opportunities and align your actions with your vision. Whether it’s landing a new job or improving relationships, this practice has taught me that what we consistently imagine, we move toward. And honestly? It feels like stepping into a version of your life that’s already waiting for you.
