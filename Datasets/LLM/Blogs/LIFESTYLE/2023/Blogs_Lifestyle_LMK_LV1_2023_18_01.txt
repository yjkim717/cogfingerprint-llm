"Keeping Extended Family Ties Alive Across Miles"

As I watch my kids grow, I'm constantly reminded of the importance of family bonding - especially with their cousins who live far, far away. With our extended family scattered across the US, it's a challenge to keep those special relationships alive. But in 2023, technology has been a lifesaver! Regular video chats have become a staple, allowing us to catch up on each other's lives and share in milestones. We also make it a point to create shared experiences, like cooking traditional family recipes together over video call or starting a virtual book club. These small moments have made a huge difference, and I love seeing my kids laugh and chat with their cousins as if they were in the same room. It's not the same as being there in person, but it's a great start to keeping those family ties strong despite the distance.
