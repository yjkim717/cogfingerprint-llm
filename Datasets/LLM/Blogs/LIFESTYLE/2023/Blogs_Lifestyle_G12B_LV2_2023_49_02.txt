## Kyiv Calling... and My Hesitations

A friend reached out this week with a rather unusual request: he’s being asked to travel to Kyiv for a construction project. Kyiv! My mind immediately went to news headlines, to the ongoing conflict, to… safety. It’s a stark reminder of the world’s fragility, isn’t it? 

It's easy to get caught up in the everyday – grocery lists and laundry – and forget the realities faced by so many. This situation has stirred a quiet anxiety within me.  It’s not just about his safety, but a broader feeling of uneasiness.  I’m sending him all the positive vibes and hoping he finds clarity and peace in his decision. It makes you appreciate the simple privilege of feeling safe at home.
