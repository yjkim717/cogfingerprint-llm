"As I reflect on 2020, I'm reminded of the resilience we all tapped into during the pandemic. Much like Rocky IV's underdog spirit, we faced our own battles - be it isolation or uncertainty. The film's 1985 release predates the Chernobyl disaster, but what if it had come out afterwards? Would the narrative have changed? This got me thinking - just as Rocky's story could have been different, our 2020 stories were rewritten by the challenges we overcame."
