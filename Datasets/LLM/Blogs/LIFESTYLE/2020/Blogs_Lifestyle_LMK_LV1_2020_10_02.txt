As I sit here, reflecting on the past few months of 2020, I'm reminded of the power of vulnerability in our journey towards sobriety and personal growth. It's funny how certain books and TV shows can resonate with us at exactly the right moment, isn't it? For me, that moment came when I devoured Brené Brown's "Daring Greatly" and binge-watched the heartwarming series "Schitt's Creek".

As someone in recovery, I've come to realize that vulnerability is not weakness, but a strength. Brown's book was a poignant reminder that embracing our imperfections and being open about our struggles is the first step towards healing. I recall feeling a lump in my throat as I read about the importance of living wholeheartedly, without apology or pretension. It was like she was speaking directly to my soul. Her words echoed my own experiences in recovery, where I've learned to be vulnerable with others, sharing my story and struggles with a community that understands and supports me.

Around the same time, I became hooked on "Schitt's Creek", a show that beautifully captures the essence of human connection and the power of vulnerability. The characters' willingness to be open and honest with each other, despite their flaws and quirks, was a balm to my soul. I found myself laughing, crying, and nodding along with the show's portrayal of complex, imperfect relationships. The show's creator, Dan Levy, has said that the show is about "being seen and being loved for who you are." It's a sentiment that resonated deeply with me, as I've navigated the ups and downs of recovery.

As I reflect on my journey, I realize that these two seemingly disparate sources – a self-help book and a TV show – have had a profound impact on my recovery journey. They've reminded me that personal growth is not a solo endeavor, but rather a journey that requires connection, empathy, and understanding. By embracing vulnerability, I've been able to form deeper connections with others and develop a more compassionate relationship with myself.

As we navigate the challenges of 2020, I'm grateful for the reminders that we're not alone in our struggles. Whether it's through a book, a TV show, or a supportive community, I encourage you to seek out sources of inspiration and connection that nourish your mind, heart, and soul. Let's continue to dare greatly, be vulnerable, and support one another on this journey towards healing and growth.
