It was the spring of 2020, and my new, top-of-the-line Android phone felt like a lifeline during those isolating early lockdown days. I was so excited when my friend in Portugal invited me to a video call, a welcome virtual escape. But when I arrived in Lisbon for a work trip later that year, that same expensive device became a source of immense frustration. No signal. My calls wouldn't connect, and my messages failed to send.

I watched enviously as a colleague with an older iPhone seamlessly hopped on a call. It hit me then: our smartphones, these devices we carry everywhere, should truly be our keys to the world, not just to our own neighborhood. In a time when global connection felt more precious than ever, my flashy phone was just a local toy. It made me realize that for a truly global lifestyle, we need technology that works with the world, not against it.
