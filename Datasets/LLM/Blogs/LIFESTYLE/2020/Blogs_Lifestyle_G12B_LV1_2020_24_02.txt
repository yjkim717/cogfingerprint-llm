>## The Dampening Effect

It’s funny how life can mirror the quirks of an old car. My Fiesta, a 2004 Zetec, developed this bizarre habit – it would refuse to start on wet mornings, purring perfectly fine on dry days. 2020 felt a bit like that, didn’t it?

We’d been building momentum, plans laid, dreams in motion, and then *bam* - a sudden downpour of uncertainty. Everything felt sluggish, difficult, and frankly, a bit frustrating. But then, the sun would peek through, and a sense of normalcy would return. I guess it's a reminder that even when things feel dampened, a little patience and sunshine eventually break through. Just like my Fiesta.
