The walls were closing in after months at home. So I grabbed my keys, pointed the car west, and found myself on a winding road to the coast. That solo drive, with nothing but my thoughts and the evergreen blur, was the escape I desperately needed. It wasn't about the destination, but the simple, liberating act of moving forward again. A small pandemic victory.
