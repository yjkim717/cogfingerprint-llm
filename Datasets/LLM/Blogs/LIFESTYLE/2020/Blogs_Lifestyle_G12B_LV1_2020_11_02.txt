## The Unexpected Garden and the Little Servers

It’s funny how life throws curveballs, isn’t it? 2020 has been… well, *a year*. For me, it started with a fairly predictable trajectory: work, gym, occasional social gathering, repeat. Then, the world shifted. Suddenly, "occasional" became "nonexistent," and the gym felt… risky.

Instead of panicking, I found myself drawn to a different kind of project. My tiny balcony, previously home to a single, struggling basil plant, became a full-blown garden. Tomatoes, peppers, even a few herbs I can’t pronounce are thriving. It’s surprisingly meditative, tending to these little lives, watching them grow. It’s a tangible sense of accomplishment in a world that often feels utterly out of control.

But the gardening wasn't the *only* unexpected shift. Stuck at home, I also dove headfirst into a tech rabbit hole. I'd been hearing about Kubernetes for ages, and its reputation as a container orchestration system intrigued me. Seeing the garden flourish sparked a similar idea – managing and scaling small, independent systems. So, I ordered a few Raspberry Pi 4s. 

Now, I'm tinkering with K3s, trying to figure out the networking – VLANs and all the fun stuff. It’s a steep learning curve, definitely more complex than repotting a tomato plant, but there's a parallel in the process. Both require patience, careful configuration, and a willingness to troubleshoot when things go wrong. 

It's a strange combination, nurturing life in both the digital and literal sense. Maybe that’s 2020 in a nutshell: finding unexpected pockets of growth and order amidst the chaos. And honestly? I'm kind of enjoying it.
