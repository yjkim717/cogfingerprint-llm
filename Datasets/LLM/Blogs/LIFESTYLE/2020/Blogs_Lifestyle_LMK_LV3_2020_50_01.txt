As I navigated the world of web development in 2020, I found myself stuck on creating a navbar that truly reflected my personal style. The struggle was real - I wanted a seamless blend of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to bring my vision to life. But with every attempt, I'd end up with a clumsy design. It wasn't until I took a step back and re-evaluated my approach that I achieved the perfect overlap. Just like in life, sometimes we need to re-route our path to reach our desired destination, and that's exactly what I learned that year.
