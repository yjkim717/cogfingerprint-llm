## The Clicky Quest: A Pandemic Keyboard Upgrade

2020. The year of lockdowns, sourdough, and unexpectedly, a deep dive into the world of mechanical keyboards. My trusty old membrane keyboard finally gave up the ghost, sputtering its last keystroke just as I was mid-email. A replacement was needed, but braving a crowded electronics store? Absolutely not. Pandemic life, remember?

So, I did what any sensible (and slightly obsessive) person would do: I went down a rabbit hole. Specifically, the rabbit hole of Cherry MX switches. Blue, Brown, Red… the terminology was overwhelming! I spent hours reading reviews, watching YouTube videos showcasing the satisfying *click* of blues and the smoother feel of browns. 

It's funny, isn't it? Finding solace and a new hobby in something so seemingly small. This keyboard quest became a little ritual, a small act of control in a year that felt anything but.  I finally settled on a brown switch keyboard – a compromise, perhaps, but one that feels surprisingly good under my fingers.  A small upgrade, a small victory, in a very strange year.
