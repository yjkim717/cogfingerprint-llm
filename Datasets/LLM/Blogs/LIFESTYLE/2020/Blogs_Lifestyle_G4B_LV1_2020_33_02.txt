**Beyond the Filter: A 2020 Reflection**

It feels a little strange writing this now, in 2020, but I’ve been wrestling with something lately – specifically, the way we talk about bodies. I’ve been really appreciating the rise of the body positivity movement, honestly. The idea that *every* body is worthy, beautiful, and deserves respect? That’s a powerful message, and desperately needed. 

But recently, I started to feel like it was missing a piece. Like we were focusing so intensely on celebrating bodies *outside* of the dominant ideal – thinness – that we weren't truly addressing the deeper issues. 

I noticed myself scrolling through Instagram, seeing endless images of “perfect” bodies, and feeling a little… uneasy. It’s not just about aesthetics, is it? There’s this incredibly subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, pressure to conform, to chase a certain look. 

I think we need to broaden our understanding of body positivity to encompass things like disability and the very real mental health struggles that can arise from disordered eating and the constant pursuit of an unattainable ideal.  It’s about recognizing that societal pressures are *powerful*, and they impact everyone differently. 

Maybe true body positivity isn’t just about loving yourself as you are, but also about actively resisting the forces that tell you you *should* be different.  It’s a bigger conversation, and one I’m hoping we’ll continue to have.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps explore a different angle based on these ideas?
