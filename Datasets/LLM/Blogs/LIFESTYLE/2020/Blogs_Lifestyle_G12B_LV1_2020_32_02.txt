>## San Diego Dreaming (and the Quarantine Question Mark)

Okay, so here's a slightly ridiculous thought I've been having: San Diego. A week of sunshine, beaches, and maybe finally seeing the San Diego Zoo. It feels like a lifetime ago that travel was justâ€¦ a thing. Now, even the *idea* of a vacation feels complicated. 

2020, right? We're all navigating this new normal. I'm seriously weighing the pros and cons of a trip. Are the quarantine restrictions manageable? Is it responsible, even? Part of me desperately needs a break, a recharge. The other part is hyper-aware of potential risks. Anyone else wrestling with this travel dilemma? Send me your wisdom! I'm leaning towards sunshine, but cautiously.
