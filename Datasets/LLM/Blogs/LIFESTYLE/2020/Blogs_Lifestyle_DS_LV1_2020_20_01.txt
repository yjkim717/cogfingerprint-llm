Clearing out my home office last spring, I found a drawer full of old phones and cables. It felt like a tech graveyard. Then I saw a local event by Forest Planet—they’d recycle my e-waste and plant trees with every donation. I dropped off my pile, and it hit me: my small act diverted waste from a landfill and helped reforest our planet. In a year of feeling powerless, it was a tangible way to make a positive, global impact.
