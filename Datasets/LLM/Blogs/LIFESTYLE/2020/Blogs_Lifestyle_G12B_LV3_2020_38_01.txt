## The Weight of a Shared Sigh

It's 2020, and Delhi feels… heavy. The lockdown eased, and a strange normalcy settled in, but the virus hasn't vanished. I walk down the street and see so many faces without masks, gatherings happening with little social distancing. It’s unsettling. 

It’s not about blame, really. It’s about a collective fatigue, a yearning for things to be ‘normal’ again. But the weight of knowing the risk is still there, that a careless moment can have such far-reaching consequences, it’s a burden. I find myself holding my breath a little more, a silent plea for everyone to remember – we’re still in this together. A shared sigh, a shared responsibility.
