"When the Aisle Becomes a Frustrating Gauntlet: The Unseen Struggle of Retail Workers"

As I rang up groceries for yet another frazzled customer in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of frustration. Our small grocery store was slammed, and the single employee restroom had become a luxury we couldn't afford to indulge in. The problem wasn't just the lack of time, though - it was the blatant disregard some customers showed for our staff's basic needs. I'd watch as shoppers would stroll into the restroom, take their sweet time, and then emerge without so much as a second thought about the employee bursting to use the facilities. It's not just about being held up; it's about being seen as human. As I navigated the chaos of the retail world, I realized that a little empathy can go a long way in making the shopping experience - and our workday - a whole lot smoother.
