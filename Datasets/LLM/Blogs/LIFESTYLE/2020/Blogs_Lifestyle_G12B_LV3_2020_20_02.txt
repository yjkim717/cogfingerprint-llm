## Why Do We Judge So Quickly? (And What Does That Have to Do With Growing Up?)

It's 2020, and honestly, the world feels like a pressure cooker sometimes. Lately, I've been wrestling with something that feels surprisingly relevant to all the chaos: the fundamental attribution error. Basically, it's our tendency to judge someone's actions based on their character, rather than considering the situation they're in. 

As a grad student diving into developmental psychology, I'm trying to understand *why* we do this, especially when we know it's unfair. It’s proving trickier than I thought! Traditional theories focus on how we *change* as we grow, but this bias seems… persistent. Maybe understanding how our brains develop alongside societal pressures can shed some light. It’s a journey, and I’m hoping to share what I learn along the way.
