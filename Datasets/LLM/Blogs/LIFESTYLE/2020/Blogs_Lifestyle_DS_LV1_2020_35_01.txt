Looking back at 2020, when the world slowed down and our homes became our sanctuaries, I found myself dusting off my old hobby: PC building. There was something grounding about piecing together a machine that could last—a quiet rebellion against the disposable tech culture we’d grown so used to.

I remember hunting for parts with care, insisting on an optical drive, much to the amusement of friends. "Who uses discs anymore?" they’d ask. But for me, it was about nostalgia and practicality, a nod to the mix of old and new that defines my life. With a modest $800 budget, I aimed for a balanced CPU/GPU combo, not for hardcore gaming, but for light sessions and daily tasks—a reliable companion for the years ahead.

In that simple build, I found more than a computer; I found a reminder that intentional choices, even small ones, shape a life of purpose and resilience.
