## Leveling Up My Gaming Setup (and My Chill)

Okay, so I finally caved and upgraded to a PS4 Pro! It’s been a blast, but the audio… let’s just say it wasn't cutting it. I'm diving back into gaming after a long hiatus, mostly for some serious relaxation after a chaotic 2020. I'm torn between two headsets: the RIG 500 HS 7.1 and the RIG 500 with Dolby Atmos. 

Casual gaming is the goal here – I'm not a pro streamer. I just want immersive sound without breaking the bank. Anyone out there rocking either of these on a PS4 Pro? Spill the tea! What’s your experience been like? Help a stressed-out gamer find their audio zen!
