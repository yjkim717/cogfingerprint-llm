## The Unexpected Roadblock (and Why It Feels Like Everything Else Right Now)

It's 2020. Need I say more? The year of constantly shifting plans, unexpected curveballs, and a general feeling of… uncertainty. I thought I'd found a little corner of normalcy, a small goal to focus on: getting my driver's license. I’ve been taking driving lessons, and honestly, the actual *driving* part? Not bad! I’m feeling pretty confident. The multiple-choice theory test? Nailed it. 

But then there’s the hazard perception. Ugh. 

I’ve been diligently doing those online mock tests, clicking away at emerging hazards, trying to anticipate the unexpected. Yet, somehow, I consistently bomb it. It's so frustrating. I’m putting in the hours, reading the DVSA guidance, watching videos… and still, I freeze. I miss those subtle shifts, the cyclists appearing from behind parked cars, the pedestrian stepping out. It's like my brain just… blanks.

It feels oddly symbolic, doesn’t it? Like this whole year. You prepare, you study, you *try* to be ready, and then something completely unforeseen throws you off course.  You thought you’d mastered one thing, and suddenly you’re back to square one, feeling a little defeated.

Maybe it's just the pressure. Maybe I'm putting too much weight on this little test when the world feels so chaotic. I'm reminding myself to breathe, to be kind to myself, and to remember that even a failed hazard perception test doesn't define me (or, you know, the state of the world).  Back to the mock tests, I guess. One hazard at a time.
