## Feeling the Burnout? I Found a Tiny Shift That Actually Helped.

2020, right? We all needed a little extra something to keep us going. I was staring down a mountain of work, feeling completely drained, and honestly, a little resentful of my to-do list. Then I stumbled across this idea about "Work Cycles," and it’s been surprisingly impactful.

Basically, it’s about breaking things down. Instead of thinking "finish this massive project," I started scheduling focused 30-minute bursts with short breaks in between. I even created a simple spreadsheet to track it – seriously, don't underestimate the power of a little visual organization! 

It sounds simple, and it is, but that focused time, coupled with those little mental resets, has made a huge difference. Suddenly, work felt less overwhelming, and I actually started *looking forward* to tackling the next cycle. If you're feeling the burnout, give it a try. You might be surprised.
