As I navigated the challenges of 2020, I found solace in the simplicity of healthy cooking. My go-to routine included tossing chicken breasts into the crock-pot with a variety of sauces - think BBQ, buffalo, or honey mustard - and letting the slow cooker do its magic. I also loved whipping up quick fish dishes with a squeeze of lemon and steamed broccoli. These easy meals kept me fueled and focused, even on the most chaotic days. By prioritizing simple, fit meals, I was able to maintain a sense of control and well-being.
