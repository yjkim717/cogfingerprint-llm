As I scrolled through my feeds in 2020, I stumbled upon ilovecreatives' $899 Squarespace course. I was torn - the tutorial videos promised to elevate my lifestyle blogging, but the price tag made me hesitant. Have you ever invested in an online course that pushed you out of your comfort zone? I'd love to hear your thoughts - was it worth the splurge, or did you end up feeling stuck?
