"Adjusting to Life with CPAP: My N30 Journey

It's been six months since I started using a CPAP machine to manage my sleep apnea, and I'm still figuring out the ropes. My ResMed N30 nasal pillow mask has been a game-changer, but I've had my fair share of questions. How do I keep it clean? Are there alternative masks I can try? And, as a side sleeper, will it stay in place throughout the night?

After some trial and error, I've learned to wash the N30 cushion daily and replace it every few months. I've also explored other mask options, like full-face masks, but the N30 remains my favorite. As for side sleeping, I've found that adjusting the headgear and using a pillow that supports my CPAP mask helps. It's not perfect, but it's getting easier. If you're a fellow CPAP user, I'd love to hear about your experiences. Let's navigate this journey together!"
