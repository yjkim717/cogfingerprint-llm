As I navigated the ups and downs of 2020, my YouTube channel became a sanctuary. I made the conscious decision to keep it private from friends and family, and it was liberating. By doing so, I was able to target my content to the audience that resonated with me, without worrying about awkward encounters or judgment. It allowed me to maintain a sense of identity and creative freedom. For me, keeping my channel under wraps was about setting boundaries and being true to my art â€“ a lesson that extended far beyond the digital realm.
