## The Grind & The Glow-Up

Remember 2020? The year the world felt like a paused game? For me, it was all about finding those little achievements to keep momentum going. I dove headfirst into Madden 21, chasing that elusive platinum trophy. Hours melted away in virtual head-to-head battles, a strange kind of solace amidst the chaos. 

It wasn't just about the trophy, though. It was about setting a goal, pushing through frustration, and celebrating small victories. That digital platinum felt like a tiny, tangible symbol of perseverance â€“ a reminder that even in the midst of uncertainty, you could still level up.
