"Disconnected Abroad: The Frustrating Truth About Android Phones"

As I stepped off the plane in Tokyo in 2020, I was excited to explore the city, but my excitement was short-lived. My Android phone, which had been my trusty companion back home, suddenly felt like a relic. I struggled to get a signal, and when I did, it was slow and unreliable. I was frustrated to discover that my phone's lack of global band support was the culprit. It was a stark contrast to my friend's iPhone, which seemed to work seamlessly. It got me thinking - why can't Android OEMs like Samsung provide the same level of carrier support as Apple? It's 2020, and we're still stuck with "world phones" that don't work everywhere. As I navigated Tokyo's streets with a borrowed portable Wi-Fi hotspot, I couldn't help but feel that it's time for Android manufacturers to step up their game.
