It’s 2020, and like many parents, I’m juggling savings goals with the beautiful chaos of raising children. The idea of Coast FI—building a nest egg now so it grows on its own—resonates deeply. It’s not about retiring early, but securing a future while being present today. Yet, the journey feels isolating at times. I’ve been searching for a community, a place to share doubts and dreams with others walking this same tightrope between financial independence and family life. It’s the support, I think, that makes the balance possible.
