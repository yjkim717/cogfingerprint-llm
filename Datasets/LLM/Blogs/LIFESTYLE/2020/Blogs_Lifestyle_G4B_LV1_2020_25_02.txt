**The Quiet Thunder in My Apartment**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Starting a new chapter and suddenly feeling completely overwhelmed. That’s pretty much been my life for the last six months. I adopted Gus, a gorgeous greyhound, right before starting my final year of uni. Honestly, I thought it would be *easy*. A calm, dignified dog to share my tiny apartment with while I buried myself in textbooks. 

Turns out, greyhounds are just… a lot. And living alone as a stressed-out student? A recipe for a serious anxiety spiral. The initial excitement has faded, replaced by a constant juggling act of vet appointments, puzzle toys, and making sure he gets enough exercise. 

There’s a certain stillness to Gus, a quiet thunder, that’s beautiful, but it also highlights my own frantic energy. I’m learning that dog ownership, especially with a breed like this, isn’t just about cuddles and walks. It’s a huge responsibility, a constant commitment. And maybe, just maybe, it’s teaching me a little more about myself too. 2020 has been a year of unexpected lessons, and Gus is definitely one of them.
