>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational tone, set in a 2020 context. I've focused on expanding the idea and adding a personal touch.  I've included a title suggestion as well.

**Title: The Unrealistic Martini: Why We're All Watching (and Maybe Wishing) for a Different Kind of Night**

Remember back in March, when suddenly everyone was an expert on sourdough and Zoom calls? Well, I've been noticing something else during all this extra screen time – the prevalence of straight liquor in movies and TV. Seriously, how many characters in *Ray Donovan* or *Kingdom* casually knock back a glass of neat whiskey like it's water?

It's a cinematic shorthand for toughness, for brooding, for *intensity*. But it’s also… wildly unrealistic.  I mean, I enjoy a cocktail as much as the next person, but the idea of just chugging whiskey? Not exactly my vibe.

Maybe it's because we're all craving a little bit of that heightened drama right now, a little bit of that external intensity to distract from the quiet anxieties of 2020. Or maybe it’s just a comforting, familiar trope. Either way, I’ll stick with my carefully crafted gin and tonic, thank you very much. What about you? What's your go-to drink these days?
