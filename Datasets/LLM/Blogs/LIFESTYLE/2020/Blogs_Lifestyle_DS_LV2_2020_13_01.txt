It’s 2020, and I’ve been thinking a lot about simplicity versus complexity lately—kind of like the WSL debate I stumbled upon. Do we stick with what’s straightforward, or embrace the powerful but intricate? In this chaotic year, I’ve found myself craving the ease of old routines, yet drawn to new, deeper experiences. Maybe balance isn’t about choosing one over the other, but learning when each serves us best. How are you navigating your own trade-offs these days?
