**Reaching for the Stars (and a Better CV)**

Honestly, 2020 felt…weird. Lockdowns, Zoom fatigue, the whole shebang. But amidst it all, I started seriously thinking about my future. As a computer engineering student, I’m obsessed with space – the idea of building things that go *there* is just wild. 

So, I've started tackling some personal machine learning projects, hoping to add some seriously cool CV experience. It’s a bit of a scramble, balancing coursework with coding late at night, but building something tangible feels like a small step towards a bigger dream. Wish me luck!
