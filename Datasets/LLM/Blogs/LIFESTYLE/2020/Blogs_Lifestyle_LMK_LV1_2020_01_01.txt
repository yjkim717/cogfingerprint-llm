"As I sat on my couch in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but think about my Valorant journey. Last season, I was stuck on Plat 3, frustrated with my gameplay. But I didn't give up. I kept practicing, and by the end of the current season, I had climbed all the way to Gold 2. It was a small victory, but it reminded me that with persistence and dedication, I can achieve my goals - both in gaming and in life."
