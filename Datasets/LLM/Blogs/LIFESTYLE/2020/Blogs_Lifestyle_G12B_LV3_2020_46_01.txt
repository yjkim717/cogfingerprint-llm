## The Frustration of Digital Walls (and Minecraft Earth!)

Okay, so I need to vent a little. Anyone else feeling the digital disconnect lately? I’ve been trying to get my son into Minecraft Earth – you know, the augmented reality version? It seemed like such a fun way to blend his love of building with the real world. But we’ve hit a wall. A frustrating, persistent login wall on his iPad Pro. 

We’ve tried everything – resetting passwords, checking Xbox Live status (which, let’s be honest, is a rabbit hole in itself!), even restarting the iPad multiple times. It’s 2020, and I’m battling tech glitches that feel straight out of the early internet days! It’s more than just a game issue; it’s a reminder of how reliant we are on these systems, and how easily they can disrupt even the simplest joys. Anyone else dealing with similar tech woes? Send help (and login tips!).
