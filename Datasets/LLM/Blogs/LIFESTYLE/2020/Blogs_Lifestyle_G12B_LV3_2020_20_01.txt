## More Than Just Old Gadgets: A Little Hope in 2020

It’s been a strange year, hasn’t it? 2020 has thrown a lot at us, and sometimes it feels overwhelming to think about the bigger picture. But this weekend, I found a small pocket of hope at a Forest Planet electronics recycling event. 

Honestly, I was just clearing out a drawer overflowing with old phones and chargers – the usual tech graveyard. But seeing the sheer volume of electronics being responsibly recycled was surprisingly impactful. It’s comforting to know these items aren't ending up in landfills, contributing to pollution. Even better, Forest Planet plants trees for every device recycled, supporting reforestation efforts globally. 

It’s a small act, but it felt good to contribute to sustainability, and a reminder that even amidst everything else, we *can* make a difference.
