"Many new developers get comfortable testing their PHP scripts locally using XAMPP, a personal web server on their computer. A common and crucial question arises: 'Will my PHP files work when I upload them to my actual web hosting company?' The answer is a definitive yes. Professional hosting provides the server environment your code needs to run live on the internet, making your local development site a reality for the world to see."
