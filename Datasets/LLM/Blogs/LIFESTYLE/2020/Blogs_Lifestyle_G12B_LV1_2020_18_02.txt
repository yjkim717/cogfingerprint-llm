## The Quiet Comfort of Stories Told in Sound

2020 has been... a lot. Seeking solace in the usual distractions felt hollow. Then, I stumbled into the world of audiodramas. It’s a surprisingly immersive experience, like tuning into a world solely for your ears. I'm obsessed! Lately, I've been completely captivated by "Bronzeville" and “Video Palace” – both are beautifully produced, ongoing stories that pull you in without needing a screen. There’s something incredibly comforting about letting someone else build the visuals in your mind. It's become my quiet escape, a little pocket of storytelling magic amidst the chaos. Anyone else discovering the joys of audio drama?
