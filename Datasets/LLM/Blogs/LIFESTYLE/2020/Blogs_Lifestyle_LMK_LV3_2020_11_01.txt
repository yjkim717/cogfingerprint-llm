"As I settled into my home office in 2020, I was frustrated to discover that my System76 Lemur Pro's 3.5mm headphone jack wasn't working smoothly with Fedora 32. Static sounds and low volume plagued my listening experience. It was a minor annoyance, but it disrupted my workflow and focus. I realized that it's the little things, like a functioning headphone jack, that can greatly impact our daily productivity and overall sense of calm. A fix would be a welcome relief, allowing me to settle into a seamless work routine."
