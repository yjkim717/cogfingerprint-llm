It’s 2020, and I’m trying to build a website with this fancy overlapping navbar—CSS fighting me at every turn. It’s funny how coding mirrors life right now: everything feels tangled, borders blurring between work and home. I step back, breathe, and realize the beauty isn’t in perfect alignment, but in embracing the messy overlaps. Maybe the best designs, like the best days, come from learning to sit with the chaos and find grace in the imperfect lines.
