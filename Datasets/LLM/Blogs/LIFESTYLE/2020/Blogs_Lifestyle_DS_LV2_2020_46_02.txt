It’s 2020, and I’m dreaming of a Valve Index—my ticket to virtual worlds while stuck at home. But here in Switzerland, it’s not that simple. I thought I’d just pop over to Steam, but no: my free account hit a wall. You need a paid one to even order hardware. So I tried routing it through Germany, dodging shipping restrictions like some digital spy. It felt absurd, this tiny quest in a year of big chaos. But isn’t that life now? Chasing little escapes, finding hurdles everywhere. In the end, it wasn’t just about a headset—it was about reaching for connection, one stubborn click at a time.
