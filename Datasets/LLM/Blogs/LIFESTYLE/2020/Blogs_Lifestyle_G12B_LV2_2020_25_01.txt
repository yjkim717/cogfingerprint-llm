## The Spinning Wheel of Uncertainty

Anyone else feel like 2020 has been one long loading screen? Seriously. I spent a good hour last night staring at a Runescape login screen, my hardcore account stubbornly refusing to let me pick a world. It felt… symbolic.  Like all my plans, all my hopes for the year, were just stuck buffering. 

We’re all trying to choose our “world” right now, navigating uncertainty and change. Some days, it feels impossible to even *get* to the selection screen. Just gotta keep troubleshooting, I guess, and hope the connection comes back eventually. Right?
