**The Day the Gas Leak Changed Everything**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic and everything feeling utterly chaotic, it's easy to lose sight of the small, cringe-worthy moments that actually stick with you.  I've been thinking about one in particular lately – a spectacularly awkward incident that still makes me squirm.

It happened back in February. I was at school, completely zoning out, when a gas leak went off. Not a huge explosion, thankfully, just a really unsettling hissing and a weird, chemical smell.  Amidst the confusion, a girl I’d had a massive crush on suggested we ‘borrow’ some parental permission slips to sneak out for a study session. 

I, in my infinite teenage wisdom, completely blew it. I blurted out my rejection – a clumsy, panicked denial – and instantly regretted it. It felt like a missed opportunity, a tiny, beautiful connection just… vanished. 

Looking back, it wasn't about the gas leak at all. It was about my own awkwardness, my fear of rejection. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest regrets aren’t about grand gestures, but the little, unspoken moments we miss.  Anyone else have a 2020 moment that still haunts them a little?
