It’s 2020, and suddenly my basement is my whole world—my office, my sanctuary, my escape. But there’s an invisible guest here: radon. With COVID already feeding my anxiety, now I’m wondering if the air I breathe at home is a silent threat. It feels like one more thing to worry about in a year full of them.

So, I’m looking into radon mitigation, not just for safety, but for peace of mind. Because right now, my home should be my safe haven, not another source of fear. Has anyone else faced this double worry?
