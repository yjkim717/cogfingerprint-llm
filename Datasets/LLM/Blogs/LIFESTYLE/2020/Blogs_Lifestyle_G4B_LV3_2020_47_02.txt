**Feeling Stuck in the Zoom Blur? Let’s Talk Work Cycles**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a constant blur of Zoom calls and staring at my laptop. Productivity plummeted, motivation vanished – it was a rough patch. I was just… existing, not *doing*. Then I stumbled upon the concept of “Work Cycles,” championed by Ultraworking, and it felt like a tiny spark of hope.

It’s essentially a spreadsheet-based system for structuring your workday into focused blocks, interspersed with deliberate breaks. The idea is to combat that overwhelming feeling of ‘just one more thing’ and actually build engagement. 

I started small, mapping out just two cycles a day, and the difference was remarkable. Suddenly, my work felt less like a slog and more like a series of achievable goals. It’s about reclaiming control, even when the world feels chaotic.  Are you ready to try a little structure and see if it helps you break free from the endless scroll?
