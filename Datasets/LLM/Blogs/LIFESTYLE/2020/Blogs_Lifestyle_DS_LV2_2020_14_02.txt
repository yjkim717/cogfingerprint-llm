The world slowed down in 2020, and so did I. My frantic calendar, once a mosaic of scribbled commitments, went blank. At first, the silence was deafening. But in that quiet, I found a rhythm Iâ€™d forgotten. I started baking sourdough, not because it was trendy, but because the slow, patient process felt honest. I learned that a full life isn't measured by a packed schedule, but by the depth of the moments we choose to fill it with. Sometimes, you need to stop running to remember how to walk.
