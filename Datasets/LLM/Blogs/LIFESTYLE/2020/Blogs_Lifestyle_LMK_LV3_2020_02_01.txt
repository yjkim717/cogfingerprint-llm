"Embracing the Open Road in Unsettling Times: An Alaskan Adventure in 2020. As I set out on my Alaskan road trip during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was met with a mix of excitement and uncertainty. With ever-changing travel restrictions and a heightened sense of caution, I had to be flexible and prepared. Camping under the stars, I found solace in nature's vastness and practiced social distancing with ease. The journey became a reflection of my own resilience, reminding me that even in challenging times, there's beauty to be found in the open road and the great outdoors."
