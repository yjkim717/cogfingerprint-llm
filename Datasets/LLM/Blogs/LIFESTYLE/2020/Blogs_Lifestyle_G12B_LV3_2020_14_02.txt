## Stepping Into the Unknown (and a Whole Lot of Project Plans!)

Okay, 2020 has been… a year, right? But amidst all the chaos, I landed something pretty exciting: a project management role! It’s my first real foray into the world of Gantt charts and critical paths, and honestly, it’s a little daunting. I’m leaning heavily into traditional project management, which feels like a whole new language.

So, I’ve been diving deep, scouring for resources and books to get my head around it all. It’s a reminder that even when you’re excited about a new chapter, preparation is *everything*. Anyone else ever felt that mix of exhilaration and slight panic when starting something completely new? Send help (and book recommendations!) my way!
