## The Quest for That "Just Right" Layer

This year, 2020, has been all about adapting, hasn't it? And that’s really made me think about my approach to… everything. Even my running gear! I realized I was chasing that perfect, single outfit, instead of building a system. Now I'm obsessed with layering. 

It started with a simple question: how to comfortably run through spring, summer, and fall? Shorts and windpants are my go-to for the bottom half, but the top? That’s been a journey. A good base layer is key, obviously. Then, a trusty fleece for those crisp mornings… It's all about flexibility. Finally feeling prepared for whatever the weather throws my way - a small victory in a year that needs them.
