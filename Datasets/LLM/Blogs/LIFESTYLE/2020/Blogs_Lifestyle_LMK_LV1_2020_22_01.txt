"Stuck at home in 2020, I found myself diving down the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole. A link to a subreddit sparked my curiosity, and before I knew it, I was obsessed with Cherry MX switches. As a gamer, I wanted the perfect keyboard to enhance my experience. But with so many options, I was overwhelmed. Should I go for the tactile bump of MX Browns or the clicky feedback of MX Blues? I've been trying out different switches, and it's been a wild ride. Who knew a keyboard could change my daily routine so much?"
