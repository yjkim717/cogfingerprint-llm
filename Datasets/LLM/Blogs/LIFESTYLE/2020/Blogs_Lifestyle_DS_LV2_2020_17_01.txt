Remember those long 2020 evenings? My escape was the neon-drenched streets of Kamurocho in the Yakuza games. Following Kiryu's journey felt like a lifeline, a story of unwavering loyalty when the world felt so distant. It was more than a game; it was a digital companion, reminding me of the bonds that truly matter.
