## The Wig Struggle is Real (and a Cosplay Lesson in Patience)

Okay, let's be honest, 2020 has been a year of challenges, right? And sometimes, those challenges come in the form of a stubbornly refusing lace front wig. I dove headfirst into cosplay this year – a much-needed creative outlet, let me tell you – and quickly realized securing a heavy wig is a *whole* thing.

My first attempt? Spirit gum. It worked… sort of. But then removing it felt like peeling off my skin. Next, in a moment of sheer desperation (and fueled by late-night YouTube tutorials), I tried nail glue. Big mistake. *Huge.* It bonded like concrete. 

Now I'm left with a gorgeous wig and a delicate lace front covered in adhesive residue. The internet is a rabbit hole of cleaning tips, but it's a slow, painstaking process. It’s a humbling reminder that even something as seemingly simple as cosplay requires patience and a willingness to learn. 

Anyone else finding that 2020 is teaching them a lot about perseverance? Send help (and wig adhesive removal tips!) my way!
