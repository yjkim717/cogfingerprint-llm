Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the Valorant summary, set in 2020 and aiming for a conversational, storytelling tone:

It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? 2020 was… a lot. I was completely hooked on Valorant, grinding away and finally hitting Plat 3. It felt *good*. Then, suddenly, a few weeks of just… not playing well? And bam – Gold 2. It was a weird, frustrating dip.  Made me realize how easily momentum can shift, and how important it is to step back and reassess, not just in a game, but in life too.

Do you want me to tweak this at all, or perhaps write a different version with a slightly altered focus?
