It’s 2020, and I’m trying to keep my work and home life separate, even on one machine. I dove into Hyper-V, setting up an external switch so my host and VMs could connect independently—one adapter for Wake-on-LAN to rouse my workstation remotely, another for my virtual projects. It felt like building digital boundaries, a small act of control in a chaotic year. Sometimes, it’s the little tech wins that help you carve out space, both online and in life.
