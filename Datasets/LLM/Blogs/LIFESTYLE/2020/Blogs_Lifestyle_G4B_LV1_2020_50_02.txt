**Lost in Miniature Worlds**

Honestly, 2020 was… a lot.  Lots of staring at screens, lots of feeling a little lost. But I found a surprising anchor in a completely unexpected place: my dioramas. I’ve always loved building tiny, detailed worlds – little scenes from fantasy novels, or just abstract landscapes.  

Recently, I started obsessing over finding board games that *matched* that aesthetic.  It’s a weird pursuit, I know!  I’m really drawn to tile-based RPGs – the idea of designing a world piece by piece, just like I do with my miniatures. It feels like a way to build something tangible and beautiful, even when the real world felt so chaotic.  Maybe that’s why I’m searching for games that let you shape a world, one tile at a time.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
