Let’s be real—2020 was the year of comfort TV. When my friends teased me for binging Outer Banks (“Isn’t that a chick show?”), I leaned in. Yes, there were wild treasure hunts and over-the-top trailers, but Sarah Cameron’s character? She wasn’t just attractive; she was magnetic. In a year of chaos, finding joy in something so unapologetically fun felt like a small act of rebellion—and self-care. Sometimes, the best escape is the one everyone tells you not to take.
