The hum of the minivan engine was our new normal. In 2020, our grand Alaska road trip wasn't about conquering miles, but about quiet respect. Weâ€™d pull over, watching a distant community from our windshield, wondering about the lives sheltered there. We didn't need to intrude; the vast, empty landscape was the main event. It was a strange, beautiful lesson in connection through distance. Our little van became a cocoon, moving slowly, reminding us that the greatest journeys aren't about where you go, but how you choose to be present along the way.
