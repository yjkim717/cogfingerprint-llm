**The Tightrope Walk of Worry**

Remember 2020? It felt like a perpetual state of “what if?”  I was staring at a text from my daughter, confirming she’d finally moved into her college dorm, and a wave of…everything… washed over me. Relief, yes, but immediately followed by a sharp, insistent anxiety. 

Do I drive up and see her? Just *be* there, a comforting presence after months of video calls? But then the news was still screaming about COVID, and the thought of exposing her, or worse, bringing it home to my own family, felt like an unbearable risk. 

It wasn’t a logical decision, not really. It was a gut feeling, a deep-seated maternal concern battling against a very real fear.  I felt like I was walking a tightrope, balancing my love for my child with a fierce protectiveness of everyone I held dear. 

That feeling – that constant, low-hum of uncertainty – it’s something I still recognize sometimes.  It’s a reminder that motherhood isn’t about grand gestures, but about navigating the quiet, insistent anxieties that come with loving fiercely and wanting only the best for those we care about.
