As I navigated the airport in 2020, I noticed United Airlines was making the switch from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. I hope this change won't disrupt my travel routine, especially with rideshare pickups. A seamless transportation experience is crucial for a stress-free journey. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that United's new terminal will maintain the convenience I'm used to, making my travels smoother and more enjoyable.
