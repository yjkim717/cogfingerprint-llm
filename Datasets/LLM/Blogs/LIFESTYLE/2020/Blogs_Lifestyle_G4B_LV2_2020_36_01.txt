**The Silent Struggle of Signal**

Remember 2020? It felt like *everyone* was glued to their phones, desperate for a connection. I was too. I’d just gotten a shiny new Android – a flagship, of course – and was immediately frustrated. It worked great at home, but as soon as I stepped outside, the signal would drop.  

It made me think about something bigger than just my phone. It was about feeling connected, about being able to reach someone when you needed to. I’d watch my friends effortlessly streaming calls on their iPhones, and it felt… unfair.  

It wasn’t just about the phone itself, but the frustrating inconsistency.  That’s when I realized how much we take global connectivity for granted – something Apple seemed to handle with a little more grace back then.  A small annoyance, sure, but it highlighted a wider issue about accessibility and seamless experiences.
