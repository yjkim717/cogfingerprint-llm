## Finding Worlds Within Sound: Escaping into Audiodrama

2020… what a year, right? Between the news and the general feeling of being stuck, I found myself craving escape in the strangest way. Not the visual kind, but something deeper, something *auditory*. I stumbled into the world of audiodrama, and it’s been a revelation.

Shows like *Bronzeville* and *Video Palace* completely hooked me. It’s amazing how much a skilled cast and clever writing can build a world just through sound. There's something so intimate about a good listening experience, isn't there? It feels like a story whispered directly to you.  Anyone else discovering hidden gems in the audio space? I’m always looking for recommendations!
