**The Numbers Don’t Lie (But They’re Not *Everything*)**

Okay, confession time. I got a little obsessed with Strava in 2020. Lockdown meant I was cycling *a lot*, and I started tracking everything – distance, time, and, of course, my heart rate.  I noticed a pretty dramatic drop on the scale after a few weeks, and I was thrilled! 

Then I started reading about it, and it seemed like it was mostly just water weight shifting around. My metabolism was definitely buzzing, burning through carbs like crazy. It was a weird feeling – this immediate, visible change. 

But honestly, the numbers felt… fleeting.  I realised the real joy wasn't just about the weight disappearing, it was about the feeling of freedom and the consistent movement.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best results come from just showing up and enjoying the ride, not obsessing over the stats.
