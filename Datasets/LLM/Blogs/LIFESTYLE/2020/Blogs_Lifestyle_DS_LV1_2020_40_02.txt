It’s 2020, and I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit scrolling through endless feeds—some social, some far less wholesome. I realized my relationship with porn and fapping had become a reflex, not a choice. It wasn’t about morality; it was about feeling drained, distracted, and disconnected.

So, I decided to step back. Not for some mystical "superpowers" from retaining sperm, but to break a cycle that wasn’t serving me. And the shift was real. I started sleeping better, thinking clearer, and actually engaging with my days instead of just getting through them.

This journey taught me it’s not about demonizing natural urges—it’s about recognizing when they turn into something that holds you back. For anyone feeling stuck in a similar loop, sometimes the bravest thing you can do is press pause.
