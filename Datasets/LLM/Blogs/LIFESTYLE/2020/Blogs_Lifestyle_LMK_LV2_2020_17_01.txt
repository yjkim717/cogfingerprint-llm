As I sat immersed in Yakuza Kiwami 2 on my PC in 2020, I couldn't help but wonder: what's next? Will we finally see Yakuza games 3-6 make their way to PC? The thought of diving back into Kamurocho with Kiryu and Haruka is exhilarating. As I navigated the neon-lit streets, I realized that sometimes, the games we love can inspire a new appreciation for life's simple pleasures â€“ like a quiet night in, lost in a virtual world.
