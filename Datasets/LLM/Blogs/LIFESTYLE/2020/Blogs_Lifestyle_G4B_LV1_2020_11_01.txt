**The Ghost in the Headphones**

It’s funny how little things can throw you off. Last year, I was really enjoying my System76 Lemur Pro – loving Fedora 32 and just generally feeling productive. Then, I started getting this weird static when I plugged in my headphones. It was faint, almost like a ghost in the audio, and the volume was noticeably lower than it should have been.  Troubleshooting felt endless, and it was a frustrating reminder that even the most reliable tech can have its quirks. It’s a small thing, but it highlighted how easily a little disruption can steal your focus.
