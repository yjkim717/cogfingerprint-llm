## The Squarespace Dream & That Price Tag...

Okay, so I'm seriously considering investing in Illovecreatives' Squarespace course. You guys know I've been wrestling with my website design for *months* now. My little creative business needs a proper online home, and Squarespace seemed like the easiest route. But wow, the price tag! It's a significant chunk of change.

I'm at that crossroads where I'm weighing the potential payoff against the initial investment. Has anyone out there actually taken the course? Was it worth it? I'm craving honest opinions â€“ especially in this crazy 2020 landscape where every penny feels precious. Help a girl out!
