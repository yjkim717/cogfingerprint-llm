As I binge-watched Ozark's second season in 2020, one scene caught my attention - Darlene spiking heroin with fentanyl. The show's portrayal felt off, and I couldn't help but think of a Vice video I'd seen earlier that year. In it, experts explained that mixing fentanyl with heroin isn't just about adding a potent substance; it's about creating a specific effect. The show's simplistic depiction didn't sit well with me. It made me reflect on how media representation can influence our perceptions of reality. In this case, the inaccuracy might perpetuate misconceptions about the opioid crisis and distribution networks. As someone who's followed the opioid epidemic, I believe it's crucial to represent complex issues like these accurately. By doing so, we can foster a deeper understanding and encourage more nuanced discussions around the topic.
