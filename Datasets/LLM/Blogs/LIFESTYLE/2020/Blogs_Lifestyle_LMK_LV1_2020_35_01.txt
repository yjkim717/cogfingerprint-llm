As I sat in front of my trusty old PC, I couldn't help but think about upgrading it to something more suited to my daily needs. With a budget of $800, I was on the hunt for the perfect build that could handle everything from browsing to light gaming. I've always been a bit of a tech enthusiast, and reusing old components like my faithful HDD and optic drive seemed like a great way to save some cash. After scouring the web for CPU GPU combos, I started to envision my ideal gaming PC. A budget build that wouldn't break the bank, but still deliver smooth performance. It's funny how a simple PC upgrade can be a reflection of our ever-changing lifestyles. As we navigate the demands of 2020, it's clear that our tech needs are evolving. For me, it's about finding that perfect balance between functionality and affordability.
