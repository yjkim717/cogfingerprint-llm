There I was, two hours into the 2020 Comic-Con virtual meetup, when it happened. A slow, dreaded slide. My magnificent, floor-length lace front wig—the centerpiece of my elven queen cosplay—was staging a rebellion. I’d trusted spirit gum, then in a panic, nail glue. Both had failed me, leaving a sticky, uncomfortable mess.

Staring into my webcam, trying to act regal while my crown of synthetic hair inched toward my eyebrows, I had an epiphany. It wasn't just about the wig adhesive. It was a metaphor for 2020. We were all just trying to hold things together with whatever we had, hoping it would stick. My quest for the perfect cosplay bond suddenly felt a lot like the year itself: a messy, persistent search for something that finally holds.
