## The Speech I Almost Didn't Give (and What It Taught Me About 2020)

Remember 2020? A year ofâ€¦ well, a lot. For me, it was also the year I faced my biggest fear: public speaking. My GCSE English Language speech loomed, and I procrastinated *hard*. Like, Netflix-binging, avoidance-level procrastination. I genuinely believed I was terrible at speaking in front of people. 

But I did it. I somehow cobbled together a speech, practiced (a little!), and delivered it. And you know what? I got the highest grade possible. It wasn't about being naturally gifted; it was about pushing through the anxiety and just *doing* it. 2020 taught me resilience, and that speech? It was a tiny, unexpected victory in a pretty chaotic year. Sometimes, the things we fear most lead to the biggest surprises.
