**The Wig Struggle is Real (and It’s 2020!)**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2020 was *weird*. Between the masks and the Zoom calls, there were still moments I desperately needed an escape. That’s where my cosplay obsession kicked in, and with it, a whole lot of wig-related anxiety. 

I recently dove headfirst into creating a seriously elaborate character for a virtual con, and let me tell you, securing a lace front wig felt like a Herculean task. I was wrestling with spirit gum and nail glue, just trying to get it to *stay* on my head! 

It’s funny, isn't it? Spending so much energy on a temporary transformation, just to feel a little more…free.  I’m still searching for the perfect solution, and honestly, just admitting the struggle feels like a small victory.  Anyone else relate?
