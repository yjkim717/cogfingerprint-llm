### Looking Back to Move Forward

It’s 2020, and if this year has taught me anything, it’s that you can’t hide from yourself in a lockdown. Stuck at home, I started thinking about my past relationships, and I didn’t like the person I saw.

I was the queen of mixed signals. I’d crave physical affection but then build a wall the moment things got real. When conflict arose, I’d use silent treatments or guilt—classic emotional manipulation—to “win.” I was so emotionally unavailable, I might as well have been a ghost.

To anyone from my past who experienced that, I am truly sorry. You deserved better.

But this reflection has a purpose. I’ve met someone who makes me want to be braver, to communicate openly instead of running. The world feels chaotic, but for the first time, my heart doesn’t. This time, I’m committing to the personal change, not just for them, but for the person I finally want to become.
