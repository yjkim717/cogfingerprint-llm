>## The Quiet Revolution I'm Seeking (and Maybe You Too)

It’s 2020, and honestly, I'm craving quiet. Not just quiet in my apartment (though that’s a constant battle with my neighbor’s questionable music choices), but quiet in the *world*. Everywhere you go, it seems, there's a screen vying for your attention. Restaurants, coffee shops, even some bookstores – all bathed in the blue glow of a television. 

I was out with a friend last week, trying to catch up, and found ourselves practically shouting over a game blaring from above. It felt… exhausting. We ended up cutting our time short.

It got me thinking. Why are so many public spaces actively *discouraging* connection? Don't we need more places designed for genuine conversation, for simply *being* with someone? I'd love to see a bar, just once, that proudly advertised "No TVs! Just good drinks and great conversation." 

Maybe this is a weird, pandemic-induced desire for simplicity, but I'm all in. Let’s reclaim public spaces for human interaction. Who's with me?
