As I traveled abroad in 2020, I was frustrated with my Samsung flagship's limited global band support. Unlike my friend's iPhone, mine struggled to roam seamlessly across carriers. It was a minor annoyance, but it highlighted a larger issue - the disparity between Android OEMs and iPhones when it comes to world phone capabilities. Samsung's lack of comprehensive support and features like VoLTE was a letdown. It made me wonder, shouldn't a flagship phone be a truly global device, not just a regional one?
