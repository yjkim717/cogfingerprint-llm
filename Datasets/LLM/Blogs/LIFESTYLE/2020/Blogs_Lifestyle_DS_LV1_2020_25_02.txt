### My Couch Potato Came with an Instruction Manual I Couldn't Read

It’s March 2020, and my new apartment feels incredibly quiet. In a moment of what I can only call "panicked optimism," I decided to adopt a greyhound. I pictured a gentle, lazy giant—a perfect companion for my new, slower-paced life.

Enter Rex.

The shelter wasn't lying about the "couch potato" part, but they failed to mention the volcanic bursts of energy that precede it. In this small space, the responsibility hit me like a ton of bricks. It’s just me. No one to share the 5 AM walks or the "did we play enough today?" anxiety. What if I’m not enough for him?

But here’s the thing about 2020: it’s teaching me to slow down. Rex has forced a routine upon me, a structure I didn't know I needed. As he zonks out on the rug, finally exhausted, I realize we're both just figuring it out, one overwhelmed step at a time. Maybe that’s enough.
