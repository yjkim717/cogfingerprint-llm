## The Year I Stopped Assuming I Knew Everyone Else’s Story

2020. Need I say more? It felt like the world was collectively grappling with… well, *everything*. And honestly, I was too. I was knee-deep in my Master’s, stressing about my thesis – it’s all about how mental health training can help people recognize when they’re making those quick, often inaccurate, judgments about others. The "fundamental attribution error," my professor called it – assuming someone's behavior is entirely about *them* and not the circumstances they're facing.

It was fascinating academically, but it really hit me personally this year. I realized I was doing it *all the time*. The cashier who seemed grumpy? I’d automatically think they were just a negative person. The friend who cancelled plans last minute? I’d feel a pang of annoyance, assuming they didn’t value our time.

Then, 2020 happened, and the sheer weight of what everyone was dealing with became undeniable. The pandemic, the social unrest… it was a lot.  Suddenly, those "grumpy" cashiers were likely worried about job security, my friend was struggling with family illness, and *I* was battling anxiety about the future.

It’s been a slow shift, but I'm trying to pause before jumping to conclusions. To remember that everyone is navigating their own complex story, and I likely only see a tiny, surface-level piece of it. It's a daily practice, but it's making me a more empathetic friend, a more understanding neighbor, and honestly, a less stressed-out human.  And maybe, just maybe, it's a tiny step towards a kinder world.
