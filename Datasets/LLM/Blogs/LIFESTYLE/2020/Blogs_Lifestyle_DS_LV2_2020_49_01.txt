Sipping my morning coffee here in Dubai, the view from my balcony is a stark contrast to the life I left behind. It’s 2020, and while the world feels like it’s paused, my finances are a whirlwind of activity across three different countries. I used to think a single budget was complicated, but try juggling separate pots of money in multiple currencies.

I remember staring at exchange rates, feeling my stomach drop with every fluctuation. My savings were back home, daily life was here in Dirhams, and a small investment was quietly sitting in Euros. It felt like I was trying to herd cats. That’s when I finally got serious with a budgeting tool and created distinct budgets for each currency.

The relief was immediate. Suddenly, I could see the whole picture. I wasn’t just guessing anymore; I was strategically planning. It taught me that financial clarity isn’t about restricting yourself—it’s about building a foundation so solid that no matter which way the currency winds blow, you know you’re secure. It’s the ultimate freedom in a global life.
