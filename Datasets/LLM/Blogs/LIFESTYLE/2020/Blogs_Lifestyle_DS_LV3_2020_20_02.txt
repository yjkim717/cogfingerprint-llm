It’s 2020, and I’m in my tiny apartment, halfway through my master’s in developmental psychology. I’d always assumed that certain cognitive biases—like the fundamental attribution error, where we blame people’s character instead of their circumstances—were just baked into us. Resilient, unchangeable.

Then, I started mental health training. Suddenly, I wasn’t just studying frameworks; I was living them. I caught myself pausing before judging a friend’s sharp text, wondering what stress they were under instead of assuming the worst. It hit me: maybe growth isn’t about erasing our biases, but building new lenses to see through them.

In a year that’s tested everyone’s patience, this shift has been my quiet anchor. We’re all works in progress, learning to grant each other—and ourselves—a little more grace.
