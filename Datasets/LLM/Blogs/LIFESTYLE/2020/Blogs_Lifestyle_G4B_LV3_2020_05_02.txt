**The Quiet Struggle of a Growing Obsession**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a little planted tank can become such a consuming interest. Late 2020, with the world feeling… uncertain, I found myself utterly absorbed in perfecting my aquarium. Specifically, the CO2. It felt ridiculously complicated, a tiny, frustrating puzzle. 

I was battling stubbornly slow plant growth, obsessing over CO2 diffusion and hob intake – basically, how to get the bubbles *just* right. I dove headfirst into DIY solutions, experimenting with airstones and chasing that elusive sign of micro bubbles. It was a surprisingly meditative process, really. 

There’s something grounding about watching tiny bubbles rise, a visual representation of a problem being addressed.  It mirrored the anxieties of the year – a small, contained challenge where I felt, at least momentarily, like I had some control.  Ultimately, it wasn’t about the perfect tank; it was about finding a little quiet focus amidst the chaos.
