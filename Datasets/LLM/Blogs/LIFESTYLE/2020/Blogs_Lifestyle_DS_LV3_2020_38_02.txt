In the quiet isolation of 2020, I found myself scrolling through old messages late one night. A simple “thinking of you” from a friend I hadn’t spoken to in months lit up the screen—and something shifted. That small gesture, a flicker of connection in a disconnected year, became an anchor. It reminded me that even in loneliness, we are not truly alone. Someone, somewhere, cares. That knowledge kindles a quiet hope. It teaches patience—not everything has to be solved today. And it makes me believe that when we can gather again, our connections will be deeper, our conversations richer. The future feels less daunting when you carry that certainty in your heart.
