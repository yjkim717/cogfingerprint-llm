It’s 2020, and I’m supposed to be building miniature worlds on my iPad Pro with Minecraft Earth. Instead, I’m staring at the same “Signing In…” screen, day after day. I’ve reset my Xbox Live password, restarted the app, even tried a different Wi-Fi—nothing. Two weeks of this digital limbo, and I’m left wondering: is this a sign? Maybe the universe is telling me to step away from the screen and just go outside. Sometimes, the glitches in our tech reveal the glitches in our habits.
