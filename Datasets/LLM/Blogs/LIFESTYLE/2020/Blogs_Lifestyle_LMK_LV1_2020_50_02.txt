"As I sat surrounded by my latest diorama creations in 2020, I began to wonder - what if I could bring these intricate, handmade worlds to life in a more interactive way? I've always loved board games, but they often lack the immersive quality of a well-crafted diorama. I'm drawn to RPG-style games, with their rich storytelling and dynamic gameplay. I started experimenting with combining my dioramas with a tiled board, creating a unique fusion of art and play. I'm curious - what other hobbyists are out there exploring similar fusions, and what styles or formats have they found success with?"
