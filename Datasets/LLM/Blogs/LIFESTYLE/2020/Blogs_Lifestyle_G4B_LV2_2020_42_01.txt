**The Frustration Loop**

2020 felt like one long, low-grade frustration, didn’t it? I was completely stuck in a loop – trying to achieve a ridiculous trophy in Madden 21. Seriously, I just wanted to play a game without someone rage-quitting every five minutes. It mirrored something bigger, though. 

It’s easy to get caught chasing perfection, right?  Trying to win at everything, only to be met with… well, people who just don’t want to play fair.  It made me realize I needed to find joy in the process, not just the outcome.  Maybe that’s a lesson we all need to learn sometimes.
