**The Weight of a Messy Mix**

Remember those early days of 2020? Everything felt…off-kilter. Uncertainty was the air we breathed. It made me think about Darlene Snell from *Ozark*, and a strange, unsettling connection popped into my head. The show depicts her haphazardly mixing fentanyl with heroin, prioritizing a quick fix over any semblance of safety. 

It wasn’t just about the drugs, though. It felt like a metaphor for how we sometimes approach our own lives – grabbing at solutions without considering the consequences, rushing into things without a solid plan.  We’re all striving for some kind of “distribution” – success, happiness, a sense of control – but are we really ensuring it's balanced, equitable, and, most importantly, *safe*? 

Darlene’s recklessness highlighted a dark truth: sometimes, the most urgent desire – to get something done, to feel something – can lead us down a path of deliberate harm. It’s a reminder to slow down, to seek informed approaches, and to prioritize a thoughtful, measured approach to everything we do.
