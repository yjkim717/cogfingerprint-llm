Okay, here’s a reflective blog post, aiming for around 174 words and a conversational tone, inspired by the Kubernetes/Raspberry Pi idea, set in 2020:

**Rebuilding My Digital Garden**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a tiny project can suddenly feel like a whole new direction. Late 2020, I was drowning in notifications, scrolling endlessly, and feeling utterly disconnected. My digital life felt… chaotic. So, I started small. 

I began building a little ‘digital garden’ – a collection of self-contained projects, mostly using Docker containers and, surprisingly, a tiny Kubernetes cluster on a Raspberry Pi 4. It felt absurd at first – deploying complex applications on a miniature computer! But the process of setting up networking, figuring out storage, and wrestling with K3s was strangely meditative. 

It’s not about building some grand empire. It's about taking control, breaking things down into manageable pieces, and understanding how they fit together. Like carefully tending a garden, each container is a plant, and the cluster is the soil.  It’s been a surprisingly grounding experience, a little rebellion against the constant digital noise.  Maybe that's what I needed all along.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
