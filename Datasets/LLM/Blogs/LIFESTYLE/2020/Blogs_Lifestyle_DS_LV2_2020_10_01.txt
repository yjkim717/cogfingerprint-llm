It’s March 2020, and my phone won’t stop buzzing.

Another notification. I sigh, expecting a news alert or a work email. Instead, it’s a Reddit badge update from r/stopdrinking—a community that’s been my lifeline. I didn’t ask for this. In a world suddenly shrunken by lockdowns, my screen was already a source of anxiety. Now, even my safe space was adding to the noise.

I remember feeling a strange mix of frustration and validation when Reddit staff acknowledged the glitch and turned it off. It was a small thing, but it mirrored a bigger lesson I was learning in those quiet, uncertain days: not every update deserves my attention.

My real progress wasn’t in digital badges, but in the quiet moments—the mornings I woke up clear-headed, the nights I chose tea over temptation. The notifications stopped, but my resolve didn’t. Sometimes, the most empowering choice is to silence the noise and just listen to yourself.
