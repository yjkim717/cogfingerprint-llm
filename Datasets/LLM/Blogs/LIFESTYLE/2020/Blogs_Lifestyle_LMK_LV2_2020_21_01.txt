"Obsessed with Outer Banks? I'm not ashamed to admit it. As a fan of the Netflix show, I've faced criticism that it's a 'chick show.' But in 2020, I'm unapologetically loving this treasure hunt-filled drama. The show's mix of adventure, romance, and complex characters resonates with me. It's more than just a guilty pleasure - it's a reflection of our pop culture landscape, where complex storytelling and diverse characters are finally taking center stage."
