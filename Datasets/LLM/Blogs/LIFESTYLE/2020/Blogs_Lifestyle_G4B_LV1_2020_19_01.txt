**Remembering the Lumber Blues of 2020**

It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? 2020. We were all trying to figure things out, and honestly, the price of lumber was a surprisingly stressful part of that. I was desperately trying to plan a deck build, and the Home Depot prices… wow. Comparing them to screenshots I’d found on the Wayback Machine from 2017 was a brutal exercise in nostalgia. 

Suddenly, a project that seemed totally achievable just a few years prior felt impossibly expensive. It really made me think about priorities – about how much we’re willing to spend on things that, while nice, aren’t *essential*.  I ended up postponing the deck, and honestly, it forced me to appreciate the simple things, like spending time outdoors without needing a fancy new structure.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, waiting is worth it.
