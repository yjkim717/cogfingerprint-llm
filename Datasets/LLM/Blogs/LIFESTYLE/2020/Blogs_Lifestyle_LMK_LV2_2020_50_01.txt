As I sipped my morning coffee in 2020, I couldn't help but think about how our daily routines were forever changed by the pandemic. With the world shifting to a more digital landscape, I found myself reevaluating my own habits. I started taking long walks, practicing yoga, and cooking new recipes. It was a challenging time, but it also brought a sense of calm and clarity. As I looked out the window, I realized that sometimes it's the unexpected disruptions that lead us to discover a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
