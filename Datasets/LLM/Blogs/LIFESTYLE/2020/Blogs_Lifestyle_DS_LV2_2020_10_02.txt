### The Unexpected Comfort of a Rosebud Motel

It’s 2020, and if you’re anything like me, you’ve been doing a lot of… sitting. A lot of thinking. For those of us on a path of recovery and personal growth, this year has felt like being thrown into the deep end without a lifeguard on duty. My usual anchors—meetings, coffee with a sponsor, the simple act of being in a room with other people—suddenly felt distant or virtual.

So, I did what I’ve learned to do in shaky times: I retreated into books. I revisited the dog-eared pages of my recovery bibles, finding new meaning in familiar words. I also escaped into sci-fi epics, which felt strangely fitting for a world that had started to feel like a dystopian novel itself. But my most unexpected teacher this year didn’t come from a page. It came from a screen, from a little town called Schitt’s Creek.

On the surface, it’s a show about a wealthy family losing everything. But at its heart, it’s a masterclass in what I’ve been struggling to practice: radical acceptance and the dismantling of shame.

Watching the Rose family—initially so full of pride and pretension—slowly, awkwardly, and hilariously learn to be vulnerable with each other and their community was like a mirror held up to my own journey. David Rose, in his iconic sweaters and with his walls firmly up, showed me that it’s okay to be a mess. His journey to accept love, to believe he was worthy of it without having to be “fixed” first, hit me right in the chest.

In a year where I’ve felt isolated in my sobriety, this show reminded me that growth isn’t a solitary pursuit. It happens in the messy, shared spaces of human connection. It’s in admitting you need help, in saying you’re sorry, and in learning to love the imperfect, unglamorous parts of yourself and others.

Schitt’s Creek didn’t teach me how to stay sober, but it gave me a beautiful, warm-hearted model for how to build a life worth staying sober for. And in 2020, that felt like a genuine gift.
