**The Quiet Rage of the Restroom Line**

Honestly, 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic and everything else, I was just trying to keep my head above water working at the local grocery store. But there was this tiny, simmering frustration that built up, and it centered around something surprisingly simple: the employee restroom. 

It wasn’t a huge deal, I get it. But when customers would linger, using it for way longer than necessary, creating a ridiculous line, it just felt… disrespectful. As a retail worker, my breaks were precious, and those long waits felt like a constant, low-level annoyance. It wasn’t about being rude; it was about recognizing the unspoken burden we carried.  It’s a small thing, but it highlighted a bigger issue – a lack of consideration for those working to keep things running.  Just a thought for a strange year.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps adjust the tone or focus on a specific aspect?
