The world slowed down in 2020, and so did I. Stuck at home, my old keyboard’s mushy keys became a daily frustration. I decided it was time for an upgrade, but the choice was overwhelming—clicky Blue switches for that satisfying clatter, or the quieter, tactile Brown ones?

With stores closed, I couldn’t just walk in and test them. So, I ordered a small switch tester online. Each press became a tiny decision, a small act of control in a chaotic year. It wasn’t just about finding the right click; it was about crafting a small piece of my new, home-bound world, one keystroke at a time.
