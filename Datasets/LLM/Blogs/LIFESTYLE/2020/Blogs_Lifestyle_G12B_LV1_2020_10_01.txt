## The Quiet of Unfollowing

It's funny, isn't it, how seemingly small things can highlight bigger shifts? Lately, I’ve been feeling… overwhelmed. Not in a dramatic, crisis-level way, but just a constant low hum of *too much*. And it hit me the other day while scrolling through Reddit.

I stumbled across a thread in r/stopdrinking, a community I’ve admired for its raw honesty and support. They were battling a weird Reddit notification glitch, a feature that kept throwing up badges and alerts. It felt like a symbol, honestly. All this digital noise, constantly vying for our attention. 

Someone suggested temporarily removing the badges – a tiny act of decluttering. And it got me thinking. What if I applied that same principle to my own life? I started unfollowing accounts, muting notifications, consciously choosing to engage less. It's been surprisingly quiet. And in that quiet, I’m actually *hearing* myself again. 2020 has been a year of needing stillness, and maybe, just maybe, it’s starting with a simple unfollow.
