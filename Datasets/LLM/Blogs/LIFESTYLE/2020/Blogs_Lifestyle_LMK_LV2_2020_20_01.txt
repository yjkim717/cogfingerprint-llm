As I dropped off my old electronics at Forest Planet's recycling event last weekend, I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing I was supporting reforestation efforts. In 2020, it's refreshing to see companies prioritizing sustainability. The event was a great reminder that small actions, like responsible e-waste disposal, can contribute to a more eco-friendly lifestyle. I'm inspired to make more conscious choices.
