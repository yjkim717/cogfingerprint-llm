Remember those chaotic 2020 days when cooking felt like another chore? I discovered my crock-pot was a lifesaver. A simple chicken dish simmering all day filled the apartment with the most comforting aroma. On busier nights, Iâ€™d whip up tilapia with a squeeze of lemon and some steamed broccoli, a meal that felt light yet completely satisfying. Even a quick snack of hummus and veggies became a mindful moment. It was a year of finding joy in the simple, nourishing rituals of home.
