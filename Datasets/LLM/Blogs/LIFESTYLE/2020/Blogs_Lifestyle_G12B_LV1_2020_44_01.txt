## The Unexpected Joy of Retro Gaming in a Pandemic

Remember 2020? The world felt…stuck. I was definitely feeling it. Scrolling endlessly wasn't cutting it, so I dusted off my old VisualBoyAdvance emulator. Suddenly, I was back in the world of Pokemon Emerald, a ROM hack I’d always wanted to try. 

It’s been surprisingly therapeutic. Hunting for rare Pokemon, tweaking things with cheat codes (yes, I confess!), it’s a low-stakes escape. There's a satisfying simplicity in mastering a virtual world when the real one feels so chaotic. It’s a small joy, a digital comfort blanket, and a reminder that sometimes, the best solutions are the ones we’ve already known.
