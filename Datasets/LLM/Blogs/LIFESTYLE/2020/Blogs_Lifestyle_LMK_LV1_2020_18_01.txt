As I juggled work-from-home chaos in 2020, I worried about my 2-year-old's screentime. I sought out educational YouTube channels to limit exposure while fostering learning. Channels like Sesame Street and PBS Kids became lifesavers. I also explored kid-friendly streaming services. It was a balancing act, but with the right content, I felt more at ease, giving my little one a healthy dose of screen time with a side of education.
