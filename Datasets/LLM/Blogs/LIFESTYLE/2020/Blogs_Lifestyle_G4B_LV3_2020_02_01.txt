**Alaska Dreams in a Masked World**

2020 felt… different, didn’t it?  Suddenly, the biggest adventure was figuring out how to *safely* explore.  I found myself daydreaming of an Alaska road trip – a chance to breathe fresh air and disconnect, but also to prioritize the well-being of everyone.  The idea of finding those small, open communities, tucked away amongst the vast wilderness, felt incredibly appealing. 

It wasn’t about ticking off landmarks, but about connecting with a quieter pace, a slower way of being.  Camping under the Alaskan stars, practicing social distancing – it felt like a hopeful, if cautious, step towards rediscovering what truly matters.
