Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the summary and keywords, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and a 2020 context. I've tried to capture the essence of the original summary while expanding on it and adding a personal touch.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: Finding Light in the Dark: Shame, Schitt's Creek, and the Slow Climb Back**

It’s 2020. Need I say more? The world feels… heavy. And sometimes, when the news cycle is relentless and the days bleed into one another, the weight settles deep, right into the places we try to keep hidden. For me, that’s often landed squarely on the shoulders of shame.

Recovery isn’t a linear path, is it? It’s more like a tangled vine, sometimes flourishing, sometimes choked with weeds. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with some particularly stubborn ones. Old patterns, familiar anxieties… and that ever-present whisper of “not good enough.”

I stumbled upon Brené Brown’s *Daring Greatly* a few weeks ago, and honestly, it felt like a lifeline. I’d heard the buzz, of course, but actually *reading* it, really letting the concepts of vulnerability and shame sink in… it was transformative. Brown’s work validated so much of what I’ve been feeling – the discomfort, the fear of judgment, the urge to just disappear. It reminded me that feeling vulnerable *isn’t* weakness; it’s courage. It’s showing up, even when you’re terrified of falling.

And then, almost as a balm to the heavier stuff, I started watching *Schitt’s Creek*. I know, it sounds silly, right? A sitcom about a wealthy family losing everything and having to move to a small town? But it’s so much more than that. It’s about finding joy in the unexpected, appreciating the simple things, and building genuine connections. The Roses’ journey, from entitled and disconnected to genuinely caring and contributing members of their community, is surprisingly inspiring. It’s a beautiful reminder that gratitude can bloom even in the most unlikely of places.

These two seemingly disparate things – a deep dive into vulnerability and a feel-good sitcom – have unexpectedly become my anchors. They’ve helped me navigate the uncertainty of 2020, and the ongoing journey of recovery. It’s a slow climb, this sobriety thing, but I’m finding that embracing vulnerability and seeking out moments of joy, even small ones, makes the ascent a little less daunting. And a lot more worthwhile.

What are *your* sources of light these days? I’d love to hear about them.
