### The Unexpected Joy of Building My Own Sanctuary

It all started with a pile of computer parts on my kitchen table in the summer of 2020. As the world outside seemed to spin off its axis, I found myself obsessing over processor specs—Ryzen 3600 or Intel 10400? Which motherboard wouldn’t let me down? It felt trivial, but it became my anchor.

I wasn’t just building a PC for video transcoding and the occasional game. I was, without realizing it, building a new corner of my world. While I stressed over GPU pairings and watched Handbrake encoding tutorials, I was carving out a space of pure focus. In a year of endless uncertainty, this project had a clear goal, a definite finish line.

When I finally pressed the power button and it whirred to life, it was more than a machine. It was a testament to creating something with my own hands amidst the chaos. That tower on my desk now represents a quiet victory—a small, self-made sanctuary of control and capability in a time when both felt in desperately short supply.
