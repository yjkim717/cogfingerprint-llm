raveled through the skies recently, and a little question popped into my head. Delta's Comfort Plus – is it really worth it? I’d heard whispers of elevated service, especially with First Class getting some nice complimentary upgrades. On those longer hauls over 900 miles, those little snacks and drinks can make a *huge* difference. Anyone else been pondering the comfort versus cost equation lately? It's all about maximizing those travel moments, right?
