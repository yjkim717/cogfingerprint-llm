>## The Quiet Hum of Simplicity

It’s funny, isn’t it, how much we chase convenience? Lately, I've been wrestling with that very idea, specifically in my little planted aquarium. I was looking at all the fancy CO2 setups – regulators with solenoids, timers, the whole shebang. Then I realized… do I *really* need all that?

I'm trying to embrace a little more simplicity these days. 2020 has been… a year, hasn't it? The constant connectivity, the relentless pace – it’s exhausting. So, I opted for a manual shutoff valve instead. No need for an outlet, just a simple twist to control the CO2. 

It’s a small decision, but it feels significant. A tiny rebellion against the need for constant automation. Maybe simplifying the tank is a metaphor for simplifying life. A little less noise, a little more intentionality.
