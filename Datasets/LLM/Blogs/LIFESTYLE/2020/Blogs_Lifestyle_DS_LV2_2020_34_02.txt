It’s 2020, and my PS4 Pro has been my escape hatch. Lately, though, I’ve been thinking about sound. My old headset is fine for casual play, but I’m eyeing the RIG 500. It’s not a huge splurge, but is it worth it? The real debate is stereo versus Dolby Atmos. Do I need that immersive, cinematic experience, or is simple stereo enough for my laid-back sessions? It’s a small upgrade, but in a year of big changes, sometimes the little comforts make all the difference.
