Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 270 words:

**Finding My Galaxy in the Quiet**

It’s 2020, and honestly, the world felt…a lot. Like a perpetually brewing storm. For me, that storm was tied to a whole lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms, and a hefty dose of shame layered on top. It took a while, a *really* long while, to finally recognize that I needed to step out of the chaos and find a different kind of orbit. 

That’s where the weirdest, most wonderful shift began. It wasn’t a dramatic, overnight transformation, more like slowly building a spaceship – one carefully chosen book and episode at a time. 

I’ve been diving deep into self-help lately, and Brené Brown’s *Daring Greatly* has been a real lifeline. The core idea – that vulnerability isn’t weakness, but strength – has been a total game-changer. It's like she’s given me permission to actually *feel* things without immediately judging myself for it. 

And then there’s ‘Schitt’s Creek’. Seriously. This delightfully absurd sitcom has been a constant source of comfort. The Rose family’s spectacularly dysfunctional dynamic, their messy attempts at connection, it’s just…pure, unadulterated joy. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? Finding solace in the most unexpected places. It’s like I’ve built my own little space opera – a galaxy of small, intentional choices designed to nurture my well-being. 

I’m not claiming to have all the answers, or even that I’m *good* at this sobriety thing yet. But finding these pockets of peace, these moments of connection with stories and with myself, feels like the most important adventure of all.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the blog post (e.g., expanding on the Brené Brown connection, or delving deeper into the 'Schitt's Creek' influence)?
