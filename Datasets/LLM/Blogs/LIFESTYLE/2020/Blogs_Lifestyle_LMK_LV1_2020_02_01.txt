"As we navigated Alaska's breathtaking landscapes in our trusty minivan, camping under starry skies, we found a sense of freedom. But 2020's pandemic reality had us checking local guidelines and travel restrictions at every turn. We prioritized social distancing, yet still connected with the local communities we met along the way. The vast wilderness and open roads became a balm for our pandemic-weary souls. Our Alaska road trip was a reminder that even in uncertain times, adventure and connection are still within reach â€“ you just need to be flexible and informed."
