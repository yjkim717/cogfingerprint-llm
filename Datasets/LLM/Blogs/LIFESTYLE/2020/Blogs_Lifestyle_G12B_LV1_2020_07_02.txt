>## The Quest for the Perfect Burner (and a Little Bit of Kitchen Zen)

It's funny how a simple skillet can spark a whole home upgrade project. I’ve been happily using my 15-inch Lodge cast iron for years – searing steaks, baking cornbread, the whole nine yards. It's a workhorse, truly. But recently, I realized my current stovetop just *isn't* cutting it. My burner is too small; the skillet barely fits, and even less so when I'm trying to maneuver it.

This year, 2020, has been about appreciating the small joys and finding comfort in routine. And for me, cooking is a big part of that. So, I’ve embarked on a quest: a new 36-inch electric or induction stovetop with a burner big enough to embrace my beloved cast iron. It feels silly, perhaps, to invest so much thought into something so specific. But it’s about more than just the skillet. It's about creating a kitchen space that supports my love of cooking and brings a little more ease – and a lot more sizzle – to my everyday. Wish me luck!
