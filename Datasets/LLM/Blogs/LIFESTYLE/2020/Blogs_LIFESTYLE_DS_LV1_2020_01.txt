**The Static of 2020**

2020 was the year of noise. The constant buzz of bad news, the hum of anxiety. It felt like my life was stuck on a bad frequency.

Ironically, my new laptop’s headphone jack seemed to agree. Every song, every podcast, was laced with a frustrating static, a low-volume hiss of discontent. It was a tiny, persistent annoyance that perfectly mirrored the year’s background dread.

Then, I remembered the Bluetooth headphones buried in a drawer. The moment I paired them, the static vanished. The silence was crisp, the music, clear. It was a small victory, but a profound one. It reminded me that sometimes, the solution isn't to fight the noise, but to find a new way to connect. A little wireless grace can go a long way.
