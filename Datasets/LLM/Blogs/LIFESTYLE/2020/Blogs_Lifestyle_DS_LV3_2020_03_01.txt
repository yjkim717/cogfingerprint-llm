There’s something grounding about facing a crisp 40-degree morning in 2020, a year that demanded so much from us. I’ve learned that my three-season upper body system is a lot like life right now: it starts with a solid base layer of routine. Adding just enough warmth for comfort, but not so much that I can’t move freely. It’s a delicate balance, this dance between staying sheltered and remaining ready for whatever comes next.
