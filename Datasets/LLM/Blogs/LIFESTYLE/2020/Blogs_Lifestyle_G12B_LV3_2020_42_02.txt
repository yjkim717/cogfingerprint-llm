## The Unseen Cost of Holiday Cheer (and a Really Full Restroom)

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? We’ve all been navigating unprecedented challenges, and sometimes, the little things just pile up and become monumental. I wanted to share something that’s been weighing on me, a tiny frustration that speaks to a much larger issue: the unseen cost of holiday cheer, particularly for those on the front lines.

I recently spoke with a retail worker, and their story genuinely floored me. Imagine this: the holiday rush is in full swing, the store is packed, and they’re working tirelessly to help customers find the perfect gifts. But there's only *one* employee restroom. And customers, understandably wanting a quick break, are hogging it. 

This seemingly small detail spiraled into a situation where the worker couldn't access a bathroom, couldn't eat their lunch, and frankly, was dealing with increasingly unsanitary conditions. It highlighted a disconnect – a lack of consideration for the people *making* the holiday season possible. 

It’s a reminder that behind every smiling face serving you a latte, or wrapping your presents, there's a human being with needs and limitations. Let's all try a little harder to be mindful, to extend a little grace, and to remember that kindness, like a clean restroom, goes a long way.
