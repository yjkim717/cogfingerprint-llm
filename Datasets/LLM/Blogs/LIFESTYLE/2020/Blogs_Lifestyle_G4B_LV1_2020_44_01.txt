Honestly, 2020 felt a lot like endlessly scrolling through a ROM hack – searching for a perfect version of something. I was obsessed with optimizing my little corner of life: a better work-from-home routine, healthier habits. It was exhausting trying to find the “master code” for a consistently happy day. Sometimes, I got so fixated on the cheat codes (like perfectly timed workouts), I forgot to just *play* the game.  It’s a reminder to appreciate the imperfect, beautiful mess of real life.
