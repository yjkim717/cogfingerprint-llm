I yearned for a change, just like a website craving a CSS makeover to overlap elements and create a stunning navbar with Bootstrap. I decided to shake things up and rediscover my passions. By embracing the new normal, I found solace in simple pleasures and learned to navigate the grey areas, much like debugging CSS code to achieve the perfect design.
