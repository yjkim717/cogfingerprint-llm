## The Speech That Shocked Me (and Maybe Saved My Sanity)

Remember 2020? Everything feltâ€¦ precarious. For me, that anxiety manifested in *serious* procrastination. My English GCSE speech loomed, and I genuinely dreaded it. Public speaking? My worst nightmare. I put it off, week after week. Then, suddenly, it was *here*. 

I stumbled, I mumbled, I definitely blushed. It wasn't polished. But somehow, against all odds, I got the top grade. Looking back, maybe that raw, slightly panicked delivery connected with the examiner. Or maybe, just maybe, finishing *something* amidst the chaos of that year felt like a small victory worth celebrating. It taught me that sometimes, just showing up, even imperfectly, is enough.
