>## The Unexpected Pivot & Finding My Center

It’s funny how life throws curveballs. Just a few months ago, I was happily settled in my marketing role, feeling pretty secure. Then, 2020 happened, and everything shifted. Suddenly, my company restructured, and my position was eliminated. Panic set in, naturally. 

But then, a friend mentioned a project management opening – a field I'd always been vaguely interested in. It felt like a leap, especially with the traditional, structured approach they were looking for. I'm diving in headfirst, grabbing every book and resource I can find. It's challenging, definitely a learning curve, but strangely… grounding. Finding structure amidst the chaos of 2020? Maybe this unexpected pivot is exactly what I needed to regain a sense of control and direction.
