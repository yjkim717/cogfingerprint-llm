### The Unlikely Plugins of a Pandemic Year

Remember when we thought the word “plugin” only belonged to tech geeks? I sure did. But as 2020 unfolded, my world shrank to the four walls of my apartment, and I started seeing my own life in those terms. I was the core system—a little shaky, a little outdated—and I desperately needed some new plugins to function.

My first attempt was the "Sourdough Starter" plugin. It promised integration with a simpler, homesteader lifestyle. It was messy, required constant attention, and for a glorious week, my kitchen smelled like a rustic bakery. But ultimately, it wasn’t compatible with my actual life. The starter died, and I felt a strange sense of failure.

Then I tried the "Live-Stream Yoga" plugin. This one was better. It didn’t demand perfection, just showing up on the mat. It integrated beautifully with my need for structure and my creaky lower back. It was a plugin that actually enhanced the core system, reminding me to breathe when the news feed felt like a denial-of-service attack.

I’ve learned this year that we’re all running our own unique architecture. We’re trying out new habits, new hobbies, new ways of thinking, seeing what’s compatible with our soul’s backend. Some plugins we’ll keep, and others we’ll deactivate with a quiet thank you for the lesson. The goal isn’t a flawless system, but one that’s resilient, curious, and ultimately, our own. What plugins are you running these days?
