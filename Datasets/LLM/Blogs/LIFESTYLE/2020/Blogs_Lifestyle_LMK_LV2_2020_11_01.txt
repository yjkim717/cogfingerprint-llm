"As I sat in my home office in 2020, trying to focus on a podcast, I was frustrated by the static sound and low volume coming from my System76 Lemur Pro's 3.5mm headphone jack. It was a minor annoyance, but enough to disrupt my workflow. Troubleshooting the issue on Fedora 32 became a mini-adventure. It made me realize how much we rely on our devices working seamlessly. A faulty headphone jack was a small glitch, but it was a reminder to appreciate the little things that make our daily lives smoother."
