## Airport Shuffle & Letting Go of the Familiar

Anyone else feeling a little disoriented by all the change lately? Just saw United's moving from Terminal 2 to 3 at Phoenix Sky Harbor! It’s a small thing, I know, but it got me thinking about how often we cling to routines, even the ones as simple as which terminal we land in. It’s a gentle reminder to embrace the unexpected, right? 2020 is already proving to be full of surprises!
