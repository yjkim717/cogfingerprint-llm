As I navigated my new role in 2020, I realized that being a project manager isn't just about ticking boxes - it's a lifestyle. I devoured books on effective PM practices and sought out seasoned pros for advice. What I learned was that success hinges on adaptability, clear communication, and a willingness to learn from failure. These lessons have been invaluable, and I'm excited to continue growing in this role.
