### The Unlikely Joy of a Raspberry Pi

So, 2020 happened. The world shrunk to the size of my apartment, and my social calendar was replaced by a sourdough starter I named ‘Bready Kruger’. In the quiet chaos, I found myself staring at a credit-card-sized computer—a Raspberry Pi—that had been gathering dust on my shelf.

My initial plan was ambitious: build a mini-Kubernetes cluster, migrate my Docker containers, the whole techie shebang. I spent hours wrestling with networking, VLANs, and trying to get an NFS share to behave. It was frustrating. I’d hit a wall, walk away, and then find my mind drifting back to the problem while washing dishes.

But here’s the thing I didn’t expect. It wasn’t about the success. It was about the *process*. In a year where so much felt out of my control, this little project was a world I could command. A wrong line of code was my fault, and fixing it was my victory. The gentle glow of the Pi’s LED became a tiny, manageable campfire in the vast, uncertain dark.

That cluster never did become production-ready, and ‘Bready Kruger’ met a tragic end. But I learned something profound. In our quest for big, life-altering hobbies, we forget the quiet satisfaction of building something small, just for the sake of it. My Raspberry Pi didn’t solve 2020, but it gave me back a sense of agency, one frustrating, wonderful command line at a time. Sometimes, the smallest projects make the biggest impact on your headspace.
