Switching from my PC to the PS4 Pro in 2020 felt like a cozy step back into casual gaming—until I realized my old headset just wasn’t cutting it. I found myself weighing the RIG 500 HS with its punchy 7.1 stereo against the 500 HC and its immersive Dolby Atmos. It’s funny how a simple upgrade can reignite that spark, making those quiet evenings feel like epic adventures. Sometimes, it’s the small investments in our hobbies that bring the most joy, especially when life outside feels so uncertain.
