It’s funny how something as small as a digital badge can feel so meaningful. Back in early 2020, when the world was turning inward, my little "stopdrinking" badge on Reddit became a quiet anchor. Each day it ticked upward was a small, silent victory in a year that felt overwhelmingly loud with bad news.

So, you can imagine my frustration when those random notifications started popping up. My phone would buzz—a flicker of hope for a message from a friend—only to find it was just Reddit tinkering with my badge. It felt like someone was tampering with my personal scoreboard of resilience.

When the platform staff acknowledged the glitch and fixed it, turning off that experimental feature, it was more than a technical fix. It was a reassurance. In a time when so much felt out of our control, this was a small win for our digital sanctuaries. I could finally reset my badge, my little counter of sober days, and trust it to just quietly do its job again. It was a reminder that even our small corners of the internet deserve to be peaceful, consistent, and ours.
