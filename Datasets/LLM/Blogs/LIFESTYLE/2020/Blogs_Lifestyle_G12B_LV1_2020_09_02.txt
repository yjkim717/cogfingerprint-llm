## The Unnecessary Pause

2020 felt like one long, drawn-out sentence, didn't it? So many things left unfinished, hanging. I realized I was mirroring that in my own writing, peppering everything with semicolons. Like I was afraid of letting ideas breathe. Now, I’m consciously choosing to break things up, find the natural flow. Sometimes, a full stop is just…better. Less formal, more honest, feels more *me*. Less pause, more forward.
