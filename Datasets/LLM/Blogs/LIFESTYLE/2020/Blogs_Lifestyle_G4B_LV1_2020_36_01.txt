**The Great Band Battle of 2020**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was a little… glitchy. And my phone was no exception. I’d been stubbornly clinging to my Android, loving the customization, but increasingly frustrated with the patchy global support. I’d travel, excited to use VoLTE for crystal-clear calls, only to be met with a frustrating “no service” message. 

It really highlighted something – Apple just *works* so seamlessly everywhere.  Switching to iOS felt like a breath of fresh air, a reliable connection regardless of where I was.  It wasn’t about being loyal to a brand, it was about a simple, consistent experience.  Maybe it’s time to rethink my priorities, and appreciate the peace of mind that comes with a little less tinkering, and a little more global connectivity.
