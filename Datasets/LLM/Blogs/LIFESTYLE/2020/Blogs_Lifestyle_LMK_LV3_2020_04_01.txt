As I stepped into my favorite local bar in early 2020, I noticed something that made it stand out from the rest - the absence of TVs. At first, I thought it might be a bit dull, but what struck me was how it actually encouraged conversation. Without the distraction of screens, friends and strangers alike were engaging in meaningful discussions, laughing, and genuinely connecting. The atmosphere was lively, yet relaxed, and I found myself having a more enjoyable time with my friends. We weren't competing with sports games or news for attention, and our conversations flowed freely. It made me realize that bars without TVs are not just a novelty, but a catalyst for authentic socializing. By stripping away the distractions, we're left with the essence of what makes going out with friends so special - good company, good drinks, and great conversation.
