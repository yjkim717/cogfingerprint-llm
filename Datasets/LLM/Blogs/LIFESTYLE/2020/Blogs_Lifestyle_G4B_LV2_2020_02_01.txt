**Chasing Wildness, Seeking Connection (2020)**

2020 felt… different, didn’t it?  I remember obsessing over an Alaskan road trip – a desperate craving for wide-open spaces and a break from the constant news. The idea of a camping minivan, miles from anywhere, felt like the ultimate social distancing ritual. 

But it wasn’t just about escape. Honestly, I was also searching for genuine connection.  I wanted to find those small, resilient Alaskan communities that were still open, places where we could respectfully visit and support local businesses. It was a quiet hope – a yearning to rediscover a sense of shared humanity amidst a world pulling apart.
