**A Little Spark in the Dark**

2020 felt…heavy, didn’t it? So many of us were grappling with isolation, a strange kind of loneliness that settled deep. I remember those weeks of simply *waiting*, hoping for a flicker of connection. It’s funny how quickly perspective shifts. 

Recently, something shifted for me. A genuine connection with someone who just *gets* it. It’s not a grand, sweeping romance, but a quiet understanding, a shared laugh, a feeling of being truly seen.  Suddenly, the waiting feels a little less daunting, and a hopeful warmth is spreading through me. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest moments, a little spark can ignite a whole lot of joy.
