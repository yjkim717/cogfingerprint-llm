It’s 2020, and I’m rethinking everything—including my closet. On a crisp autumn hike, I finally understood the magic of layering: a snug base, a trusty fleece, and a puffy jacket ready for the summit chill. It’s not just about staying warm; it’s a lesson in adaptability. In a year of constant change, learning to layer felt like finding balance—prepared for anything, but never weighed down. Life, like the trail, demands flexibility.
