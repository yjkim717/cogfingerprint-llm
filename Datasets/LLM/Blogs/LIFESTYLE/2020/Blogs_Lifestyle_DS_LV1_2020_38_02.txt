There’s a quiet kind of loneliness that settled in during 2020, a feeling I think many of us came to know. But somewhere between the silence and the solitude, I found a flicker of something new: hope.

It wasn’t a loud, demanding hope, but a gentle one. It whispered that this time of waiting wasn't empty—it was a chance to cherish the small things, to learn the shape of my own heart. I’m holding onto the belief that a better morrow is coming, one where I’ll find the deep connections and love I’ve been patiently waiting for. For now, I’m learning to be still, trusting that the wait itself is preparing me for what’s ahead.
