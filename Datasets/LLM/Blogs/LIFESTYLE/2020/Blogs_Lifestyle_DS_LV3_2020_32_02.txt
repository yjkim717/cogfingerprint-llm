The idea felt almost rebellious—planning a week-long escape to San Diego in the middle of 2020’s quarantine. But with travel restrictions in place, I craved a change of scenery to truly recharge. Wandering through near-empty streets, I discovered the city’s quiet, authentic vibe. It wasn’t the bustling vacation I’d imagined, but a peaceful retreat that reminded me how stillness can be just as revitalizing as any adventure.
