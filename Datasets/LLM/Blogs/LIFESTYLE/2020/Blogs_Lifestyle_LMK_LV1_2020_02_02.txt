As I scrolled through Reddit in 2020, I stumbled upon a thread about the Apollo app's awards feature. I realized I wasn't alone in feeling overwhelmed by the numerous awards. I began to wish for a way to categorize or create a favorite list, making it easier to navigate and show appreciation for my favorite creators. A simple feature that could elevate my Apollo experience.
