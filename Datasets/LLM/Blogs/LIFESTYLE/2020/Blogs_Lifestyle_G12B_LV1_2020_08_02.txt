## The Invisible Third Chair at the Table

It's funny, isn't it? How you can build a life with someone, a beautiful, messy, wonderfully *yours* life, and still feel like there's an invisible third chair pulled up to the table. That's been my reality for a while now, and honestly, 2020 has only amplified it.

I’m not talking about a literal third person, though sometimes it feels like it. I'm talking about my partner, Liam's, mother, Eleanor. And I'm talking about the slow, insidious creep of her…well, let's call it *presence* into our lives.

Liam and I have been together for five years. The first couple were blissful, a whirlwind of shared dreams and late-night conversations. We found a cozy apartment, adopted a ridiculously fluffy cat named Winston, and started building a future that felt genuinely *ours*. Then, slowly but surely, Eleanor started appearing more and more.

It wasn't malicious, not overtly. Eleanor is, on the surface, a perfectly lovely woman. Always baking, always offering helpful advice (whether solicited or not), always concerned. But that "concern" often manifested as a subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle, attempt to steer our lives in a direction she deemed "best."

It started with small things. Comments about the apartment – "Don't you think it's a little…small? You should really consider something with a garden." Then came the unsolicited decorating advice ("That rug clashes with the curtains, dear!"), followed by suggestions about our careers ("Liam’s a talented accountant, he shouldn’t be wasting his time with photography…"), and even our social life ("You should really cultivate friendships with *our* crowd, dear, people who understand us.").

At first, I brushed it off. I told myself she was just being a mother, wanting the best for her son. Liam, bless his heart, would chuckle and say, "She means well." And he's right, she does. But "meaning well" doesn't negate the feeling of being constantly evaluated, constantly nudged, constantly having my choices questioned.

2020, of course, threw a whole new level of complexity into the mix. With lockdowns and social distancing, our interactions with Eleanor shifted to video calls. And those calls…they were intense. Suddenly, she was *daily*, checking in, offering advice on everything from our hand-washing technique to the best way to sanitize groceries.  It felt suffocating.

I started to resent the weekly Sunday dinners, the constant stream of texts, the feeling that I couldn't make a decision without considering how it would be perceived by Eleanor.  It wasn't about her, really. It was about me realizing I was losing myself in the effort to navigate this dynamic. I felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells, censoring my thoughts and opinions,
