### Finding My Own Rhythm in a World of Trends

It was the great lockdown project of 2020. With the world on pause, I decided to finally dive into the sprawling world of *Skyrim* mods. I’d heard whispers of this incredible mod called ‘Vigilant’—a dark, epic adventure praised to the heavens. It felt like the perfect escape.

But from the first quest, something felt off. The voice acting was jarringly amateur, pulling me out of the beautifully grim world. The environments felt less like a tribute to *Dark Souls* and more like a hollow copy, lacking the original’s deliberate weight. And as a mage, I was just… steamrolling everything. There was no tension, no need for strategy. The very thing that was supposed to deepen my immersion was shattering it.

It was a small, silly disappointment in a year full of big, real ones. But it taught me something. In 2020, we were all bombarded with “the right way” to use our time—learn a language, bake sourdough, master a game. That mod was someone else’s perfect fantasy, not mine.

So, I uninstalled it. I went back to my own, slightly messy, vanilla-plus playthrough. I stopped chasing the “best” way to play and just played. It was a quiet lesson in tuning out the noise and finding my own rhythm, a skill that felt more valuable than any virtual trophy. Sometimes, the most immersive experience is the one you craft for yourself.
