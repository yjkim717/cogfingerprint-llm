It’s 2020, and I’m trying to log into my RuneScape hardcore account—the one I’ve poured months into. But every time I pick a world, it boots me back to the login screen. I’ve tried everything, even Jagex support. No luck.

It’s funny how a game glitch can mirror life right now. We’re all stuck in a loop, trying to connect, only to be kicked back to square one. Maybe the real challenge isn’t beating the game, but learning patience when the system itself seems broken.
