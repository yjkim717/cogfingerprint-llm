**The Route Less Traveled: Rethinking How We Explore the Web**

Remember 2020? We were all staring at screens, desperately trying to find joy and connection in the digital world. I found myself building increasingly complex single-page applications – beautiful, functional, but… a little exhausting. I started to wonder if all that intricate routing, all those meticulously crafted page transitions, were *really* necessary.

It felt like we were building these elaborate highways, forcing users down a specific path, rather than letting them explore organically.  I’d been wrestling with React, creating these sprawling components, and the more I built, the more I questioned the fundamental assumption: that a linear journey is always the best way to navigate a website. 

Honestly, it felt a bit like a control issue. I was so focused on *how* the user moved, that I was forgetting about *why* they were moving.  In 2020, with everyone craving simplicity and genuine connection, wasn’t it time to shift our focus? 

Now, I’m not saying ditch routing entirely. But I’m advocating for a more fluid, component-based approach – letting users discover features and content through intuitive interactions, rather than predetermined routes.  It's about building a user experience that feels less like a guided tour and more like a genuinely enjoyable exploration.  What do you think?
