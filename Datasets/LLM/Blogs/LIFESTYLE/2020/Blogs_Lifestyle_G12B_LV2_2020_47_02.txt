## Finding My Focus in a Year of… Everything

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn’t it? It was a year of constant shifts, uncertainty, and a whole lot of time spent staring at screens. I found myself battling a persistent feeling of…blah. Like I was *trying* to be productive, but nothing really stuck.

Then, I stumbled across this idea about working in cycles. It sounds simple – breaking down work into focused bursts with short breaks – but it's been surprisingly powerful. I even built a little tracker in a Google Sheet (seriously, don't underestimate the power of a spreadsheet!).

It’s not about magically doing *more*; it’s about doing what I *need* to do, with intention. And honestly, that small shift in approach has helped me feel a little less overwhelmed and a little more…engaged. It’s a tiny victory in a year that demanded a lot. Maybe finding your own rhythm, whatever that looks like, is the biggest productivity hack of all.
