It’s 2020, and my world has shrunk to the size of my apartment. My new System76 Lemur Pro was supposed to be my portal—to work, to friends, to concerts on YouTube. But the headphone jack has other ideas. A persistent static hiss, volume that dips and swells on its own, like a ghost is playing with the dial.

It’s a small thing, but in this year of isolation, it feels symbolic. The direct, wired connection is flawed, unreliable. So, I went wireless. Slipping on the Bluetooth headphones, the silence was pure, the sound perfect. Sometimes, the old ways just don’t work anymore, and you have to cut the cord to find clarity.
