**Building Worlds, Finding People**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of staring at screens. Zoom calls, online shopping, and a desperate need for connection. I’d picked up Minecraft – just to *try* it, really – and was immediately overwhelmed. It’s gorgeous, but so…complex!  I started a small, messy world, mostly just wandering around. Then, through a Discord server, I found a group of genuinely chill players. Building together, exploring, even just chatting – it was a surprisingly grounding experience. It reminded me that sometimes, the best adventures are found not in grand expeditions, but in shared, simple moments.
