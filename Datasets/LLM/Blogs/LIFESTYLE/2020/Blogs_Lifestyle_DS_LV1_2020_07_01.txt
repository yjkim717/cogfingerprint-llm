### The Longest 8.5 Hours

The text came through on a Tuesday. *“Mom, it’s official. I have to move to the isolation dorm.”*

My heart did that familiar, painful squeeze. My daughter, my brand-new college freshman, was alone and sick, 500 miles away. And suddenly, I was faced with the ultimate 2020 parenting dilemma.

My first instinct, a primal one, was to grab my keys, throw a care package together, and just *drive*. For 8.5 hours, I could picture it—the open road, the podcasts, the relief on her face when I showed up with her favorite soup and clean sheets. I could be the mom who swoops in and makes it better. In a normal year, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.

But this isn't a normal year.

The other voice in my head, the one tempered by months of anxiety and news alerts, was louder. *What if you’re asymptomatic and you give it to her? What if you pick it up on the road and bring it back to your husband and son?* The very act of caregiving felt like a potential act of harm.

So, I did what long-distance parents everywhere learned to do in 2020. I became a virtual comfort station. We had a FaceTime date while I “tucked her in.” I ordered groceries for contactless delivery to her isolation dorm. We texted constantly.

It felt woefully inadequate, like trying to put out a fire with a water pistol. But then she sent a photo of the soup and a heart emoji. It wasn’t the hug I ached to give her, but it was a connection. In this strange new world, sometimes love means staying very, very far away.
