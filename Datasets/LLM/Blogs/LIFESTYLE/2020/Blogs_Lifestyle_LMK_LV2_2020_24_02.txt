"Rainy days always bring back memories of my trusty old Ford Fiesta. In 2020, I finally figured out its 'wet start' issue, a problem that had been nagging me for years. It was a lesson in patience and car maintenance. Looking back, those frustrating moments taught me to appreciate the little things - a smooth start on a drizzly morning was a joy. It made me realize how car trouble can affect our daily lives and the importance of staying on top of maintenance."
