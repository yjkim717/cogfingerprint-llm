The rumble of our minivan’s engine was the only constant as we wound through Alaska’s vast emptiness in the summer of 2020. We’d planned this road trip for years, but now it was different. Our itinerary wasn't just about scenic stops, but about which small towns were open to visitors. We carried our negative COVID tests like passports, practicing a new kind of social distancing respect for the local communities we passed through. It was a journey of breathtaking beauty, underscored by a quiet, collective caution that redefined the very soul of travel.
