"Welcoming a New Friend: The Uncharted Territory of Greyhound Care"

As I sat on my couch in the spring of 2020, surrounded by the eerie silence of a lockdown, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. Just a few weeks prior, I'd brought home a sleek greyhound, thinking it'd be a great companion during the pandemic. However, as the days went by, I began to feel overwhelmed. Was I providing enough exercise? Was its diet on point? The more I cared for my new furry friend, the more I realized the weight of responsibility that came with pet ownership. As a student, juggling classes and care duties was a challenge. But as I looked into those big, brown eyes, I knew it was all worth it. Caring for my greyhound taught me patience, empathy, and the value of living in the moment â€“ lessons that extended far beyond the realm of dog care.
