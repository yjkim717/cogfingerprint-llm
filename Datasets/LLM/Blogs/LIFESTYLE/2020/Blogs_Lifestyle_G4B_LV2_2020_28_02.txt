**The Unexpected Fizz: My Ride and a Little Weight Loss**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2020 was… a lot. I was desperately trying to find little pockets of joy, and I rediscovered cycling. I started going for short rides, just to get out of the house and feel *something*. 

And then, something weird happened. After a particularly sweaty ride, I noticed the scale had dipped a little. It wasn’t huge, but it was enough to make me wonder what was going on. Turns out, it was mostly water weight – a quick, temporary loss thanks to all that sweat and a little boost to my metabolism. 

It was a surprisingly satisfying little victory. It made me think about hydration, about moving my body, and about how even small changes can have a noticeable impact. I started tracking my rides with Strava, partly to hold myself accountable, but mostly just to see the miles add up.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best results come from simply showing up.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, or perhaps focus on a slightly different angle?
