**The Year I Almost Burned Out (and How I Learned to Slow Down)**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a relentless sprint. I was diving headfirst into “ultraworking,” convinced more hours equaled more output. I was chasing productivity like it was a runaway train. But by December, I was completely drained – a classic burnout warning sign.

It helped me rediscover motivation and create a healthier work environment.  It reminded me that true productivity comes from balance, not endless hustle.
