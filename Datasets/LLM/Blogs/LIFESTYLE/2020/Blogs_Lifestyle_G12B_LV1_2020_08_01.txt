## The Day My Tomatoes Almost Beat Me

Okay, so, 2020. We all know *that* year. Between the pandemic anxieties and the constant news cycle, sometimes the simplest things felt like a monumental effort. I decided, in a burst of springtime optimism (and a desperate need to feel *productive*), to really get serious about my garden. I envisioned fresh tomatoes, fragrant basil, the whole nine yards.

I spent a Saturday morning out there, digging, weeding, planting… honestly, I went a little overboard. I’m usually a fairly sensible person, but the sunshine and the promise of homegrown goodness just took over. I was out there for hours, really putting my back into it.

Then, suddenly, it hit. A wave of dizziness washed over me, followed by a throbbing headache. And the weirdest thing? A distinct metallic taste in my mouth. It was so bizarre! I stumbled inside, feeling completely wiped out. 

My husband, bless him, rushed over with a glass of water and a worried look. Dehydration, he figured. And he was probably right. I hadn’t been drinking nearly enough, focused as I was on those tomato seedlings. 

It was a good reminder, though. A reminder that even in the midst of all the craziness of 2020 – the lockdowns, the uncertainty – taking care of *myself* was still the most important thing.  A reminder that even a little bit of ambition can get you if you aren't careful.  I’m still enjoying my tomatoes, by the way, but I’m definitely pacing myself in the garden now! And drinking *much* more water. Anyone else find themselves learning life lessons from the most unexpected places this year?
