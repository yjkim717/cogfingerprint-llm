**The Night Shift and My ResMed N30**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of unexpected shifts. Between the pandemic and a new diagnosis, my sleep schedule – and my life – completely upended. That’s when I started using my CPAP machine, and specifically, the ResMed N30 mask. It felt… strange, at first. Like wearing a little spaceship on my face! 

But I quickly learned that it was a lifeline. However, I also discovered a whole new set of challenges – mainly, side sleeping. The mask just wouldn’t cooperate! I spent a lot of nights adjusting, tweaking, and desperately trying to find a comfortable position. 

Cleaning the N30 became a nightly ritual, a tiny act of care for this essential piece of equipment. I was constantly researching the best ways to keep it hygienic, and even looked into alternative masks. It’s funny, isn't it? How a device designed to help you sleep can also become a focal point of your worries. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the small adjustments – a clean mask, a mindful sleep – can make a huge difference in navigating a world that feels constantly in flux.
