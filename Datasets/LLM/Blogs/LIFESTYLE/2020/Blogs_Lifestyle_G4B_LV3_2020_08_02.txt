Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the summary and keywords, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone, suitable for 2020:

**The Weight of Always Being “Right”**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily a good intention can twist into something…heavy? I found myself staring at my phone last year, scrolling through endless articles about self-care, and realizing I was desperately avoiding *my* own self-care.  I was trapped in a loop, and it wasn’t pretty.

It started subtly, a few years back, with a partner who, unintentionally, started leaning on me for everything. Little decisions – what to order for dinner, what movie to watch – quickly morphed into a constant, low-level pressure to *know* what he wanted, to *guide* him. I’d find myself crafting elaborate justifications, meticulously explaining why my suggestion was better, why he was wrong. 

Looking back, it felt…compulsive. Like I needed to be ‘right’ in every little interaction. It wasn't about genuinely wanting to help; it was about proving I was in control.  The keywords kept circling in my head: dependency, manipulation, resentment.  They weren't dramatic accusations, not initially, but a dull, persistent ache. 

2020, with its lockdowns and uncertainty, just amplified it.  Suddenly, *everything* was a source of potential conflict, and I was clinging to the familiar comfort of dictating the terms. I felt utterly exhausted, a constant low-grade anxiety simmering beneath the surface. 

It took a really honest conversation – and a lot of self-reflection – to realize I was building a wall around myself, terrified of vulnerability.  Setting boundaries felt terrifying, like admitting I couldn’t carry the weight of his decisions. But I started small, saying “I’m not sure, let’s figure it out together,” and surprising myself with the relief it brought.  It’s a process, definitely, but learning to let go of the need to be ‘right’ has been the most liberating thing I’ve done for myself this year.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way? Perhaps focus on a specific aspect, or adjust the tone further?
