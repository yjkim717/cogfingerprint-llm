## Terminal Changes & the Little Things That Matter

Anyone else feel like 2020 has been one big shift? Just learned United Airlines is moving from Terminal 2 to 3 at Phoenix Sky Harbor. It’s a small thing, really, but it got me thinking about how even minor travel changes can throw off a rhythm. I’m mostly hoping the rideshare pickup stays easy – those little conveniences make a *huge* difference when you’re already juggling bags and travel stress! Hoping for smooth transitions for everyone.
