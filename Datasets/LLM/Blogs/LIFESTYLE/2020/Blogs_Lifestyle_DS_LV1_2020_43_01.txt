### The Unplanned Route: Finding My Way in 2020

I’ve always been a planner. My life, pre-2020, felt like a perfectly coded single-page application. I had my routes all mapped out: the career URL, the social life URL, the five-year-plan URL. I thought happiness was just a matter of clicking the right navigation button.

Then, 2020 happened. The entire system crashed. The routes I’d so carefully defined led nowhere. My job went remote, my calendar emptied, and the "user journey" I was on simply vanished. I was left floating in a blank space with no address bar to guide me.

At first, it was terrifying. But a strange thing started to happen. Without the pressure of a destination, I began to interact with my life differently. I wasn't navigating to predefined pages; I was just… exploring the components right in front of me. I started baking bread not because it was on a "self-improvement" path, but because the smell of yeast was comforting. I had long, meandering video calls with friends, conversations that didn't have an agenda or an end goal. I read books for the sake of reading, not to check a box.

I realized I had been so focused on the URL—the title and destination of each chapter—that I’d forgotten how to simply experience the story. This year forced me to trade routing for presence. My life isn't a series of perfect, bookmarkable pages anymore. It's a single, ever-changing view, and I'm finally learning to appreciate the rich, unplanned interaction within it. Sometimes, the most meaningful journeys happen when you stop trying to navigate and just let yourself be.
