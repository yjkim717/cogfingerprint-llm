It’s 2020, and I finally tackled that garage cleanout I’d been putting off. Tucked away in a dusty corner was a graveyard of old electronics—phones, a laptop, cords everywhere. Instead of just trashing them, I found a Forest Planet recycling event. It felt good, knowing these items wouldn’t end up in a landfill. Even better, my small act contributed to global reforestation. It’s a simple choice, but it connected my clutter-clearing to a healthier planet. A little effort for a lot of good.
