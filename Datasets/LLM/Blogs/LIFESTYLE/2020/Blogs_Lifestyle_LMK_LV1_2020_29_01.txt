As I sipped my morning coffee in 2020, I stumbled upon an $899 Squarespace course on ilovecreatives.com. I'm torn - is it worth the investment for my lifestyle blog? I've always struggled to make my site visually stunning. The tutorial videos promise to unlock Squarespace's full potential. Has anyone taken this course? I'd love to hear your thoughts - should I take the leap and elevate my online presence?
