"Raised on Hollywood, I once believed liquor was always gulped straight from the bottle. But as I grew older, I noticed a stark contrast between on-screen drinking habits and real-life social gatherings. In 2020, as we navigated lockdowns and virtual happy hours, I realized that Hollywood's portrayal of liquor consumption was far from reality. In truth, we savor our drinks, often with mixers and ice, and enjoy the company of others. It's time to redefine the narrative around drinking culture and reflect on our own habits â€“ and perhaps, pour a more nuanced glass."
