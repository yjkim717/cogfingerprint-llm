The open road called, a solo escape from Seattleâ€™s four walls. With the world on pause in 2020, I craved quiet. Just me, my car, and a coastline three hours away. No itinerary, just the hum of the highway and the profound peace of having a stretch of beach entirely to myself. Sometimes, the best company is solitude.
