**Boxes, Tests, and a Whole Lot of Worry**

Okay, 2020. Just… wow. It feels like a lifetime ago, and yet, the sheer strangeness of it all still hits me sometimes. Right now, I’m mostly just trying to breathe. My daughter, Chloe, has been hit with a nasty bug – a fever, chills, the whole shebang. And, of course, the inevitable question hangs in the air: COVID? 

Adding to the chaos, she’s officially started college, a whole new life in a new city. It’s amazing to see her blossoming, but honestly, it’s also terrifying. I’m juggling unpacking boxes, trying to keep her comfortable, and desperately hoping for a negative test result. 

There’s a weird mix of pride and anxiety – celebrating her independence while simultaneously clinging to the familiar comfort of home. It’s a strange new normal, this hybrid of distance and worry.  I’m learning that letting go doesn’t mean you stop caring, it just means you learn to care from a little further away. Sending Chloe (and myself!) all the good vibes.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps explore a different angle?
