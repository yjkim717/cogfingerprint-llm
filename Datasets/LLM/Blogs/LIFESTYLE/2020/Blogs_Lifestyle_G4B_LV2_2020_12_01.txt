**The Year Sleep Changed Everything**

It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? 2020. The uncertainty, the masks… and the relentless fatigue. I was battling sleep apnea, and honestly, it felt like another layer of chaos. Then came the CPAP machine – a ResMed N30 with a surprisingly comfy nasal pillow mask. 

Initially, side sleeping was a disaster. Leaks, adjustments, frustration. But I started experimenting, really listening to my body. Now, I’ve found a routine that works. And cleaning that tube? A surprisingly mindful little ritual. It’s a small victory in a year of big changes, a reminder that even in the midst of disruption, finding comfort and control is possible.
