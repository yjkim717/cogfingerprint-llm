Stepping into my first formal project management role in 2020, I craved guidance. As I navigated this new terrain, I discovered that preparation was key. I devoured recommended books and resources, from classic project management texts to online forums. This foundation helped me stay focused and adaptable amidst the challenges of a rapidly changing year. It was a valuable investment in my professional growth, and one that I continue to build upon.
