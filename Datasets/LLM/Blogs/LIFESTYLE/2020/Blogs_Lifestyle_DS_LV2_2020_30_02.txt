You know, 2020 was the year my old routines crumbled. Stuck at home, I finally tackled that dusty box of photosâ€”my own personal time capsule. There was me in 2015, grinning after my first 5k, full of a future that felt limitless. Looking at that guy now, I don't miss the frantic pace. This forced pause taught me that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is just stop, remember who you are, and quietly begin again.
