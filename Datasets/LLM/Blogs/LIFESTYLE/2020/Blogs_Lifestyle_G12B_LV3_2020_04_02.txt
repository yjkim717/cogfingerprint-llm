## Inheriting a Mess: Finding My Footing (and Helping My Team Do the Same)

It's 2020, and honestly, everything feels like an inheritance these days, doesn't it? We're inheriting anxieties, uncertainties, and sometimes, like me, a team dynamic that needs a serious reset. I recently stepped into a Scrum Master role, and let's just say the previous leadership left… well, let's call it room for improvement.

Punctuality was a suggestion, engagement was optional, and the core Scrum practices felt more like a box-ticking exercise than a guiding philosophy. It was overwhelming, to say the least. My initial instinct was to *fix* everything, to impose order. But I quickly realized that wasn't the answer.

This isn't about dictating; it's about fostering ownership. We're working on rebuilding trust, establishing clear meeting etiquette (seriously, showing up on time!), and rediscovering the *why* behind Agile. It’s a slow process, filled with honest conversations and a lot of listening. It’s a reminder that true productivity isn’t about rigid rules, but about creating a space where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute. And that, I’m learning, is a journey worth taking.
