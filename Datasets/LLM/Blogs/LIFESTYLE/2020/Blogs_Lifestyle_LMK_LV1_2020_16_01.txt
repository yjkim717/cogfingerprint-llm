As I sat in my dorm room in 2020, surrounded by textbooks and half-finished coding projects, I realized I needed a change. Studying computer engineering was challenging, but I felt like something was missing. I was fascinated by the space industry and its potential for innovation. So, I decided to start working on side projects that combined my passion for space with my skills in machine learning and AI development. It wasn't easy - balancing coursework with personal projects was tough. But I was determined to enhance my CV and stand out in a competitive job market. As I dove into projects like asteroid detection using neural networks, I felt a sense of purpose and excitement. It was exhilarating to see my skills being applied to real-world problems. My side projects became a thrilling outlet, and I was hooked. They not only boosted my confidence but also opened doors to new opportunities in the space industry.
