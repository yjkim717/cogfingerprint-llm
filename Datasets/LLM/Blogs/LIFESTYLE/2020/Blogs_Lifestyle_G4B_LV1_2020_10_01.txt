**The Shiny Distraction & the Quiet I Needed**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020. A year of lockdowns and anxiety, and yet, I was still battling my own little war – a struggle with drinking. I found a surprising amount of support in r/stopdrinking, and honestly, the community felt like a lifeline. 

But then came the Reddit notifications. Specifically, the little badge system and the new flair options. It felt… overwhelming. Like another layer of pressure to *optimize* my recovery, to track every step.  I remember spending way too much time tweaking my flair, chasing those digital rewards. 

The moderation team, bless their hearts, noticed it too. They temporarily shut down a testing feature and, in doing so, gave me something invaluable: quiet. It was a reminder that sometimes, the best thing you can do for yourself is simply *stop* scrolling, stop chasing shiny distractions, and just breathe.
