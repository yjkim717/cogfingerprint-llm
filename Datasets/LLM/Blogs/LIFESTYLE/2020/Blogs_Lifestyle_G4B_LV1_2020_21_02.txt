**The Quiet Channel**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020 was all about shouting into the void, but I’ve been doing the opposite. I launched a little YouTube channel – a tiny corner dedicated to vintage watch repair – and I’ve been deliberately keeping it hush-hush from everyone. My family, my friends… they just wouldn’t *get* it. It’s about building a small, dedicated audience, one who genuinely appreciates the details.  It’s a slower pace, but honestly, it feels a lot more peaceful.
