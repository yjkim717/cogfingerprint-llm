It’s 2020, and I’m sitting in a quiet café in Lisbon, trying to make a video call back home. My sleek, top-tier Android flagship—the one I paid a premium for—has full bars, but the call just won’t connect with VoLTE clarity. Frustrated, I glance over at my friend’s iPhone; she’s already deep in conversation, crystal-clear and uninterrupted.

I’ve always loved Android for its innovation and choice. Brands like Samsung promise the world with their "global" devices, but when you’re actually globetrotting—or even just navigating different networks—the experience can be hit or miss. Missing band support here, patchy VoLTE there. It’s like buying a first-class ticket but finding your seat doesn’t recline.

Meanwhile, Apple seems to have cracked the code on universal connectivity. Their world phones just work, seamlessly, wherever you are. It makes me reflect: in a time when staying connected feels more vital than ever, why should we have to choose between cutting-edge features and reliable communication? Maybe true luxury isn’t just about specs—it’s about simplicity that travels with you.
