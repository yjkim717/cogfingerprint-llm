**The Weight of a Good Habit**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was trying to pull us under. I was desperately clinging to my daily RuneScape sessions – a tiny bubble of order in a chaotic year. Specifically, hardcore mode. It was frustrating, repeatedly failing to select a world, and really highlighted a strange truth: sometimes, the most rewarding things are the ones that stubbornly resist. 

Like building a good habit, it took persistence.  It wasn't about the game itself, but the quiet satisfaction of overcoming a challenge.  It taught me that a little focus, even when everything else feels overwhelming, can make a difference.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post with a different focus?
