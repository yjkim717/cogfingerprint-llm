## The Cosmic Steel of Everyday Life

Remember back in 2020, when everyone was suddenly obsessed with foraging for…well, *anything*? I was deep into Forager, that little game where you expand your island and craft everything imaginable. There was this constant hunt for legendary gems and cosmic steel – resources that felt genuinely scarce. You'd see another player online bragging about finding one and feel this pang of…envy? Determination?

It got me thinking about real life. We're all constantly "foraging" for those rare things: a quiet evening, a moment of genuine connection, a feeling of calm in the chaos.  Like those cosmic steel deposits in the void of the game, they’re not always easy to find. But when you do stumble upon them, or even better, *create* them, they’re worth hoarding. Worth savoring.  Maybe that's the secret: actively seeking those small, precious resources, even when the world feels relentlessly busy.




Hope this fits the bill!
