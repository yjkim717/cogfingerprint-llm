**The Weight of a Board**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was…expensive. I was in the midst of building a small outdoor bench, a little project to bring some calm to the chaos. But then I looked at the lumber prices – specifically the pressure-treated stuff – and nearly choked. Comparing them to what I’d paid back in 2017 felt surreal. It wasn’t just the cost; it was a reminder of how the pandemic had shifted everything.  Suddenly, even a simple weekend project felt like a weighty decision, a small reflection of a world turned upside down.
