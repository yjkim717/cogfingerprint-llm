**The Day My Garden Almost Took Over**

It’s funny how seemingly simple things can suddenly feel… alarming, right?  It was late spring 2020, and I was *really* trying to embrace the “slow living” trend. I’d finally started a small vegetable patch – a tiny rebellion against the constant Zoom calls and anxieties of the year. 

I was weeding, enjoying the sunshine, when it hit me: a sudden, dizzying wave.  Followed by this weird, sharp metallic taste in my mouth, and a throbbing headache that just wouldn’t quit.  I honestly panicked. Was this some weird, new pandemic symptom? 

Looking back, I realize it was probably just overexertion and a bit of pollen overload. But that day, it felt like my little garden had taken over, hijacking my senses and leaving me utterly disoriented. It was a stark reminder that even the most wholesome activities can have unexpected consequences, and sometimes, listening to your body is the most important thing.
