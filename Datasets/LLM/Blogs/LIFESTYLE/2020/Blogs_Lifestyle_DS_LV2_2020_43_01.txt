### The Unseen Routes of 2020

It’s funny, isn’t it? For years, my life felt like a well-designed single-page application. I had my little navigation bar up top: Work, Home, Social, Gym. A click, a smooth transition, and I was in a different part of my world, but never truly leaving the familiar screen of my routine.

Then 2020 happened, and the router broke.

Suddenly, there was no seamless journey to a bustling coffee shop or a friend’s crowded living room. The familiar paths were gone, replaced by one, static view: the four walls of my apartment. At first, it felt claustrophobic, like being stuck on a webpage with no links, no "back" button, no way forward.

But that’s when I started noticing the hyperlinks I’d always overlooked.

The route to my balcony became a journey to a bird sanctuary I never knew existed. The path to my kitchen became a culinary adventure, a chance to finally understand the alchemy of sourdough. A video call wasn’t a poor substitute for a party; it was a deeply intentional route to a friend’s heart, free from the usual noise.

I’m not a developer, but I’ve learned a fundamental lesson about routing this year. It’s not about the fancy animations between big destinations. It’s about the value of the destination itself. This year forced my internal map to redraw itself, finding profound depth in the smallest of coordinates. The user journey got a lot quieter, but in the silence, I finally heard the most important voice: my own.
