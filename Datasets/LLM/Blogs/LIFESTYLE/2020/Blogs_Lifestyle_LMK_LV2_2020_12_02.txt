"Finding Balance in a Quarantine World: My Journey to a Dual-Purpose PC"

As I sat stuck at home in 2020, I realized my old PC just wasn't cutting it anymore. With the pandemic raging on, I found myself juggling work-from-home responsibilities with gaming and creative pursuits. I needed a machine that could keep up. I started researching a new PC build, diving deep into motherboard comparisons, CPU and GPU options. I wasn't just building a gaming PC, I was building a tool for design and productivity. The process was therapeutic, a welcome distraction from the chaos outside. As I crafted my perfect PC, I discovered a sense of balance and control. It was a reminder that even in uncertain times, we can create something that brings us joy and helps us thrive. My new PC became a symbol of resilience, a tool to fuel my passions.
