>## The Quiet Joy of Digital Companionship

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2020, when the world felt so…disconnected, I found a surprising sense of connection in a blocky digital world. I’d always dabbled in *Minecraft*, but recently I realized I wasn't interested in the hardcore survival stuff. I just wanted to build, explore, and maybe chat while watching the sun set over a pixelated landscape.

Finding a group to do that with felt harder than I thought! So many servers were hyper-competitive, full of complex rules and demanding builds. Eventually, I stumbled upon a small Discord group of folks just looking for casual company. Now, evenings are spent building silly houses, mining for diamonds, and sharing stories – a quiet, comforting counterpoint to the anxieties of the year. It’s a simple joy, and a reminder that connection can be found in the most unexpected places.
