**The Weight of a Frozen World**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was…stuck. Even my RuneScape hardcore account became a frustrating microcosm of that feeling. I couldn’t select a world – just a persistent, infuriating loading screen. Hours spent troubleshooting, emails to Jagex support… it was a surprisingly intense battle.
