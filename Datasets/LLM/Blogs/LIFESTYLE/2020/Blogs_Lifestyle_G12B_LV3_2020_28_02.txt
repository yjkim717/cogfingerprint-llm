## The Numbers on the Scale & the Feeling in My Legs: A Cyclist's Weight Loss Puzzle

Okay, so I’ve been cycling pretty consistently these past few weeks – trying to squeeze in rides whenever I can, especially with everything feeling a little…uncertain in 2020. And I’ve noticed something interesting: the scale dips after a good ride. Which is great, right? But it got me thinking. What *actually* makes that number go down?

It’s not just about “calories burned,” is it? I started digging a little, and it turns out there’s a lot more to it than that. A big chunk of that initial weight loss is probably water. Cycling really works up a sweat, and you’re losing fluids. Then there’s glycogen – that stored energy in your muscles. When you cycle, your body uses that up, and glycogen holds onto water, so as it depletes, you lose more water weight.

And then, of course, there's the fat metabolism piece. That’s the long game, the sustainable change. It’s the slow burn, the consistent effort that builds endurance and, eventually, shifts the composition of your body. 

Honestly, it’s a fascinating puzzle. It reminds me that weight loss isn't always a straightforward equation. It’s a complex interplay of fluids, energy stores, and the gradual, rewarding process of building a healthier, stronger me. And right now, feeling strong on my bike is a pretty good win, regardless of what the scale says.
