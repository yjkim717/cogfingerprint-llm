That final Madden 21 trophy on my PlayStation taunted me all through 2020. My gamer tag was so close to platinum, but every time I started winning, my opponent would quit. It became a strange life lesson in that isolated year. I was chasing a digital reward, yet the real frustration was this shared inability to see things through. We were all so quick to disconnect, both in the game and, it often felt, in life itself.
