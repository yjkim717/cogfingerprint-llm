There I was in 2020, my trusty 2004 Fiesta refusing to cooperate with the morning drizzle. That stubborn wet start and rough idle felt like a metaphor for the year itselfâ€”everything required a clumsy, sputtering warmup before it settled into a rhythm. It reminded me that some days, you just have to sit with the discomfort, let the engine of your own spirit run a little rough, and trust that smoother running is just ahead once things dry out.
