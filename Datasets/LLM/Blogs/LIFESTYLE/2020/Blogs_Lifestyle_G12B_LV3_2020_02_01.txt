## Alaska Dreams & Distanced Horizons (2020)

Remember when "travel" felt…complicated? 2020 certainly threw a wrench in everyone's plans. I found myself staring at maps, craving adventure, but wrestling with the reality of a pandemic. Alaska, with its vast landscapes, suddenly seemed like the *perfect* escape – a place where social distancing felt almost natural.

The research began: Was it open? Safe? Could I actually pull off a road trip that prioritized both exploration and responsibility? It felt like a delicate balance. But the idea of breathing in that crisp Alaskan air, of witnessing glaciers and wildlife with a little extra space around me… it was a powerful motivator. Maybe, just maybe, a distanced adventure was exactly what we all needed.
