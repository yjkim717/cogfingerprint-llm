>## The Quiet Worry in the Basement

It's funny how things you never think about suddenly become all-consuming. This year, for me, that's been radon. I know, right? Sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. But a recent home inspection revealed levels in our basement hovering between 5 and 9 pCi/L – significantly higher than what’s considered safe. 

Suddenly, my mind is racing. Is it in the air I breathe downstairs? Are we putting our family at risk? We’ve always loved our basement – a cozy space for movie nights and the kids' play area. Now, it feels...different. 

We’re scheduling a consultation with a mitigation specialist next week. Honestly, just researching it all is a little overwhelming. It’s a stark reminder that even in our seemingly safe, comfortable home, unseen dangers can lurk. It’s a weird, quiet worry, but one I’m determined to address – for peace of mind, and for the health of those I love.
