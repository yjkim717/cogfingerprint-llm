## The Quiet Joy of Miniature Worlds (and Why I Need a Game)

It's 2020, and let's be honest, the world feels…big. Overwhelming, even. So, I've been retreating into smaller spaces. Specifically, the miniature worlds I’ve been building. For years, I’ve been crafting little dioramas - tiny shops, overgrown ruins, fantastical landscapes – all painstakingly handmade. It started as a way to de-stress, a meditative process of shaping clay and arranging pebbles. 

Recently, though, I’ve been thinking about what to *do* with these little worlds. They feel…incomplete. I want them to be more than just pretty displays. I've become obsessed with the idea of a tabletop RPG, something playable, built around this aesthetic. A tiled board, maybe? A game where these handcrafted assets aren’t just scenery, but integral parts of the story. 

It's a big project, but in a year that’s felt so out of control, the prospect of creating something tangible, something playful, is unbelievably appealing. Maybe building a game is exactly what I need to bring these little worlds to life.
