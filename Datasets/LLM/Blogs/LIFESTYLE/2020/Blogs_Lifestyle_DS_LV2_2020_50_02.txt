In the quiet of 2020, my dining table became a sanctuary. With the world on pause, I rediscovered the simple magic of board games—the tactile weight of pieces, the shared laughter over a dice roll. But I craved something more immersive, something that felt alive.

That’s when I started building handcrafted dioramas to pair with RPG-style games. Each tiny tree, each tiled cobblestone, told a story. It wasn’t just about winning; it was about creating worlds where we could lose ourselves together. In a year of distance, these miniature landscapes bridged the gap, turning quiet evenings into grand adventures. Sometimes, the smallest worlds help us make sense of the biggest ones.
