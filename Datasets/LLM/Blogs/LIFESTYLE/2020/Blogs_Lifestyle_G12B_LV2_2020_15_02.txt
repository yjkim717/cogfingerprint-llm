## The Last-Minute Miracle (and a Lesson Learned)

Remember 2020? Everything felt… suspended. For me, it was also the year of the dreaded GCSE English speech. I *procrastinated*. Hard. Like, leaving-it-to-the-night-before hard. The topic? Let’s just say it sparked some heated debate. 

Honestly, I was a nervous wreck. But somehow, I pulled it together. And you know what? I got a distinction. It wasn't about brilliance, it was about showing up, even when terrified and ridiculously behind. It taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, just *doing* is more important than perfect planning. Still working on that planning part, though!



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
