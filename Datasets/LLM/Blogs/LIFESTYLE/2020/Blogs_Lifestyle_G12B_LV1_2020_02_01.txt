>## The Open Road & a Whole Lot of Hand Sanitizer

Remember 2020? The year the world felt like it held its breath? For me, it unexpectedly became the year I rediscovered the quiet joy of a road trip. Stuck in place felt…suffocating. So, with a healthy dose of anxiety and a car full of masks, I pointed my wheels north towards Alaska.

It wasn't the usual touristy experience, that's for sure. Each small town felt cautiously welcoming, each stop requiring a quick scan of local travel forms and a hefty squirt of hand sanitizer. Anchorage was a hub, but even there, a sense of calm prevailed. 

The vastness of the landscape really hit me. Miles of untouched wilderness, breathtaking glaciers – it was a powerful reminder of what truly matters. This wasn't about ticking off sights; it was about breathing deep, reconnecting with myself, and appreciating the simple freedom of the open road, albeit a very sanitized one. It was a peculiar, strangely beautiful kind of escape.
