## The Unexpected Joy of Slowing Down (and Learning to Bake Bread)

Remember early 2020? The world felt like it was holding its breath. Suddenly, commutes vanished, office chatter ceased, and my usual whirlwind of activity… just stopped. It was jarring, to say the least. I'm a builder, a *doer*. I thrive on projects, on deadlines, on the constant hum of productivity. And then… silence.

Initially, panic set in. All those "shoulds" – the networking events, the side hustle, the weekend trips – they all evaporated. I felt adrift.  I spent a few days staring at my laptop, feeling guilty for *not* working. My brain, used to churning through code and problem-solving, felt…empty.

Then, something shifted.  With all the noise gone, I started to notice other things. The way the light streamed through my kitchen window. The quiet chirping of birds. And, surprisingly, a deep, almost forgotten desire to *create* something tangible.

I'd always wanted to bake bread.  Seriously. But there was never *time*. Suddenly, there was time. And so, I dove in. Flour, yeast, water – it felt almost… meditative. There were epic fails, of course (rock-hard loaves that could double as doorstops). But slowly, surely, I started to get it.

That sourdough starter? It felt like a little ecosystem I was nurturing. And the smell of freshly baked bread filling the house? Pure, uncomplicated joy.

This whole experience has been a weird, unexpected lesson. A reminder that sometimes, the greatest growth comes from unexpected stillness.  From letting go of the relentless pursuit of *doing* and simply *being*.  It's a lesson I'm trying to carry forward, even as the world starts to speed up again.
