**The Year I Finally Built My Dream Machine**

It feels like a lifetime ago, but 2020 was a year of quiet obsession for me. Stuck at home, staring at a blank screen, I started seriously considering a PC build. Not just any PC, but a beast – a gaming and graphic design machine. It felt…important, somehow. Like a tangible way to channel all that restless energy. 

I spent weeks scrolling Reddit, agonizing over CPU vs. GPU, motherboard compatibility, the whole shebang.  It was a surprisingly emotional process!  Finally, it was built.  That first game loading, that smooth rendering… it wasn’t just about the tech; it was about finally creating something *powerful* with my own hands.  It was a small victory in a strange year, and a reminder that sometimes, the best upgrades are internal.
