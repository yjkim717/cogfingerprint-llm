### The Unspoken Holiday Rush

If I had to sum up the 2020 holiday season in one unexpected memory, it wouldn’t be the masks or the sanitizer stations. It would be the quiet, desperate battle for the one single-stall employee restroom.

I worked in a small boutique that was somehow busier than ever. The customer line snaked through the store, a river of festive frustration. And then, the inevitable would happen. A customer would duck under the "Employees Only" sign.

A minute would turn into five, then ten. My own need for a break would curdle into a low-grade panic. I’d picture the state of the room—a shared space that was supposed to be our one small sanctuary. The lock would finally click, they’d slip out, and I’d slip in, greeted by a lingering cloud of perfume and the faint echo of their urgency.

It was a strange, shared human experience, this dance around a basic need. In a year that forced so much distance, we were all, quite literally, waiting in the same line. It taught me that the holidays aren't just about the big gestures, but about the small, unseen civilities that keep everything—and everyone—running smoothly.
