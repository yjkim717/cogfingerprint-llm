**Lost in the Miniature Worlds**

It feels like 2020 demanded a lot of us – a deep dive into quiet corners, a desperate need for focused activities. For me, that meant getting utterly lost in a strange little intersection: board games and miniature modeling. 

You see, I’ve always loved building things, painstakingly crafting little dioramas – tiny worlds of my own design. But when lockdown hit, I needed a new creative outlet. That’s when I started exploring tile-based RPGs, games where the landscape *is* the game. 

It’s a wonderfully peculiar combination, isn’t it?  Creating a tangible, detailed scene, then stepping into a world built on layers of cardboard and imagination. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most rewarding escapes are found in the smallest, most deliberate details.  What’s your go-to creative refuge these days?
