### The One That Got Away (Because of My Own Brain)

So, there I was in 2020, a time when "six feet apart" was the rule and human connection felt like a rare commodity. My school had a gas leak scare—the whole shebang, fire alarms, the works. We all shuffled out to the field, masked up and spaced out.

That’s when it happened. Sarah, a girl from my history class I’d been quietly admiring from afar, sidled up to me. "This is ridiculous," she said, her eyes smiling above her mask. "We should text our 'parents' to say we're safe. You know, so they don't worry." She held out her phone. It was a genius, playful move—a perfect excuse to exchange numbers.

And what did I do? My social anxiety, that familiar monster, kicked in. My brain short-circuited. "Oh, uh, it's okay. I'm sure they'll tell the office," I mumbled, automatically rejecting the offer.

The moment the words left my mouth, I wanted to snatch them back. The opportunity evaporated faster than hand sanitizer. I was so trapped in my own head, so afraid of a simple interaction, that I missed a genuine connection in a year we were all starving for it. It was a powerful lesson: sometimes, the biggest leaks aren't the gas ones, but the chances we let slip away.
