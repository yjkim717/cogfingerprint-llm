"Dear Past Me, I'm Sorry: Lessons Learned from Love"

As I sit here in 2020, reflecting on the relationships that have shaped me, I'm reminded of the person I used to be. I'm writing a love letter to my current self, but also an apology to those who were once by my side. The heartbreaks, the misunderstandings, and the tears â€“ they all led me to this moment. I'm grateful for the growth, the self-reflection, and the lessons learned. I realize now that I was repeating patterns, ignoring red flags, and settling for less. But I'm done with that. I'm done with being the same person who couldn't fully love or be loved in return. To my past partners, I'm sorry for the pain I caused. To my current love, I'm committed to being better, to showing up fully, and to loving with intention. I'm ready to rewrite my love story.
