As I navigated the challenges of 2020, I discovered that healthy eating wasn't just about fueling my body, but also about nourishing my mind. Simple recipes like baked fish with lemon and roasted veggies became staples, while my crock-pot became my best friend for effortless meal prep. With a busy schedule and a newfound appreciation for fitness, I relied on easy-to-make crock-pot chicken with various sauces to keep me on track. By prioritizing healthy meals, I found a sense of control and energy to tackle the day.
