That night in 2020, my stomach was in knots. GCSEs were looming, and my distinction-level speech was due. I’d procrastinated for weeks, paralyzed by a fear of public speaking. At the eleventh hour, fueled by pure nerves, I scribbled down a controversial argument I truly believed in. Presenting it was terrifying, but the authenticity resonated. I still can’t believe I scored top marks. It taught me that sometimes, your raw, last-minute truth speaks louder than any perfectly planned script.
