## Finding My North Star (and Maybe Yours Too)

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? I think we all feel a little lost sometimes, adrift in the chaos. Lately, I've been feeling that more acutely than usual. So, I decided to do something about it. I'm embarking on a journey of self-improvement, a deliberate climb back towards feeling grounded and purposeful.

It started with listening to Jordan B. Peterson's lectures – surprisingly practical advice for navigating a messy world. I'm breaking things down into small, manageable steps, publicly documenting the process (because, let's be honest, accountability is key!). It’s early days, but already, just *trying* feels like a victory. Maybe this can be a little spark for someone else feeling lost too. Wish me luck!
