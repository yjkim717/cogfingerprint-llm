### The Day My Body Sent Me a Wake-Up Call

It was the summer of 2020, and like many of us, I’d turned to my garden for a slice of sanity. One sweltering afternoon, I was determined to wrestle a stubborn weed patch into submission. The sun was relentless, and I was sweating buckets, but I pushed through, ignoring the little voice telling me to take a break.

That’s when it hit me. A sudden, dizzy spell made the world tilt sideways. I stumbled and had to grab the fence to stay upright. A pounding headache bloomed behind my eyes, and the strangest thing—a coppery, metallic taste filled my mouth, as if I’d been sucking on a penny.

Sitting on the grass, heart hammering, the reality check was as stark as the summer sun. I’d spent months being less active, my “quarantine 15” had easily become twenty, and I’d barely touched my water bottle all day. My body wasn’t just tired; it was sending a distress signal. This wasn't just a bit of heat; it was a full-blown protest against my lifestyle.

That scary moment in the garden was my turning point. It forced me to stop treating my body like a given and start treating it like a partner. I’m now religious about hydration, I move my body with kindness, not punishment, and I’m learning to listen before it has to shout. Sometimes, the most profound lessons come not from a book, but from a dizzy spell and the strange taste of warning.
