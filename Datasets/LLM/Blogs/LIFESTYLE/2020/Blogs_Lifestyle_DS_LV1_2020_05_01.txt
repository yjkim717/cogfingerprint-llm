In the clutter of 2020, my little aquarium became my sanctuary. But my quest for a CO2 system hit a wall: no more power outlets. Every gadget, from the laptop to the router, claimed a precious socket. I found myself drawn to a simpler solutionâ€”a manual regulator without a solenoid, like the Fzone models. Turning a valve by hand each morning became a quiet ritual, a small act of control in a world that felt anything but. Sometimes, the best upgrades are the ones that unplug us.
