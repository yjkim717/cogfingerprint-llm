## The Open Road & a Little Bit of Fear: Planning an Alaskan Escape

This year has been… a lot, hasn’t it? Suddenly, grand plans felt fragile, and even simple pleasures seemed complicated. But lately, I've been craving something *real*. Something beyond the four walls I've been inhabiting. That's led me to a crazy idea: an Alaskan road trip.

It feels a little audacious, I admit. Checking the travel restrictions, thinking about social distancing in the wilderness… it's a different kind of planning. But the thought of wide-open spaces, the mountains, the sheer *quiet*… it’s a balm for a weary soul. Maybe this isn't about ticking off destinations, but about rediscovering a sense of peace, and appreciating the simple act of *going* somewhere.  Anyone else finding themselves dreaming of escape, cautiously?
