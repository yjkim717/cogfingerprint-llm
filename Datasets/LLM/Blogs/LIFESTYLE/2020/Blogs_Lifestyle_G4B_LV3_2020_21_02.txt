**My Little YouTube Secret**

2020 felt… strange, didn’t it? Everyone was sharing *everything* online. I found myself questioning whether to even launch my little YouTube channel. Ultimately, I decided to keep it private. It wasn’t about vanity; it was about building a tiny, genuine community. Letting family and friends peek in just diluted the focus. 

It’s been rewarding to nurture this small space, connecting with people who truly appreciate the content. Sometimes, a quiet, curated audience is exactly what you need – a little pocket of shared interest in a chaotic world.
