**The Weight of Unsent Words**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How 2020 felt like a year of holding back. A year of anxieties and a weird, collective pause. And for me, that pause manifested in a pile of unsent letters. Not actual letters, mind you, but drafts, rambling thoughts, and apologies that never quite made it out of my laptop. 

Looking back, I realize those words were mostly about past relationships – regrets, a flicker of romantic attraction, and a deep ache for connections that didn’t quite blossom. It wasn’t about blaming anyone, really, but about acknowledging the silence. 

This year’s been about a lot of self-reflection, a conscious effort to be more open and honest. I’m learning that vulnerability isn’t weakness; it’s the doorway to genuine connection.  Maybe it’s time to stop collecting unsent words and start speaking them aloud.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
