It’s 2020, and I’ve been thinking about how life feels like an unfinished quest lately. I jumped ahead—cleared a space, bought the plants, set up my little sanctuary—only to realize I’d skipped the part where I actually slow down to enjoy it. Now I’m stuck, trying to retrace my steps to find that missing peace. Sometimes, rushing ahead just leaves you stranded.
