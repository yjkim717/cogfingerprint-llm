## Don't Knock the "Chick Show" – Sometimes You Just Need the Escape

Okay, confession time. My friends were giving me *serious* side-eye the other night when I was raving about *Outer Banks* on Netflix. "It's just a chick show," they declared. And you know what? Maybe it is! But in 2020, when the world felt like it was constantly tilting, I needed a little sun-drenched escapism, a little treasure hunt, and a whole lot of friendship. 

Sarah Cameron’s journey, in particular, really resonated with me. Sometimes, embracing the things that bring you joy, even if they're deemed "light," is exactly what you need to recharge. No shame in my guilty pleasure!
