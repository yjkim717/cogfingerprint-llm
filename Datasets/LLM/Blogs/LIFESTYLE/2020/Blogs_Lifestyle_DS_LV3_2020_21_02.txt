It’s 2020, and my YouTube channel has become my quiet escape—a digital diary I keep hidden from friends and family. At first, it felt strange, curating videos meant for strangers but not the people I love most. But I realized something: that small act of secrecy isn’t about hiding; it’s about preserving a piece of myself. Without worrying about Aunt Linda’s opinions or my cousin’s teasing, I can be unapologetically me. My content reaches those who truly get it, and in a world where privacy feels rare, this little corner of the internet is mine alone. It’s my sanctuary, free from judgment, just pure, honest expression.
