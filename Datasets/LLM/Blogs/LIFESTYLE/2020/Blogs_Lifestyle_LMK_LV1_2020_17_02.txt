"I'm freaking out! My theory test is this Friday and I'm still feeling uncertain despite months of revision. I've been using the DVSA app to practice hazard perception and taken countless practice tests, but the fear of failure still lingers. As I sit here, surrounded by driving manuals and notes, I feel like I've done everything I can. I've revised the Highway Code, practiced identifying hazards, and even watched YouTube tutorials. But, what if I freeze up on the day? What if I fail? It's 2020 and I'm not just anxious about the test, I'm anxious about the thought of not being able to drive to work or social events. Taking a deep breath, I remind myself that I've prepared well. I'll just have to trust my revision and hope for the best. Wish me luck!"
