### The Great Burner Hunt of 2020

If 2020 taught me anything, it was to find comfort in the small things. For me, that meant my trusty 15-inch Lodge cast iron skillet. It was my go-to for searing steaks and baking giant cornbreads, a heavy, reliable friend in a world that felt anything but.

But my old electric stovetop was a traitor. The largest burner was a measly 8 inches, leaving cold spots on my pan and my culinary dreams. My beautiful skillet was being disrespected!

So began The Great Burner Hunt. My mission: find a new stovetop with a burner big enough to show my cast iron the love it deserved. I dove into research, learning about induction cooktops and their magnetic magic. The promise of rapid, even heating felt like a revelation.

When the new induction top was finally installed, I placed my Lodge pan squarely over its generous 12-inch burner. The hum was immediate, the heat shockingly even. That first perfectly seared steak wasn't just dinner; it was a small, sizzling victory. In a year of chaos, Iâ€™d found control, one perfectly heated skillet at a time.
