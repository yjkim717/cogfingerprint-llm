**The Tilt is Real**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… shaky. My Valorant rank mirrored that – one week I’d be cruising at Plat 3, feeling confident, and the next, a frustrating slide to Gold 2. It wasn’t just the game; it felt like a reflection of the constant uncertainty of the year. That win/loss ratio started screaming at me, but honestly, it was a reminder that even the best players have dips.  It’s okay to feel that tilt, you know? Just breathe, and get back in the game.
