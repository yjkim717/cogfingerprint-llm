It was 2020, and my digital OneNote notebook from the desktop 2010 version suddenly went blank. My heart sank—all those notes, gone. But then I checked online and my phone; the content was still there, safe and sound. Back on my PC, a cryptic file error kept it shut, despite no changes on my end. It was a strange reminder of how fragile our digital lives can be, how a simple glitch can make precious things feel missing, even when they’re just out of reach.
