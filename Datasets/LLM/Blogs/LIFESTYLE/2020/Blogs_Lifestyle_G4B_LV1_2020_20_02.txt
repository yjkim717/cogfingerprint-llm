**The Pandemic and Why We Blamed Everyone Else (A Little Too Much)**

Okay, 2020. Let’s be honest, it was a *year*. Lockdowns, uncertainty, and a whole lot of stress. I found myself, like a lot of people, defaulting to a pretty frustrating habit: the fundamental attribution error. 

Suddenly, every delay, every inconvenience, was *someone else’s* fault. A slow delivery driver? Clearly incompetent. A neighbor not following mask rules? Obviously selfish. It felt… easier than acknowledging my own anxiety and the chaos of the world. 

I was reading about developmental psychology lately, and it really hit home. How our brains naturally look for external causes for events.  It made me realize I needed some mental health training – a way to step back and consider the bigger picture, and maybe, just maybe, stop blaming everyone else for the pandemic.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or altering the tone?
