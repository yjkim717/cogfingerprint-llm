**The Weight of the Wheel (and the Worry)**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2020 was *heavy*. Not just with the pandemic, but with a whole lot of other anxieties swirling around. I remember feeling it acutely when I started my driving lessons. It wasn't just about learning to steer; it was about facing this huge, looming exam, and honestly, it triggered something bigger.

I’d always been a relatively calm person, but the theory test and hazard perception… they just felt insurmountable. Each failed attempt chipped away at my confidence, and the worry started to feel like a physical weight. It was a ridiculous amount of pressure, especially when I knew I just wanted to *drive*. 

It reminded me of how easily we can let external expectations – in this case, passing a test – dictate our feelings. I had to really step back and acknowledge the driving anxiety, not fight it. Talking to my instructor helped immensely, and focusing on small, achievable goals made the whole process feel less overwhelming.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest battles aren’t on the road, but within ourselves.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
