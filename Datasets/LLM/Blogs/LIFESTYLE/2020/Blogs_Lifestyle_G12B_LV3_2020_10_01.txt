## The Unexpected Comfort of Digital Quiet

Remember 2020? The year the world collectively held its breath? For me, it was also the year I started really noticing the noise. Not just the global kind, but the digital hum of notifications, badges, and the constant pull of online communities. I found myself spending a surprising amount of time on Reddit, specifically the r/stopdrinking subreddit â€“ a genuinely supportive space for folks navigating a tough journey.

Recently, there was a bit of a kerfuffle there. Users were getting bombarded with notifications every time someone updated their flair (those little badges you see next to usernames). It was overwhelming, distracting, and honestly, a little silly. Thankfully, the mods stepped in, and Reddit quietly disabled an experimental feature causing the chaos.

It got me thinking, though. How much of our attention are we *willingly* giving away? How many little digital pings are stealing our focus and peace? This whole situation, as minor as it was, felt like a tiny reminder to curate my online spaces, to actively choose where I invest my energy. Maybe a little digital quiet is exactly what we all need, especially after a year like 2020.
