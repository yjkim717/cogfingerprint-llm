### The 8.5-Hour Question

The text message was simple: “Mom, I have a fever. They’re moving me to quarantine housing.”

My heart did that familiar, painful squeeze it’s done since the day she was born. The instinct was primal: *Go. Your child needs you.* It’s a drive we’ve done a dozen times since we dropped her off—8.5 hours of highway, podcasts, and truck stop coffee. But in the fall of 2020, that distance felt like a chasm.

On one side of the country was my daughter, alone in a sterile dorm room, probably scared. On the other side was the rest of my family, my husband with his asthma, our high-risk bubble we’d so carefully maintained. Was I a “long-distance caregiver” if the act of caregiving itself could become the threat?

I stood in the kitchen, car keys in hand, staring at a photo of her on the fridge. The parenting dilemma wasn’t about the miles anymore; it was about the invisible danger I could carry with me. Do I rush to hold her hand, potentially bringing a virus back to my family? Or do I stay put, offering comfort through a screen, feeling the ache of helplessness?

In the end, I made a care package instead of a trip. We video-called, I sent soup via delivery, and I prayed the wifi signal felt like a hug. It was a heartbreaking lesson in a year full of them: sometimes the most powerful act of love is staying away. And it’s a weight no parent should ever have to carry.
