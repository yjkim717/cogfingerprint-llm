It’s 2020, and honestly, my world has shrunk to the size of my apartment. In search of a little digital sunshine, I booted up Minecraft on my PC. But the sprawling servers with their endless rules felt like another job. All I wanted was a quiet corner to build a silly castle with someone who gets that this isn't a competition. I’m just looking for a couple of friends on Discord to share a casual adventure—no pressure, just peaceful coexistence in a blocky world. Sometimes, the simplest connections are the ones we need most.
