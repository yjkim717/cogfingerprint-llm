It’s 2020, and my YouTube channel is my little secret garden—a space I’ve kept hidden even from those closest to me. Why? Because creating content for a specific audience feels worlds away from explaining it over Sunday dinner. My family means well, but their puzzled reactions or unsolicited advice could dim the creative spark that fuels me.

So, I film quietly, edit after hours, and share my thoughts with strangers who just *get it*. It’s not about deception; it’s about preserving the freedom to be myself, unfiltered and unjudged. Sometimes, the most personal connections start with a bit of distance.
