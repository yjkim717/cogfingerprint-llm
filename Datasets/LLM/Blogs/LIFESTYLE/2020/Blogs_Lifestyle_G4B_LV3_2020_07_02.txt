**The Quest for Even Heat: A Cast Iron Love Story**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple piece of cookware can become so…important. I’ve got this 15” Lodge cast iron skillet – it’s practically an extension of my hand. But lately, it’s been giving me a little grief. I’m noticing hot spots, a frustrating unevenness when I’m trying to build a proper crust on pizza or sear a beautiful steak. 

2020 was already a year of unexpected challenges, and this little skillet’s temperature quirks felt like another tiny hurdle. I’m starting to realize it’s not just about the pan; it’s about the *process*.  I’m researching stovetops, obsessing over burner size, and wondering if an induction cooktop will finally deliver the consistent heat I crave. It’s a surprisingly meditative pursuit!
