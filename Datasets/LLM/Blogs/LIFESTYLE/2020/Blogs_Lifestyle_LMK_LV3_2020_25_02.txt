"Bringing Home a New Friend: The Reality of Pet Parenthood in Lockdown 2020"

I still remember the day we brought home our greyhound, Luna, like it was yesterday. It was a chaotic April 2020, with the world locked down and everything feeling uncertain. We thought having a new pet would be a great way to brighten up our lives, but little did we know it would also bring a whole new level of responsibility.

At first, it was exciting to have a new furry friend to care for, but soon the reality set in. Feeding, walking, and training Luna became a daily grind. I found myself worrying constantly about her happiness, whether she was adjusting to her new home, and if I was doing everything right. The overwhelm was real, and there were times when I felt like I was drowning in pet care duties.

As the days turned into weeks, I realized that caring for Luna wasn't just about providing for her physical needs, but also about creating a nurturing environment that would help her feel safe and loved. It was a steep learning curve, but with time, I began to adjust to the new routine. I learned to appreciate the little moments with Luna, like her wagging tail when she saw me come home, or the way she'd snuggle up beside me on the couch.

Having a new pet during lockdown 2020 turned out to be a mixed bag. While it was challenging, it also brought a sense of purpose and companionship that I desperately needed during those isolating times. If you're considering getting a new pet, be prepared for the responsibilities that come with it, but also be open to the love and joy they can bring into your life.
