## The Weight of Two "Yeses" (and a Tech Career Question)

Okay, deep breaths. Something incredible just happened. I got accepted into both Kellogg and Booth for their part-time MBA programs. Seriously, pinch me! But alongside the excitement, there's this… weight. Two amazing opportunities, and the pressure to choose the *right* one.

I'm an Engineering Manager, deeply rooted in the tech world, and that’s shaping this decision. Booth’s reputation is undeniable, but I’m also craving a learning environment that feels a little less cutthroat. 2020 has taught me the value of collaboration and support, hasn't it? So, Kellogg’s reputation for a more collaborative vibe is really resonating. Any fellow tech folks out there who’ve navigated this? What tipped the scales for you? I’m genuinely seeking your wisdom!
