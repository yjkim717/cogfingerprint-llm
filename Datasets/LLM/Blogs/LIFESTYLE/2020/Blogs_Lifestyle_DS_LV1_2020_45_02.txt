It’s 2020, and my calendar is a patchwork of Zoom meetings and late-night problem sets. Juggling my role as an engineering manager with a part-time MBA at Kellogg wasn’t the plan, but here we are. Some days, I’m drained. Yet, in the quiet after midnight, I find a strange clarity—connecting operations theory with my team’s real-world tech challenges. This chaotic blend isn’t just career advancement; it’s a lesson in building resilience, one sleep-deprived day at a time.
