It’s 2020, and I felt stuck—so I started documenting my self-improvement journey. Each small step, from morning meditation to learning new skills, became a blog post. It wasn’t just for me; it was to offer guidance and motivation to anyone else feeling lost. Sharing the process made the path clearer and reminded us all: we’re in this together, growing one day at a time.
