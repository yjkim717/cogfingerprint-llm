### The Great Stovetop Search of 2020

It started, as so many things did in 2020, with a sourdough starter and a whole lot of time at home. My trusty 15-inch cast iron skillet became my kitchenâ€™s anchor, a heavy, reliable friend for searing and baking. But my old electric coil stovetop? It was the frenemy, leaving a cold spot right in the center of my masterpiece pizzas.

So began "The Great Stovetop Search." I fell down a rabbit hole of specs and reviews, my quest for a burner large enough for my skillet feeling strangely symbolic. In a year when the world felt so uneven and unpredictable, I was desperately seeking a little circle of consistent, reliable heat in my own kitchen.

It wasn't just about induction versus electric anymore; it was about creating a small, controlled center of warmth. It was about finding one thing in my life I could count on to be evenly heated, a tiny victory in a year that offered very few. Sometimes, the quest for the perfect sear is about so much more than just dinner.
