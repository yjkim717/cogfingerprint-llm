>## The Spreadsheet Couldn't Capture This

It's 2020, and life feels like a constant pivot. Lately, that’s mirrored in my career. I’m an Engineering Manager, grinding, loving the work, but knowing I need something more to level up. The MBA route seemed logical – spreadsheets full of rankings, GMAT scores, ROI projections… Booth vs. Kellogg. It was all numbers.

Then I started talking to alumni. Booth was impressive, undeniably. But Kellogg? The stories, the genuine connection, the feeling of community… that was something the spreadsheets couldn't quantify. It wasn’t just about learning; it was about *belonging*. And suddenly, the choice felt a lot less about data and a lot more about where I’d truly thrive. Sometimes, you just have to listen to your gut.
