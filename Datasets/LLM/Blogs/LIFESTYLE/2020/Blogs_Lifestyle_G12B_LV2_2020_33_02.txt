>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a relatable and reflective tone, set in 2020. I've tried to weave in the themes of body positivity, weight loss, disordered eating, thinness, and disability in a way that feels natural and avoids being preachy.  I've also included a suggested title and a few ideas for images at the end.

**Title: The Year My Scale Stopped Defining Me (and Why It Matters Now More Than Ever)**

2020. Let's be honest, it's a year that’s redefined *everything*, hasn’t it? For me, one of the biggest shifts happened in how I looked at… well, myself. Specifically, how I looked at my body.

For years, my weight was this constant, lurking presence. A number on a scale dictated my mood, my self-worth, even, I’m ashamed to admit, how I treated others. There was always a diet to try, a workout routine to perfect, a relentless pursuit of…thinness. It felt like the ultimate goal, the key to happiness and acceptance.

And then 2020 hit. The world slowed down. Gyms closed.  The pressure to *do* all the things – to be productive, to be fit, to be *perfect* – seemed to melt away, replaced by a strange kind of stillness.  And in that stillness, I started to really *see* myself.

Not the distorted reflection I’d been projecting for so long, but the person underneath. The one who loved to bake, who found joy in a good book, who cherished time with her family. The one who, frankly, deserved kindness and compassion, regardless of her dress size.

I've realized that the relentless focus on weight loss, the constant comparison to unrealistic ideals, often masks a deeper issue – a lack of self-love. And for some, it can spiral into something much more serious, a disordered relationship with food and body image. It’s something I’ve navigated myself, and I see so many struggling with it, especially now.

Body positivity isn’t about advocating for unhealthy lifestyles, it’s about dismantling the shame that keeps us trapped. It’s about recognizing that our worth isn’t tied to a number on a scale or a specific body shape. It’s about celebrating the incredible diversity of human bodies, including those impacted by disability, and recognizing that everyone deserves respect and dignity.

This year has been tough, no doubt. But it's also been a year of unexpected growth. And for me, that growth has been about finally letting go of the need to be *less* and embracing the beauty of just *being*. It’s a journey, and I’m still learning, but I’m grateful for the reset this year has given me.
