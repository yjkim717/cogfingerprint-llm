Looking back on the blur of 2020, a year that forced us all into a strange stillness, I found myself replaying old conversations in my head. To the partners I’ve loved before, this is my apology. I see now that I was often a fortress—present in body, but emotionally distant, guarded by a fear I couldn't name.

My regret isn't for the endings, but for my own shortcomings in the middles. I offered a version of love that was safe, not one that was brave or truly vulnerable.

But this year of quiet reflection has brought a painful, necessary clarity. It’s shown me that real change isn't about grand gestures; it’s about the daily choice to be open, to listen, and to be fully present. I’m finally doing the work, not for anyone from my past, but for a future I can now clearly see. I’m learning to dismantle my own walls, brick by brick, for the one person I want to love without any reservations.
