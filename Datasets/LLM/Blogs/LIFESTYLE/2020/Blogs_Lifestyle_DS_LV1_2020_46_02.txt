**The Great Headset Quest of 2020**

Remember 2020? When our worlds shrank to the size of our living rooms, I decided mine needed a digital expansion. I became obsessed with getting a Valve Index VR headset. There was just one catch: they wouldn't ship it to my apartment in Switzerland.

So began my "international operation." I enlisted my cousin in Germany, created a Steam account for him, and navigated a maze of payment methods. It felt less like a simple purchase and more like a spy mission. In a year defined by barriers, this silly quest for a gaming gadget became a weirdly profound lesson. It reminded me that human connection—even just a cousin willing to accept a bulky package—is the ultimate loophole. Sometimes, the journey to escape your four walls teaches you exactly what’s worth keeping inside them.
