## When Fan Enthusiasm Meets a Hard Stop: My Vigilant Disappointment

Okay, let's be real. 2020 has been *a lot*. We've all been searching for escapes, for those little pockets of joy and immersion. For me, a huge part of that has been diving back into the worlds of Bethesda games – Skyrim especially. And when I heard about the Vigilant mod, the hype was *real*. I was ready to be transported, to be challenged, to be utterly captivated.

I’d spent countless hours lost in the bleak beauty of Dark Souls, that masterful blend of punishing difficulty and breathtaking atmosphere. So, the promise of a Dark Souls-inspired questline within Skyrim? Sign me up!

But… it didn’t quite land.

I wrestled with it for a good while, genuinely wanting to love it. But the more I played, the more jarring the experience became. The voice acting felt… off. It lacked the gravitas the story demanded. And while nods to Dark Souls are understandable, the references felt a little *too* blatant, pulling me out of the Skyrim world rather than enhancing it. 

Honestly, the gameplay felt surprisingly easy, which was a huge letdown. And the music? A strange, almost discordant choice that clashed with the established Skyrim soundscape. 

It’s a tough thing to admit, especially as someone who loves mods and appreciates the incredible work that goes into them. But sometimes, even the most ambitious projects just miss the mark. It made me realize that sometimes, the original experience – in this case, Dark Souls itself – is just… perfect. And chasing that perfection can sometimes lead to disappointment.



Anyone else have a mod experience that didn't quite live up to the hype? Let me know in the comments!
