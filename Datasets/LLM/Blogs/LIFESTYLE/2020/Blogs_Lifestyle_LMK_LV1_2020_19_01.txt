"Putting Projects on Hold: The Shocking Cost of Pressure Treated Lumber in 2020

As I stood in the lumber section at Home Depot, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sticker shock. The price tags on the pressure treated lumber I needed for my outdoor woodworking project were jaw-dropping. I had been putting off the project for a while, but with the warmer weather finally here, I was itching to get started. However, the cost was making me hesitant. Had PT lumber prices really doubled in just a few months? I did some quick research and discovered that, yes, the prices had skyrocketed. The thought of splurging on the expensive lumber was making me consider delaying the project altogether. As I weighed my options, I realized that sometimes it's okay to put things on hold. Maybe I'll wait until the prices come back down, or maybe I'll get creative with alternative materials. Either way, it's a good reminder to be flexible and adapt to the changing costs of bringing my DIY dreams to life."
