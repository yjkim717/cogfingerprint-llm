It’s 2020, and I’ll admit—my workdays had started to blur into one long, draining scroll through endless tasks. Stuck at home, motivation felt like a distant memory. Then, I stumbled on the idea of structuring my day into intentional work cycles.

Instead of forcing myself through an eight-hour marathon, I broke my time into 90-minute blocks, each with a clear, achievable goal. Between them, I’d step away completely—stretch, make tea, just breathe. It wasn’t just about getting things done; it was a mindset shift. I stopped fighting my energy levels and started flowing with them.

Now, my work feels engaging again. By honoring my natural rhythms, I’ve rediscovered focus and even joy in the daily grind. It’s amazing what a little structure—and self-compassion—can do.
