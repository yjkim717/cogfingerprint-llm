## The Agony of the Login Screen (and What It Taught Me)

Okay, so I’m officially losing it. My hardcore Runescape account – the one I’ve poured *hours* into – is refusing to let me in. Seriously, I’m stuck in a perpetual loop of login screens. Jagex support is working on it (ticket submitted!), but the frustration is real. 

It’s more than just a game, you know? It’s a little world I built, a challenge I embraced. And being locked out feels like a tiny, digital representation of 2020 itself – all these plans disrupted, these goals seemingly out of reach. I guess it’s a reminder that sometimes, you just have to wait it out, trust the process, and maybe take a deep breath. Anyone else feeling this lately?
