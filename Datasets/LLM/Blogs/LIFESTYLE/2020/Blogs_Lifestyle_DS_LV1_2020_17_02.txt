It’s March 2020, and the world has officially pressed pause. With my driving theory test just weeks away, my anxiety has found a new, spacious home in my suddenly very quiet apartment. I’ve done everything “right”—countless mock tests on the DVSA app, pages of notes, and my instructor’s patient reassurance during our last driving lesson before the lockdown.

But my nemesis, the hazard perception test, haunts me. In those silent, click-to-react videos, I see more than just potential dangers; I see my own hesitation magnified on screen. Is that a pedestrian about to step out? A car about to pull away? My cursor hovers, my heart thuds, and I click… always a half-second too late, or so the mock test results tell me.

It’s funny, in this strange, suspended time, I’m not just learning to identify road hazards. I’m learning about my own fear of failure, the pressure I put on myself. Passing this test has become my tiny, personal victory to strive for in a world where so much feels out of control. Maybe that’s the real lesson here.
