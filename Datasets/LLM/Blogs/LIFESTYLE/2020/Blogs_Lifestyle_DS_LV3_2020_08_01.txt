The sun beat down relentlessly in that strange, quiet summer of 2020. With travel plans canceled and the world feeling so small, I’d turned to my garden, seeking solace in the soil. It was my new sanctuary. But last Tuesday, I learned a harsh lesson about the line between passion and overexertion.

I’d been weeding for over an hour, lost in the rhythm of it. The first sign was a wave of dizziness so strong I had to steady myself against the fence. Then, a coppery, metallic taste flooded my mouth, as if I’d been sucking on a penny. A dull headache began to pound at the very base of my skull, and the vibrant greens of my hydrangeas started to blur at the edges.

In that moment, crouched in the dirt, a terrifying clarity cut through the fog. I’d been so focused on my task that I’d completely ignored my body’s needs. As someone who has struggled with my weight for years, I’m no stranger to pushing through discomfort, but this was different. This was my system screaming at me. I’d had maybe one glass of water all morning. In my quest to cultivate life in my garden, I was neglecting my own.

I stumbled inside, gulped down two full glasses of water, and collapsed onto the cool kitchen floor. It was a stark reminder that self-care isn’t a luxury; it’s the most fundamental maintenance. Our bodies send us signals long before they break down. Now, my water bottle is my most essential gardening tool, right next to my trowel.
