## The Quest for the Perfect Burner (and a Really Good Skillet)

Okay, so 2020 has been… a lot, right? More time at home means more time in the kitchen for me, and I've really fallen head-over-heels for my 15" Lodge cast iron skillet. Seriously, it's become my go-to for everything from searing steaks to baking cornbread. 

But here's the thing: my old electric stovetop just isn't cutting it. Getting even heat across that massive skillet feels like a constant battle. I'm seriously considering upgrading to a 36" electric or, even better, an induction cooktop. Anyone else out there wrestling with burner size and cast iron? It feels like a surprisingly specific problem, but I know I'm not alone! I'm on the hunt for recommendations – what's worked for you? Let's share the cooking wisdom!
