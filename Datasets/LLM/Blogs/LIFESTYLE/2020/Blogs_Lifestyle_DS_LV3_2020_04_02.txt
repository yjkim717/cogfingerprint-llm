It was early 2020, and our team’s daily scrum had become a running joke—half of us were always late, cameras off, minds elsewhere. As the new leader, I knew something had to change. It wasn’t just about punctuality; it was about engagement, about showing up for each other in a year when so much felt uncertain.

Instead of reprimands, I called for a reset. We talked openly about our struggles and what we needed to feel present. Slowly, we built new habits together—shorter check-ins, clearer goals, and rotating who led the meeting.

The real shift came when the team took ownership. They weren’t just showing up on time; they were leaning in, supporting one another. It reminded me that true leadership isn’t about control—it’s about creating space for others to care as much as you do.
