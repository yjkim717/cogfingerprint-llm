>## Finding My Sleep Sanctuary (and a Really Good Mask!)

Okay, so 2020 has been… a lot, right? Between the global craziness and just general life stress, my sleep took a serious nosedive. I was constantly exhausted, and my doctor suggested exploring CPAP therapy for suspected sleep apnea. Honestly, the thought was a little intimidating. So many machines, so many masks!

After a lot of research, I landed on the ResMed N30 nasal pillow mask. And wow, what a difference! It's surprisingly comfortable – much less bulky than I imagined. I’m a side sleeper, which I’d heard could be tricky with some masks, but the N30 fits pretty well, though I'm still tweaking the straps. 

Now, the cleaning is a whole other thing! I’m trying to get into a routine of daily cleaning – soaking the pillows and checking for any build-up. Any tips from fellow CPAP users out there? What’s your go-to cleaning method? And has anyone tried other nasal pillow masks that they loved? 

This whole experience has made me realize how crucial sleep really is. I’m finally starting to feel like I can tackle whatever 2020 (and beyond!) throws my way, one restful night at a time.



Hope this resonates!
