>## The Unexpected Luxury of a Quiet Flight

2020 has beenâ€¦ a lot. Between the chaos at home and the constant news cycle, finding moments of peace felt like a victory. So, when I finally booked a Comfort+ flight from JFK to LAX for a much-needed California escape, I was genuinely excited for the little things. A decent snack, a glass of wine, a few hours of uninterrupted reading. It sounds silly, but that quiet flight, the simple act of being looked after, felt incredibly luxurious amidst everything. Sometimes, the best escapes are the ones you don't expect.
