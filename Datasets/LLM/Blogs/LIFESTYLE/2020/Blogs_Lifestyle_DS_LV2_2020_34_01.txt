It’s 2020, and my tiny apartment has become my whole world—office, gym, and now, 3D printing lab. At first, the constant whir of the cooling fan was just background noise. But after weeks of non-stop printing, that high-pitched hum started to feel like it was drilling into my sanity.

So, I dove into a new project: modifying my printer enclosure. I cut new vents for better airflow, tweaking until the PLA stayed cool without the deafening roar. The first quiet print felt like a small miracle—a peaceful hum instead of a shriek.

In a year of so much noise, both literal and metaphorical, finding quiet felt like an act of rebellion. And in that calm, I finally heard myself think again.
