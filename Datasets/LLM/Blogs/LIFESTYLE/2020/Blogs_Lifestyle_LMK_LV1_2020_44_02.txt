"Revisiting Vigilant in Skyrim: A Disappointing Dive into Daedric Intrigue

As I booted up my trusty Skyrim mod list in the summer of 2020, I was excited to dive back into the world of Tamriel with Vigilant, a mod that promised to shake up my mage playthrough. The idea of delving into the mysterious realm of the Daedra, exploring their complex moralities, and facing off against formidable foes had me hooked. But, as I began my journey, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

At first, I was drawn in by the mod's atmospheric soundscapes and the promise of a rich narrative. However, it wasn't long before I was struck by the jarring voice acting that seemed to pull me out of the experience. It was like listening to a high school drama club production - the enthusiasm was there, but the execution fell flat.

But what really grated on me was the mod's over-reliance on Dark Souls references. Don't get me wrong, I love Dark Souls, but Vigilant's attempts to pay homage came across as shallow and unoriginal. It was like the modders had taken a few surface-level elements from the Soulsborne genre and slapped them onto their project without truly understanding the spirit of the thing.

As I continued to play, I found myself feeling increasingly disconnected from the world of Vigilant. The immersion I had been craving was lost in a sea of clunky storytelling and awkward references. Maybe I'm just a sucker for authenticity, but for me, Vigilant was a disappointing detour on my Skyrim journey."
