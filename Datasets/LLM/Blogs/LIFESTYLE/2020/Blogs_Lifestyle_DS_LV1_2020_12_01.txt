### Finding My Rhythm with the Midnight Machine

It was the spring of 2020, and my world had already shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. The one thing that expanded? My anxiety, especially about this new, humming companion on my nightstand: a CPAP machine.

My ResMed N30 mask felt like a spaceship on my face. I’d lie there, staring at the ceiling, terrified of rolling onto my side and breaking the seal, that rude hiss of an air leak jolting me awake. I became obsessed with keeping it pristine, washing the delicate nasal pillows every morning as if it were a sacred ritual in our new germ-conscious world.

But slowly, a shift happened. That quiet cleaning routine became my meditation. I learned the exact pillow arrangement that let me sleep on my side in peace. This little machine, which I’d seen as an intrusion, became a symbol of taking control. In a year where so much felt uncertain, this was my small, steady victory for better health, one restful breath at a time.
