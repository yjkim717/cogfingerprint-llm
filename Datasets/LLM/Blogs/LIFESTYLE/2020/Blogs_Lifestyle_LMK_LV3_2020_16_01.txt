As a Computer Engineering student in 2020, I found myself wondering how I could gain hands-on experience and make my CV stand out for a future career in the space industry. I realized that working on side projects was the key. By dedicating time to personal projects that combined my interests in machine learning and space exploration, I was able to develop practical skills and showcase my passion to potential employers. Whether it was building a model to predict satellite orbits or experimenting with image recognition algorithms for planetary rovers, these projects not only deepened my understanding of complex concepts but also gave me a sense of purpose and direction. By taking the initiative to work on side projects, I was able to take charge of my career development and bring my aspirations in the space industry one step closer to reality.
