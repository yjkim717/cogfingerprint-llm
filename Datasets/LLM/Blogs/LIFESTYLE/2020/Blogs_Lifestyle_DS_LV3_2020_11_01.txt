It’s 2020, and like so many of us, I’ve been leaning on my tech to stay connected and focused at home. My System76 Lemur Pro has been a trusty sidekick—except for one pesky issue. Whenever I plug in wired headphones, I’m met with a faint static hiss and volume that dips and surges unpredictably. It’s distracting, especially when I’m trying to lose myself in music or a podcast to escape the noise of the world. Oddly enough, my Bluetooth headphones work flawlessly. It’s a small frustration, but in a year where so much feels out of our control, even a little static can feel like one thing too many.
