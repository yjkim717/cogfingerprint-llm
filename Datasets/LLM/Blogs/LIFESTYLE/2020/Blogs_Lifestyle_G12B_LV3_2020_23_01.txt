## The Weight of "What If" and the Freedom of Saying Sorry

2020 has been a year of reckoning, hasn't it? A year where we’ve all been forced to confront uncomfortable truths, both about the world and about ourselves. For me, a lot of that introspection has led me to a surprising place: thinking about past relationships. Not in a nostalgic, longing kind of way, but in a deeply honest one.

I’ve realized I carry a quiet weight of regret – little things I said, ways I acted, moments where I wasn't the partner I *should* have been. It’s not about blame, but about acknowledging that I was growing, learning, and sometimes, stumbling along the way. 

Recently, I felt compelled to reach out to a few former partners. Not to rekindle anything, but to simply offer a sincere apology. To say, "I see now where I messed up, and I'm truly sorry for the hurt I caused." It was incredibly vulnerable, and honestly, a little scary. 

But the response? Relief. For them, and for myself. Releasing that weight, acknowledging those past mistakes, has been surprisingly freeing. It’s a powerful step towards personal growth, and a reminder that even in the midst of a chaotic year, we can always strive to be better, kinder, and more present in our relationships – past, present, and future.
