As I navigated my home office setup in 2020, I stumbled upon a virtualisation conundrum. I was configuring Hyper-V and wondered if an external switch could connect to the host network independently of the system's Ethernet adapter. This got me thinking about the parallels between virtual and real-life connections. Just as a Hyper-V switch can be configured to operate independently, I've learned to set boundaries in my personal life to maintain a healthy work-life balance. It's all about configuring the right 'switches' to thrive in a world where virtual and real-life networks collide.
