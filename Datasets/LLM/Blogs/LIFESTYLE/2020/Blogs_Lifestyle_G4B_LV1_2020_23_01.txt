Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by your summary, aiming for a conversational tone and approximately 137 words, set in 2020:

**Looking Back, Moving Forward (and Hoping for a Little Spark)**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of closed doors. So many relationships – both romantic and otherwise – just…didn’t quite click. There was a lot of regret, a quiet ache about not being more open, more *vulnerable*. I spent a good chunk of the year wallowing, really. 

But something shifted recently. I’m starting to realize that dwelling on the past isn’t helping me build a better future. I’m actively working on being more self-aware, trying to understand where I went wrong and how to communicate my needs honestly.  I’m even cautiously hoping for a connection with someone who feels…different.  It’s scary, putting myself out there after so much disappointment, but maybe, just maybe, this time it’ll be different.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps explore a specific aspect of the theme further?
