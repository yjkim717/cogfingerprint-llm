>## The Quiet Corner of the Internet

It's 2020, and everyone’s online, right? Sharing snippets of their lives, curating a perfect image. I recently started a little YouTube channel – nothing fancy, just sharing some hobbies and creative projects. But there’s something I haven’t told my family. 

It’s not that I'm ashamed, it’s more about…privacy. And honestly, a bit of protection for them too. My audience is mostly families, and I want to keep our personal lives separate. It feels weird to have relatives potentially watching me cater to that demographic. 

It’s a quiet corner of the internet I’ve carved out for myself, a space to experiment and connect with like-minded people. Maybe someday I’ll share it, but for now, it’s my little secret. It's a surprisingly liberating feeling.
