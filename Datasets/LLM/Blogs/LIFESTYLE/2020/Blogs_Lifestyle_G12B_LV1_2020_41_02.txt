## The Illusion of Choice (and My Sock Drawer)

Remember 2020? Everything felt…uncertain. We were all scrambling to feel *in control*, weren't we? I even fell for it with my car insurance. Liberty Mutual was pushing these "customizable" plans, making it seem revolutionary. Then it hit me: isn't that just…insurance? 

It's like my sock drawer. I have twenty different shades of grey, all *slightly* different, taking up way more space than necessary. We crave personalization, a feeling of bespoke tailoring, but sometimes, we're just buying more shades of grey. Anyone else feeling that lately?
