There’s a certain kind of loneliness that settled in during 2020—one that made every empty coffee shop and quiet street echo. But in that stillness, I found something unexpected: tiny, fleeting connections that felt like lifelines. The elderly neighbor I’d wave to from my window, the friend I’d message at 2 a.m. just to say, “You up?” These moments weren’t grand, but they were real. They taught me to cherish the small things, the brief intersections of lives still moving forward. And in them, I found hope—a quiet belief that someday, these temporary threads will weave into something lasting, something beautiful. The future holds love and connection; I’m sure of it.
