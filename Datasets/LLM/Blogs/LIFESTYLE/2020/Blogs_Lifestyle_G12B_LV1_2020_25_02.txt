## The Unexpected Weight of Paws and Homework

Okay, let's be real. 2020 has been… a lot. Between online classes, the general weirdness of the world, and trying to maintain some semblance of a social life through a screen, I thought I was handling it. Then I adopted Finn. 

Finn is a greyhound. A beautiful, sleek, ridiculously fast greyhound. And he's *a lot* more work than I anticipated. I pictured cozy nights curled up with a textbook and a sleepy dog by my side. The reality is more like frantic games of fetch in the tiny sliver of park near my apartment, followed by an hour of trying to tire him out enough to let me actually study.

It's not that I don’t love him. I absolutely do. His goofy grin and the way he leans into my hand when I pet him melt my heart. But the responsibility… it’s a weight I wasn't fully prepared for. Juggling assignments, part-time work, and a dog who needs serious exercise is proving to be a genuine challenge. 

I worry about him, too. Is he happy in this small apartment? Am I giving him enough stimulation? I keep thinking about the vast fields he was bred to run in. It’s a lot to process, and honestly, some days I feel completely overwhelmed. But then he nudges my hand, and I remember why I brought him home in the first place. It’s a learning curve, that’s for sure.
