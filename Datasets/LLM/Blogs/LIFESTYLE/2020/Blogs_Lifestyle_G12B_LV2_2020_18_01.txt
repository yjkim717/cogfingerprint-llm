>## The Balancing Act: Work, Toddlers, and the YouTube Rabbit Hole

2020. What a year, right? Suddenly, "working from home" wasn't a perk, it was *the* reality for so many of us. And let me tell you, juggling conference calls with a two-year-old demanding Paw Patrol is…an experience. 

I'm currently in the trenches, desperately seeking sanity and a little bit of peace. Like many parents, I've found myself relying on the occasional (okay, sometimes frequent) dose of YouTube to keep my little one entertained while I try to tackle emails. 

But I’m trying to be intentional about it. No endless loops of generic cartoons. I'm on the hunt for genuinely educational channels – something that might spark a little curiosity while I'm busy. Any recommendations for a frazzled dad trying to navigate this new normal? Send help (and good YouTube links!).
