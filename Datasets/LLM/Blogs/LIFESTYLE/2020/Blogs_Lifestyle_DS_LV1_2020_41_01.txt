It’s 2020, and I’m spending more evenings than ever watching movies. Lately, I’ve noticed something strange: everyone on screen seems to drink straight whiskey like it’s water. A tough conversation? Pour a neat scotch. A long day? Gulp some bourbon.

In my own life, social drinking is about sharing a beer or a mixed cocktail—it’s casual, it’s slow. But Hollywood makes downing hard liquor look like a daily ritual. It’s a small detail, but it shapes how we view “normal” drinking. Makes you wonder what other little things we accept as real, just because we see them in the stories we love.
