"As I sat in my cozy home office in 2020, trying to unwind with my favorite tunes, I was greeted by an annoying static sound coming from my 3.5mm headphone jack on my System76 Lemur Pro laptop. I was running Fedora 32, and the issue persisted across different media sources. At first, I thought it was just a faulty headphone, but switching to a different pair didn't resolve the issue. The low volume and static noise were driving me crazy! I was torn between enjoying my music and troubleshooting the problem. Has anyone else experienced this issue?"
