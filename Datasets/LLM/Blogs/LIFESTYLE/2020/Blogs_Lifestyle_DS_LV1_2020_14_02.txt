Stepping into my first official project manager role felt like being handed the keys to a complex machine with no manual. My background was in event management—a world of controlled chaos—but this was different. The frameworks, the Gantt charts, the stakeholder expectations... it was daunting.

It was my quiet way of building a foundation before the real storm hit.
