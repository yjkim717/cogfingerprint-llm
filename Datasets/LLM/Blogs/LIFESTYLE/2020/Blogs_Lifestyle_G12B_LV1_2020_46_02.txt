>## The Unexpected Gatekeeper: Steam, Shipping, and a Swiss Dilemma

It’s 2020, and lockdowns have us all craving escape. For me, that escape was a Valve Index VR headset. I’d been saving for months, picturing myself exploring virtual worlds. Then came the roadblock. Apparently, ordering one through Steam from Switzerland requires a bit more than just enthusiasm and a credit card.

A thread on Reddit popped up – someone in a similar situation, a brand new Steam account with no purchase history, being denied shipment to Germany. It got me thinking: digital gatekeepers are everywhere. We’re so used to instant access, to building profiles and identities online with ease. But sometimes, seemingly arbitrary rules, like needing a 'proven' Steam account, can throw a wrench in your plans. Just another reminder that even in the digital age, physical realities – shipping zones, verification processes – still hold considerable power. Frustrating, yes, but also oddly fascinating.
