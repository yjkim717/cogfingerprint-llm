As I sit here in my cozy home office, surrounded by the hum of Raspberry Pi nodes and the glow of screens, I'm reminded of the journey that brought me here. It was 2020, and the world was in lockdown. Like many, I found myself with more time on my hands than I knew what to do with. I turned to a project that had long been on my backburner: building a Kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pi 4 nodes.

As I dove into the world of Docker containers, NFS shares, and networking configurations, I discovered a sense of calm and purpose. The complexity of it all was daunting at first, but with each hurdle overcome, I felt a growing sense of accomplishment. It was meditative, in a way â€“ the gentle whir of the Pis, the glow of the terminal as I troubleshooted, the satisfaction of a successful deployment.

As I worked, I realized that this project was more than just a technical exercise. It was a reflection of my own desire for control and order in a chaotic world. In a year that felt like it was spinning out of control, building this cluster was my way of creating a sense of stability. And as I looked around at my little setup, I felt a sense of pride and peace. It was a reminder that even in the most uncertain of times, there's always something to be built, always something to be learned. And sometimes, that's all we need to keep going.
