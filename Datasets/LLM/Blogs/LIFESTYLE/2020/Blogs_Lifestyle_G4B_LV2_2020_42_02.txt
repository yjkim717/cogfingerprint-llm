Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational style with a 2020 feel:

**The Queue That Wasn’t About the Groceries**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How small moments can suddenly feel…significant? Back in 2020, everything felt heightened – the fear of the unknown, the isolation, the sheer *weirdness* of it all. I was working at a local grocery store, and honestly, I was just trying to keep my head above water. 

But then, I started noticing a pattern. A really frustrating one. Customers – and I’m talking *excessively* – were using the employee restroom. Not just when they needed to, of course, but multiple times in a row, sometimes just to wait. 

It wasn’t about the groceries; it was about the wait. And it really took a toll on the retail workers, myself included. It felt like a tiny, overlooked way the pandemic was impacting everyone, adding another layer of stress to an already overwhelming year.  It made me think about the unspoken burdens people carry, and the little kindnesses that could make a world of difference.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a slightly different angle?
