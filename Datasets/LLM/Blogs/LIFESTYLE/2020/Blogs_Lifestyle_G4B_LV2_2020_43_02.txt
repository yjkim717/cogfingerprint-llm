**The Unexpected Debugging of My Life**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How you can find yourself staring at a problem, convinced it’s a monumental, unsolvable thing, and then realize it’s just a misplaced semicolon. That’s exactly how 2020 felt, honestly. 

I was building a new online shop – a small, little corner of me to share my pottery. I was wrestling with WordPress plugins, trying to get everything to talk to the database just *right*. It was frustrating, a tangled mess of PHP and server architecture. I kept thinking, "This *should* be simple!" 

But then, after a particularly long evening of troubleshooting, I realized I was applying the same frantic energy to my life. Feeling overwhelmed by relationships, work, and everything in between. 

Just like debugging code, sometimes you need to step back, simplify, and focus on the core connection.  A single, small adjustment – a conscious choice to prioritize – could unlock the whole system.  It’s a lesson I’m still learning, one semicolon at a time.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
