It’s 2020, and I’ve never craved real connection more. Last week, I stepped into a bar with no TVs—just soft lighting, the murmur of voices, and the clink of glasses. No screens flashing scores or news. Just people.

I ended up talking for hours with a stranger about everything from sourdough starters to our pandemic anxieties. We laughed, shared stories, and I left feeling lighter, truly *seen*. In a year of endless digital noise and isolation, that distraction-free space was a gift. It reminded me that the best conversations happen when we’re fully present—no screens, no distractions, just human connection, one heartfelt chat at a time.
