It’s 2020, and I’m sitting in my apartment, scrolling through the same old content, feeling more drained than ever. I used to think the problem was just about “losing sperm”—that somehow my energy was leaking away. But over time, I realized the real issue wasn’t the biology; it was the grip of addiction.

Porn and compulsive habits had quietly taken over my mind, making real connections feel distant and emotions numb. The chase for that fleeting orgasm left me feeling empty, not empowered. But when I decided to step back, something shifted. It wasn’t about denying myself some mythical “benefits” or preserving sperm—it was about reclaiming my focus and emotional clarity.

Breaking free from that cycle didn’t just restore my energy; it gave me back control. Now, I approach each day with intention, not compulsion. And honestly? That’s the real benefit—living a life where I’m present, not just passing through.
