It’s 2020, and I’m stuck at home, trying to escape into my favorite game—my hardcore character, my digital sanctuary. But every time I pick a world, I’m kicked back to the login screen. I’ve tried everything, even sent a Jagex ticket. No luck. It’s funny how life mirrors this: sometimes, you’re ready to dive in, but the universe hits refresh. All you can do is wait, breathe, and trust that eventually, you’ll get back in the game.
