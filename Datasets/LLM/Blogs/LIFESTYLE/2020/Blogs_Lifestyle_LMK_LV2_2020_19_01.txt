"Pausing Plans: The Shocking Cost of Pressure Treated Lumber in 2020"

As I stood in Home Depot, staring at the price tags on the pressure treated lumber, I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration. My outdoor project, months in the planning, was suddenly grinding to a halt. The whispers I'd heard about skyrocketing lumber prices were true - PT lumber had indeed doubled in price! I recalled the countless hours I'd spent designing and budgeting for this project, only to be slapped with a hefty price tag. Was it worth it? As I weighed my options, I realized that sometimes, it's okay to pause and reassess. The rising costs of woodworking supplies had me questioning my priorities. Was this project still aligned with my goals, or was it time to pivot? The delay was a blessing in disguise, giving me time to reflect on what truly mattered.
