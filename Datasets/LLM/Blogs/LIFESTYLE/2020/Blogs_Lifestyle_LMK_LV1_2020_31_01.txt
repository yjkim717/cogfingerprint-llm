"Fasting during Ramadan 2020 was tough, but managing dry mouth while on medication was a real challenge. I found myself reaching for sugar-free candy to ease the discomfort. But I knew that wasn't a long-term solution. Has anyone else struggled with this? How did you cope? I'm looking for tips on how to stay hydrated and comfortable while fasting and taking my meds. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
