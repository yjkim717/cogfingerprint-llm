## The Static in My Life (and My Headphones)

2020, right? The year that felt like a constant hum of… something. For me, it manifested in unexpected ways. Beyond the news cycle and the general sense of unease, it showed up in my System76 Lemur Pro. I’d upgraded to Fedora 32, excited for the new features, but my trusty 3.5mm headphone jack started acting up. Static. Crackling. Volume that would swing wildly from whisper to blare.

It was frustrating, especially when I was trying to focus on work or just de-stress with some music. I even switched to Bluetooth headphones, a compromise I wasn’t thrilled about. But the static felt like a metaphor, honestly. All that background noise in the world, the constant disruption… it was seeping into everything.  I'm hoping a driver update will solve the headphone issue, but more than that, I hope we all find a way to filter out some of the static in our lives soon.
