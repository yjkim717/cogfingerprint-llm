**The Quiet Obsession with a Glass of Neat**

It’s weird, right? Scrolling through 2020’s streaming landscape – every rom-com, every action flick – the same thing kept popping up. Characters, in their cozy apartments or tense roadside scenes, were *always* nursing a glass of straight liquor. Whiskey, bourbon, gin… never a splash of soda, a bit of juice, or even just ice. 

I started noticing it too. Was it a reflection of our own anxieties? A desire for a stark, uncomplicated moment? It felt oddly… lonely, this pervasive preference for the pure, unmixed drink.  Maybe it’s just good storytelling, but it stuck with me.
