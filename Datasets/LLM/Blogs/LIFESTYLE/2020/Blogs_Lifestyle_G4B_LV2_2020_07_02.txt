**The Skillet and the Space**

It’s funny how a single piece of cookware can suddenly become a symbol of a bigger problem, isn’t it?  Early 2020, I was wrestling with my beloved 15” Lodge cast iron skillet. It’s a family heirloom, gorgeous and reliable, but it *loves* to take up space.  

I was desperately trying to find a larger stovetop – something to properly accommodate it and, honestly, to stop the frustrating uneven heating I was experiencing. It felt ridiculous, I know, worrying about a skillet! But it highlighted a bigger issue: my tiny kitchen and the feeling that I was constantly crammed. 

It made me realize I needed to think beyond just the skillet; it was a reminder to re-evaluate my space and what truly mattered.  Sometimes, the smallest things can point you right back to yourself.
