**Decluttering My Life (and Helping the Planet!)**

It feels a little strange to be writing this in 2020, amidst everything… but I wanted to share a small win. Last month, I finally tackled that mountain of old electronics in my garage. Seriously, it was a beast! I took everything to Forest Planet for recycling, and it felt *amazing* to do something productive. 

Knowing that those discarded phones and chargers were being turned into something new, and that Forest Planet was even planting trees as a result, was such a good feeling. It reminded me that even little actions – like a garage cleanup – can make a difference.  It’s a tiny step towards a more conscious lifestyle, and honestly, it left me feeling lighter and more hopeful.
