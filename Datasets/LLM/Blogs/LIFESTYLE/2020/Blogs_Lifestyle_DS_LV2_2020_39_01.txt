It’s 2020, and I’m stuck at home, scrolling through endless advice on manifestation. So I tried it: scribbling goals in a notebook, whispering affirmations each morning. At first, it felt silly. But slowly, gratitude crept in—for health, quiet moments, even uncertainty. Maybe the magic wasn’t in the universe answering, but in me showing up, ready to grow. And that’s a start worth celebrating.
