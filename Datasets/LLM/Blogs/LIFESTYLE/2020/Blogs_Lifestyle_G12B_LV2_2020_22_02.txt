>## That Creepy Basement Feeling (and Why You Shouldn't Ignore It)

Okay, let's be real. 2020 has been… a lot. Between the news and everything else, sometimes the little things slip through the cracks. Like, for example, the slightly unsettling feeling I've had in our basement for a while now. 

Turns out, that feeling might have been more than just my imagination. We just got our house tested for radon, and the results weren't great - 5-9 pCi/L. Suddenly, that musty smell and the lingering chill felt a lot more significant. 

It's a stark reminder that home safety isn't just about smoke detectors and locked doors. It's about the invisible things, the silent threats.  I'm diving into radon mitigation now, and honestly, it’s a little overwhelming. But knowing we're taking action, protecting our family… that makes a difference.  Anyone else dealing with this? Let's share tips!
