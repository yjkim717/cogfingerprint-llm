**The Ghostly Buzz: Why I Needed to Stop Checking Reddit**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How something designed to connect us can sometimes feel utterly isolating? 2020 was… a lot.  I found myself retreating into the familiar glow of my laptop screen, specifically, the endless scroll of Reddit. Mostly, I was lurking in /r/stopdrinking, a community built on shared struggle and cautious hope.

But then, the notifications started. Not the helpful ones – “Someone commented on your post!” – but a constant, insistent buzz about user flair changes and experimental features. It felt… intrusive. Like a little ghost was vibrating with every update, pulling me back into the comparison game, the self-doubt. 

I realized I was spending more time *reacting* to Reddit than actually *living*.  It was a vicious cycle.  So, after a particularly frustrating evening, I decided to take a step back.  It turned out, a temporary fix for notification glitches in /r/stopdrinking was all it took.  Simple, really, but it felt like a tiny victory.  Sometimes, the biggest wins are about reclaiming your attention, one notification at a time.

Would you like me to revise this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different length?
