**The Quiet Worry in the Basement**

It’s funny how anxieties can creep in, don’t you? 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic and everything uncertain, I found myself obsessing over the little things. Like the basement. My husband and I had just bought our first house, and during a quick inspection, we’d been told about elevated radon levels. 

Suddenly, I was picturing it – a slow, invisible threat. Was it worth the cost of mitigation? The thought kept me up at night. It felt strangely connected to all the other worries swirling around – a small, contained problem in a world of big unknowns.  It made me realize how important it is to address those quiet, persistent concerns, even if they seem small.
