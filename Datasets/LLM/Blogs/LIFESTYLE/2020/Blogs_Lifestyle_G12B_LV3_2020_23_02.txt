## That Frustrating Feeling of Almost There

Anyone else feeling 2020's relentless grind? I was chasing a Stasis chest in Destiny 2 – a little reward for completing the Europa Legs quest. Except… bug. Just stopped me dead. It’s a weird parallel, isn't it? Working towards something, feeling so close, and then *bam*, a roadblock. Makes you pause and remember that sometimes, even when you’ve done everything right, life throws a curveball. Gotta take a breath and find another way, I guess.
