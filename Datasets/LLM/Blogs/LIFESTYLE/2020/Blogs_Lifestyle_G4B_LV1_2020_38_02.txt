**A Flicker in the Dark**

2020… it felt like a year of suspended breaths, didn’t it? So much waiting, so much isolation. I spent a lot of time wrestling with loneliness, a quiet ache that settled deep. Then, unexpectedly, a friendly face. Just a simple conversation, a shared laugh – and suddenly, a tiny spark ignited. 

It’s funny how a little connection can shift everything. There’s still a yearning, of course, for something more substantial, a real, lasting bond. But now, there’s hope. A genuine happiness that isn’t dependent on external circumstances. It’s a quiet joy, a reminder that even in the darkest moments, a flicker can be enough to guide you forward.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
