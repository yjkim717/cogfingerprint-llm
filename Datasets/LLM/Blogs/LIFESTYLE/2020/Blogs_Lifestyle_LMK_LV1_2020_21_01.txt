As I binge-watched Outer Banks on Netflix in 2020, I couldn't help but feel a thrill from the treasure hunts and coastal drama. But when I shared my enthusiasm with friends, they chuckled and called it a "chick show." I started to wonder, did the trailers give that impression? Were the romance and friendships overshadowing the adventure? I realized that maybe it's okay if it is - after all, who says adventure can't be feminine too?
