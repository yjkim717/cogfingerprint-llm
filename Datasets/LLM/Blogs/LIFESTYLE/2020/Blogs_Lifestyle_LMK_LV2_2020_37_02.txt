"Cosplay Chaos: My Wig Woes at Conventions"

As I geared up for my first 2020 comic-con, I realized I was in for a wild ride - literally. My lace front wig kept slipping, and I was at a loss for how to keep it in place. After frantic online searches, I discovered the magic of wig adhesives. But with great power comes great responsibility: cleaning off the residue was a whole new challenge. I learned the hard way that a little spirit gum remover goes a long way. Now, my cosplay game is stronger than ever - and my wig stays put, no matter the costume.
