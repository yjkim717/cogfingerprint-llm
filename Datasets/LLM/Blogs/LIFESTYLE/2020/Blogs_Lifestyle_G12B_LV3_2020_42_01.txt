## The Grind and the Gaming Community

Anyone else finding themselves sinking a little *too* much time into Madden 21 these days? It's 2020, after all, and sometimes escaping into a virtual world feels pretty good. I'm currently on a quest for that elusive Platinum trophy on PlayStation, specifically needing that tricky "head to head" one. It's a reminder that even in gaming, we often need a little help from our community. Anyone willing to team up? I'm happy to return the favor!
