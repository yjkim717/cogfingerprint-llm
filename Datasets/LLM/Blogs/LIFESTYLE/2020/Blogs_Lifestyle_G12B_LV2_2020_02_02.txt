## The Weight of Digital Trophies

It’s 2020, and even online, we’re collecting things. Lately, I’ve been staring at my Reddit awards – a bizarre digital pile of gold and silver. It feels… overwhelming. Like a constant, low-level pressure to earn more. I miss the simplicity of just *sharing* something I found interesting. Maybe decluttering my digital life should start with a serious cull of these little trophies. Anyone else feel this way?
