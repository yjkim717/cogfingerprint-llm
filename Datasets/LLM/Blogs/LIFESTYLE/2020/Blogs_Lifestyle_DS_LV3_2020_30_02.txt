It’s 2020, and I’ve been revisiting old movies—like Rocky IV. Watching it now, I can’t help but wonder: what if Chernobyl had reshaped its plot? That disaster humanized the "enemy," softening Cold War tensions. Instead of a clear-cut villain, maybe Rocky would’ve faced a more nuanced opponent, reflecting our own struggles with fear and empathy. It reminds me how real-world events quietly steer the stories we tell—and how we see ourselves in them. Life imitates art, and vice versa.
