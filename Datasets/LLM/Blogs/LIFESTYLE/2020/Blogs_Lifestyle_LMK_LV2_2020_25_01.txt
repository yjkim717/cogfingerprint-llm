As I sat at my desk in 2020, staring at my screen in frustration, I couldn't help but think of my RuneScape hardcore account that I just couldn't log into. It was like being stuck in a rut, unable to progress or even access my progress. I tried every troubleshooting step I could think of, but nothing worked. It was then that I realized, just like in gaming, life can get stuck too. Sometimes, you need to step back, take a deep breath, and seek help. And that's exactly what I did, reaching out to Jagex for support.
