## Letting Go of the Big, Embracing the… Just Right

It’s funny how sometimes the biggest, flashiest thing isn’t actually what you need. For months, I was completely enamored with my Samsung Note 20 Ultra. It was a powerhouse – a gorgeous, massive screen, a stylus that felt like an extension of my hand, and enough processing power to run a small country. I loved showing it off, loved the sheer scale of it. It felt…important.

But 2020 has been about reassessing importance, hasn’t it? Stripping away the excess and focusing on what *actually* brings joy and ease. And slowly, I realized my phone was contributing to the opposite. That enormous screen meant an enormous pocket, a constant weight, and a battery that, despite its capacity, felt like it was always on the verge of dying.

So, I did something a little crazy. I switched to a Google Pixel 5. 

It's…smaller. Significantly. And honestly? It’s been incredibly freeing. I can actually use it one-handed now. The battery life is a delightful surprise – I'm consistently getting through a full day without needing to reach for a charger.  It’s not about having the absolute *best* camera (though the Pixel’s is fantastic, especially for quick snaps), it’s about capturing memories without the fuss. I've also found I'm using Google Photos more, appreciating the seamless backup and organization.

This isn't just about phones, I think. It's about realizing that sometimes, less is more.  It's about prioritizing practicality and joy over sheer size and spectacle. 2020 has been a year of letting go of things that don’t truly serve us, and for me, that included a phone that felt more like a burden than a tool.  And right now, this little Pixel is feeling pretty perfect.
