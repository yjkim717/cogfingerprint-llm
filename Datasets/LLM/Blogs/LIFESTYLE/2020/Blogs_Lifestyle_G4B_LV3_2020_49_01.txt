Okay, here’s a blog post draft inspired by the summary and keywords, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 158 words, set in 2020:

**Lost in Translation… and Bank Statements**

2020 felt like a constant state of ‘adjusting,’ didn’t it? For me, that meant being an expat, juggling income in Euros with bills in dollars, and generally feeling utterly bewildered by currency exchange rates. It was a stressful dance! I’d been using You Need a Budget (YNAB) for years, but suddenly, it felt… insufficient. 

I needed something more granular. That’s when I started experimenting with Aspire, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer. Setting up multiple accounts to mirror my different currencies felt like a huge weight lifted. Now, I can *actually* see where every penny is going – from that unexpected coffee in Paris to a small investment back home. 

Tracking everything, from income to liabilities, has given me a level of control I desperately needed. It’s not just about numbers; it’s about feeling grounded in a constantly shifting landscape.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a slightly different angle (e.g., the emotional aspect of managing finances abroad)?
