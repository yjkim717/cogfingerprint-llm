The phone call came at 2:17 AM, that particular hour reserved for parental dread. My daughter’s voice was thin, a wisp of the confident young woman we’d dropped off at college just a month earlier. “Mom, I have a fever. They think it’s COVID. I have to quarantine in my dorm.”

An eight-hour drive. That’s what stood between my maternal instinct and my child, alone and scared. 2020 had already rewritten every rule, but this was a new, cruel test. My mind became a war room of pros and cons. I pictured packing a care package, holding her, the sheer relief on her face. Then, the other images flickered: bringing the virus home, my elderly parents, the very real risk.

Parenting from a distance suddenly felt like the hardest job I’d ever had. All the old scripts—a hug, chicken soup, a reassuring touch on the forehead—were useless. We were navigating this strange new world with a map that kept changing. The desire to protect her was a physical ache, a primal pull against the logical, terrifying fear of what I might carry back.

In the end, we decided on a compromise born of this bizarre era. I wouldn’t drive. Instead, we scheduled daily video calls, I ordered groceries to her door, and I left a heartfelt note for her roommate to tape to her wall. It wasn’t the same. It felt like parenting through a pane of glass. But in a year where love so often had to be expressed from six feet—or 480 miles—away, it was the safest way to say, “I’m here.”
