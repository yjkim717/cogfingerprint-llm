### The Heart of the Machine: More Than Just Parts

It was the summer of 2020, and my world had shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. With nowhere to go, I decided to finally build the PC I’d always dreamed of—a true powerhouse for gaming and design work. I spent weeks agonizing over the specs, spreadsheets filled with motherboard, CPU, and GPU comparisons. It felt like a high-stakes puzzle where every dollar counted.

But as the parts arrived and I began the careful assembly, something shifted. It wasn't just about raw performance anymore. Slotting the CPU into the motherboard felt like giving the machine a brain; connecting the GPU was like giving it a soul. This wasn't just a cost-saving exercise; it was a creative act. In a year when so much felt out of my control, building something tangible, piece by piece, became a deeply personal anchor. My PC isn't just a tool; it's a reminder that even from disconnected parts, we can create a whole that’s greater than the sum of its parts.
