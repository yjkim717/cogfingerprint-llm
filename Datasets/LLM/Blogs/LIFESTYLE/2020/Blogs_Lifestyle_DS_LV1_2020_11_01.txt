It’s 2020, and I’m trying to find quiet moments wherever I can. My new laptop—a System76 Lemur Pro—was supposed to be my trusty sidekick for late-night writing sessions. But plugging in my old wired headphones, I’m met with faint, crackling static. The volume barely rises above a whisper, no matter how high I turn it up. It’s like the world itself is resisting clarity.

Switching to Bluetooth headphones, the noise vanishes. The irony isn’t lost on me: sometimes, letting go of the familiar—even something as simple as a cord—brings peace. In a year of so much uncertainty, maybe it’s a small reminder to adapt, to find stillness in new ways.
