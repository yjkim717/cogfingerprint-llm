The holiday rush of 2020 was unlike any other. In our small grocery store, we were one of the few places open, a beacon of normalcy in a year that was anything but. I remember the constant, anxious lineâ€”not just at the registers, but for our single employee restroom.

A sign clearly read "Employees Only," but the plea in a customer's eyes was a language everyone understood. "Just a quick moment," they'd say, and how could I refuse? We were all just trying to get through the day.

But by my third break, the consequences were undeniable. The line was longer, and an unfortunate smell had begun to linger, a stark contrast to the pine-scented air fresheners we'd hung. I felt a pang of resentment. This was my one small sanctuary.

Then it hit me. That cramped, overused room was a microcosm of 2020 itself. We were all sharing limited resources, navigating shared discomfort, and just doing our best to maintain a little dignity. I stopped seeing rule-breakers and started seeing people, just like me, searching for a moment of peace.
