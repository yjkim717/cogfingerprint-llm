## The Year I Stopped Measuring My Worth in Pounds (and Everything Else)

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn’t it? A year of… well, *everything*. Global pandemic, political upheaval, and for me, a quiet, internal reckoning. It wasn’t a dramatic overnight shift, more like a slow, blurry picture gradually coming into focus.

For years, I'd been caught in the relentless cycle of dieting. The magazines, the influencers, the constant hum of "lose weight, be happy," it all seeped in. I’d fluctuate, lose a few pounds, feel a fleeting sense of accomplishment, then inevitably… rebound. It was exhausting, honestly. And it was fueled by a deep-seated belief that my worth was somehow tied to a number on a scale.

Then 2020 hit. Suddenly, the world felt… precarious. My daily anxieties about fitting into a certain dress size seemed ridiculously trivial in the face of everything else happening.  I remember scrolling through Instagram, seeing yet another "transformation Tuesday" post, and feeling a wave of… not envy, exactly, but a profound sadness. Sadness for the person who thought that dramatic change was the key to happiness.

This year forced me to slow down. Stuck at home, deprived of my usual distractions, I started paying attention to *myself*. Not my body, not my weight, but *myself*. I started noticing how much energy I wasted obsessing over things that truly didn’t matter. I rediscovered hobbies I'd abandoned – reading, painting, simply *being* without the pressure to be productive or, you know, *perfect*.

It’s not to say I suddenly woke up one day a champion of body positivity. It’s been a gradual process. A conscious effort to challenge those ingrained beliefs. To recognize that my value isn’t determined by the size of my jeans or the number on the scale. It’s determined by my kindness, my creativity, my relationships, my resilience. 

And honestly?  It's been incredibly freeing. The anxiety has lessened, the self-criticism has quieted, and I feel… lighter.  Maybe 2020 wasn't just about surviving a pandemic. Maybe it was about finally giving myself permission to just *be*. To accept myself, flaws and all, and to find joy in the simple act of existing.  It’s a work in progress, definitely, but I’m finally on a path that feels authentic and, dare I say, joyful.
