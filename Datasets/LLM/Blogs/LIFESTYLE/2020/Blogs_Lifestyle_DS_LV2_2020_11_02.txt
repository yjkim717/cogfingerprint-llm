Of course, here is a reflective blog post written from the perspective of someone in 2020, finding unexpected peace in a hands-on project.

### The Server in the Closet and the Year We Paused

It started with a blinking green light. In the back of my closet, amidst forgotten winter coats and old shoes, I’d tucked a small Raspberry Pi computer. In the great stillness of 2020, its persistent, quiet blink became a kind of heartbeat for me.

You see, my world, like so many others, had shrunk to the four walls of my home. The frantic pace of "before" was replaced by a strange, anxious quiet. I was drowning in a sea of news alerts and Zoom calls, feeling utterly disconnected from anything tangible.

Then I remembered the little computer. On a whim, I decided to turn it into a home server. I spent an entire afternoon following online guides, my fingers fumbling with tiny screws and cryptic lines of code. I was trying to set up a personal cloud, a tiny digital space that was entirely my own.

There was a moment of sheer frustration when nothing worked. But then, a breakthrough. A single command, typed correctly, and it all sprang to life. That little device was now serving files, hosting a photo album for my family, doing something real.

It hit me then. In a year where we lost so much control, this was a small kingdom I had built with my own hands. It wasn’t about the technology; it was about the act of creation. The satisfaction wasn't in the result, but in the focused, patient journey there. While the world felt like it was falling apart, I was quietly building a small, orderly corner of it, one line of code and one connected cable at a time.

That blinking light in the closet is now a gentle reminder. Progress isn't always loud and fast. Sometimes, it’s a quiet project that reminds you of your own capacity to make, fix, and find a little peace.
