**The Weight of Waiting, and the Unexpected Lift**

2020… it feels like a year etched in quiet moments and a lot of “waiting.” I spent a good chunk of it wrestling with a familiar feeling – loneliness. Not the dramatic, cinematic kind, but that dull, persistent ache of feeling disconnected. Then, almost unexpectedly, something shifted. 

It wasn’t a grand gesture, just a simple, genuine offer of connection from someone who *saw* me. Suddenly, a flicker of hope ignited. It’s strange, isn’t it? How a little bit of real, human kindness can completely reroute your perspective. 

I realized that happiness isn't a destination; it’s often found in the moments of waiting, of leaning into the possibility of connection.  This isn't about erasing the loneliness entirely – it's about knowing you’re not alone in waiting for it to fade, and that hope, surprisingly, can bloom even in the quietest of spaces.
