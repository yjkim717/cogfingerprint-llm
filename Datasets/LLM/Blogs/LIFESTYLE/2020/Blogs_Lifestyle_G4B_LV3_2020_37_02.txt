**The Weight of the Wig – And a Sticky Situation**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of unexpected challenges, didn’t it? I was deep into my cosplay hobby, pouring all my energy into creating a really intricate character, and that meant a lot of wig work. Specifically, a gorgeous, heavy lace front. But let me tell you, attaching and removing it was a *battle*. 

I’d tried everything – spirit gum, which just refused to budge, and nail glue, which left this stubborn, sticky residue everywhere. It was frustrating, to say the least! It felt like a small, persistent problem mirroring the bigger anxieties of the year - something that just wouldn’t let go. 

It made me realize how easily we get bogged down in the details, especially when we’re chasing a creative vision.  Sometimes, the most important thing isn’t mastering the technique, but finding a gentle, patient approach.  Anyone else have a project this year that felt stubbornly resistant?
