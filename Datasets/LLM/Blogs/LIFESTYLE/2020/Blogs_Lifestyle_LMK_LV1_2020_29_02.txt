"As I binge-watched Netflix documentaries in 2020, I stumbled upon some truly inspiring stories. 'The Last Dance' was a huge hit for me, but I also devoured 'Free Solo' and 'The Social Dilemma.' These films didn't just captivate me - they motivated me to re-evaluate my own life. If you're looking for a similar boost, I highly recommend 'I Am a Killer' and 'The Great Hack.' These documentaries will challenge your perspectives and leave you feeling empowered. So, grab some popcorn and get ready to be inspired by the incredible stories streaming on Netflix right now!"
