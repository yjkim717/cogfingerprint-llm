It’s 2020, and like so many of us, I found myself spending more time at home, searching for a project to pour my energy into. My little planted aquarium became my sanctuary—but something was missing. My plants weren’t thriving, and I couldn’t justify the cost of a high-end CO2 system.

That’s when I stumbled upon the magic of DIY CO2. I remember the afternoon I decided to rig up a simple yeast-based generator. The real challenge was diffusion. My first attempt with a basic airstone just created a storm of distracting micro bubbles. Then came the "aha" moment: I connected the CO2 line directly into my HOB filter intake.

Watching those tiny bubbles get chopped into an even finer mist and distributed throughout the tank was pure satisfaction. It wasn't just about the science; it was a lesson in resourcefulness. In a year that felt so uncertain, this small, affordable victory in my own living room was a quiet reminder that sometimes the best solutions are born from a little creativity and a willingness to experiment.
