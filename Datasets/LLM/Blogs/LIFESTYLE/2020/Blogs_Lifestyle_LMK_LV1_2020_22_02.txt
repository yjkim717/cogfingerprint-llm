"As I stared at the alarming reading on my radon detector - a whopping 8 pci/l in my basement - I couldn't help but wonder if I was overreacting. With COVID-19 dominating every news headline in 2020, it seemed almost trivial to worry about radon mitigation. But as I dug deeper, I realized that ignoring the issue wouldn't make it go away. In fact, high radon levels can be just as deadly as the pandemic. I decided to take action, and schedule a mitigation system installation. My health - and peace of mind - were worth it."
