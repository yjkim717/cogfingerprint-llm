## The Little Glitches That Get You

Isn't it funny how life throws these tiny, frustrating roadblocks at you? I've been wrestling with Minecraft Earth all afternoon. My iPad Pro, usually a powerhouse, is refusing to let me log in. Sisu.xboxlive.com, apparently, is the gatekeeper. I’ve restarted the game, the iPad, everything! 

It's just… a game. But it feels symbolic, you know? Like all the bigger things we’re navigating in 2020 – the unexpected pauses, the digital hurdles – it’s about persistence. Taking a deep breath, trying again, and hoping the little digital gatekeeper finally lets you through. Sometimes, that’s all you *can* do.
