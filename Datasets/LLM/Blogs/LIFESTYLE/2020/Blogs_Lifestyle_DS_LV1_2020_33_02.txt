### The Scale Broke, and So Did My Thinking

It was March 2020, and the world had shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. Like many, I was grappling with a sudden loss of control. My weird coping mechanism? I became obsessed with my bathroom scale. Every morning, that cold digital readout felt like a verdict on my worth. Gaining a pound was a personal failure; losing one, a fleeting victory in a war I was losing.

Then, one Tuesday, it happened. I stepped on, and the screen flickered and died. Just like that. No final number, no judgment. Just silence.

In that quiet, something shifted. Stuck at home, my body wasn't an ornament to be judged anymore; it was the vessel that carried me through panic attacks, the arms that hugged my partner, the legs that paced during endless Zoom calls. I started following body-positive creators online—people of all sizes and abilities who talked about joyful movement and eating for energy, not punishment. They were fat, thin, disabled, and all radiantly unapologetic.

Their message challenged everything I thought I knew. I’d always conflated "health" with "thinness," assuming anyone in a larger body was automatically unhealthy. But these folks were talking about blood pressure, mental well-being, and mobility with a nuance I’d never considered. I realized my frantic weighing was the truly disordered behavior, not a path to "health."

Unlearning a lifetime of societal conditioning isn't easy. Some days, the old voices whisper. But 2020 forced a collective reckoning, and for me, that started in my own skin. The body positivity movement gave me the language to see that my worth was never in a number, but in my capacity for joy, for resilience, and for kindness—to others, and finally, to myself.

The scale is still in my closet, a relic of a past life. I’m in no rush to replace it. I’m too busy living in this body, just as it is.
