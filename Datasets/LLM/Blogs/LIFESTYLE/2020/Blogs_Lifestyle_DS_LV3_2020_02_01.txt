The hum of our rented minivan became the soundtrack to our 2020 Alaskan escape. With social distancing the new travel mantra, we sought more than just scenery; we craved genuine connection. We carefully charted a course towards small communities rumored to welcome cautious travelers. Pulling into a quiet, coastal town, the wave from a local fisherman on the dock said it all. In a year that taught us to stay apart, this road trip reminded us how to find our way back together, one respectful mile at a time.
