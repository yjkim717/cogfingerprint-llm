It’s 2020, and my workdays had started to blur into one long, gray Zoom call. I felt drained, uninspired—like I was just going through the motions. Then I stumbled on the idea of "Work Cycles."

Instead of grinding for hours, I started breaking my day into focused 90-minute sprints. In between, I’d step away completely—stretch, make tea, or just stare out the window. It felt strange at first, almost like I was slacking off. But something shifted.

Those small breaks became little oases. I wasn’t just checking tasks off a list; I was giving my brain space to breathe. My mindset changed, and so did my work. It became less about enduring the day and more about engaging with it. Now, my desk isn’t just a place I work—it’s a space where I feel present, motivated, and curiously more alive. Funny how a little structure can set you free.
