"As remote work became the norm in 2020, I turned to Hyper-V to create a virtual lab for testing new networking setups. However, I hit a snag - I wanted my virtual machines to access the host network, but still be able to wake the host using Wake-on-LAN. After some trial and error, I discovered that configuring an external switch on my standard ethernet adapter was the key. It was a small victory, but it made a big difference in my productivity. It reminded me that sometimes, it's the little tech tweaks that can greatly impact our lifestyle and work habits."
