As a casual gamer, I've been torn between upgrading my PS4 Pro gaming experience with a new headset. The RIG 500 series caught my eye, but I was stuck between models with 7.1 Stereo and Dolby Atmos. I realized that immersive gaming audio isn't just about surround sound - it's about being transported into the game. Dolby Atmos won me over, offering a more nuanced and realistic experience. For me, it's not just about the tech, but how it enhances my gaming sessions and draws me in.
