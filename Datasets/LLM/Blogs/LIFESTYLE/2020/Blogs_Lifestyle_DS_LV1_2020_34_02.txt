Looking back on those long 2020 evenings, my PS4 Pro was my escape. But my old headset was letting me down. I was just a casual player, not a pro, so I needed something affordable. I found myself deep in forums, comparing the RIG 500 models. The debate was real: the immersive 7.1 stereo or the more advanced Dolby Atmos? It wasn't just about specs; it was about finding that perfect, budget-friendly gear to make my little corner of the world sound richer. A small upgrade that made a world of difference.
