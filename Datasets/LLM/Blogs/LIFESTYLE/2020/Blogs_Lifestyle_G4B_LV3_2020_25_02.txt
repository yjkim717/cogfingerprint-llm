**The Weight of a Wagging Tail**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2020 was *rough*. Between the pandemic, the isolation, and the general uncertainty swirling around, I was already teetering on the edge of a pretty serious anxiety spiral. Then, out of the blue, my partner decided *now* was the perfect time for a dog. A golden retriever puppy named Gus. 

Suddenly, my carefully constructed (and admittedly fragile) student life was overflowing with chewed slippers, muddy paw prints, and a constant need for walks – even when I desperately needed to just…exist.  I adored Gus, truly. His goofy grin and the way he’d flop onto my lap were pure, unadulterated joy. But it quickly morphed into a heavy feeling, this unsettling mix of guilt and overwhelm. 

Was I being a bad student? A bad partner?  Was I *capable* of responsibly caring for a living creature when my own life felt so unstable?  It was a ridiculous thought, I know, but it clung to me. 

Looking back, I realize it wasn’t about *if* I was capable, but about learning to balance.  It’s about accepting that sometimes, the biggest responsibility isn't about checking off a to-do list, but about giving a little bit of your heart to something – and letting it fill you up in return. Gus taught me that, one wagging tail at a time.
