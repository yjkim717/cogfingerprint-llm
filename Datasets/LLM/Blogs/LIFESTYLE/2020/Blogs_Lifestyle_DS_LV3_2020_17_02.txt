The date circled on my 2020 calendar felt less like a milestone and more like a countdown to judgment day: my driving theory test. With the world outside my window turned upside down, my little bubble of anxiety revolved entirely around this one exam. I’d spent weeks buried in revision books, the highway code becoming my bizarre pandemic bible. I could recite stopping distances in my sleep.

But the hazard perception part? That was my nemesis. The practice clips on the screen felt like cruel logic puzzles. Click too soon, and you’re over-eager; click a second too late, and you’ve missed it. My heart would do a little syncopated rhythm every time a car emerged from a side road or a pedestrian stepped off the curb in those simulations. It wasn't just about knowing the rules; it was about predicting chaos, and my own anxiety was the biggest hazard of all.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t seriously consider the big "P"—postpone. Just delay the inevitable. What was one more cancelled plan in a year full of them? But something stubborn in me pushed back. This was one thing I could still control, one goal I could still achieve from my living room. So, I took a deep breath, closed my eyes for a moment, and clicked "resume test." Passing this wasn't just about getting a license; in the strange stillness of 2020, it felt like proving to myself I could still move forward.
