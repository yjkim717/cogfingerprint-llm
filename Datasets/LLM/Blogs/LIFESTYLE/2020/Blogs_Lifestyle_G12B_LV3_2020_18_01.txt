## The Tiny Screen & The Big To-Do List: A 2020 Working Parent Reality

Okay, let's be honest, 2020 threw *everything* at us, didn't it? For me, that meant juggling a full-time job while navigating toddlerhood. Suddenly, my two-year-old’s need for entertainment became a very real, and sometimes overwhelming, part of my workday. 

I started searching for those elusive "educational YouTube" channels – short, engaging clips that wouldn't completely derail my focus. It felt a little guilty, I won't lie. But finding a few gems – bright colors, simple songs, and gentle lessons – has been a lifeline. It’s not about replacing playtime, of course, but about those precious 20 minutes when I *really* need to concentrate. Anyone else feeling this constant balancing act?
