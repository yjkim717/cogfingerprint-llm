As I sat down to game on my PS4 Pro in 2020, I found myself pondering the perfect headset. I was torn between the immersive 7.1 Stereo and the spatial audio of Dolby Atmos. My casual play sessions were about to get a serious upgrade. I considered the Rig 500 series, a top-notch gaming headset, and how it would enhance my experience. In the end, I wanted a headset that would transport me into the game. The decision wasn't easy, but I was excited to dive in and level up my gaming sessions.
