**The Weight of Endless Loops**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we can get stuck in a rut, even when chasing something exciting. 2020 was *that* year. I dove headfirst into the Vigilant mod for *Dark Souls*, desperately seeking that same punishing, rewarding loop I loved in the original game. It looked incredible, all gothic grandeur and promises of epic Daedra battles. 

But it was… dull. Just relentlessly difficult without a real sense of progression, a frustrating repetition. It mirrored a feeling I had a lot that year – pushing myself without actually *feeling* like I was moving forward. Sometimes, the most valiant effort isn’t about grinding, but about recognizing when to step back and find a different path.  Maybe that’s a lesson even a Dark Souls veteran needs to learn.
