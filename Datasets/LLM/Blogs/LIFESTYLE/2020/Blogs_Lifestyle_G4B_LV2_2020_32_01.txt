**Yearning for Asphalt & Coffee: My Pandemic Road Trip Dream**

It felt like 2020 was perpetually stuck on repeat, didn’t it? Here in Seattle, the grey skies and quiet streets were a constant reminder of… well, everything. I started craving something *more* – a real escape.  Suddenly, the idea of a solo road trip started bubbling up.
