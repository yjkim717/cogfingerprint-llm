It’s funny how 2020 taught me to stock up on little joys—like those legendary gems in Forager. I used to pass them by, thinking, "I’ll get one later." But later, they were gone. Now, I treat moments of peace or a good book like cosmic steel from a traveling merchant: rare, precious. I gather them while I can. Because when the world feels like a void, those small lights—like lighthouses—guide me home. Don’t wait to collect what matters.
