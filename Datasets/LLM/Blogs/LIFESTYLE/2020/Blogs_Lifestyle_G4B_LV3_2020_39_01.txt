**Finding My North Star in 2020**

It feels a little silly admitting this, but 2020 was a year I really needed a compass. I’d been drifting, vaguely aware I wanted *more* – a feeling I started trying to capture with goal-setting, gratitude lists, and those cheesy self-affirmations. Honestly, it felt forced at first. 

Then, I started to realize it wasn’t about ticking boxes, but about cultivating a genuine sense of appreciation for what *is*.  Connecting with my inner spirituality, practicing self-compassion when I missed the mark... that’s where the real magic began.  It’s a journey, not a destination, right?
