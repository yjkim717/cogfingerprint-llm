Remember my grand plan to digitize my entire life? I downloaded OneNote 2010, ready to sync my online notebook across all devices. It worked perfectly on my phone and browser, a seamless digital brain. But my trusty desktop app? It threw a fit over the file name, claiming some obscure error. There were no special characters, just pure, simple text. It was 2020, and my own systems couldn't even agree on how to talk to each other.

It was a tiny, frustrating metaphor for the year. We were all trying to connect, but the pathways were unexpectedly broken. It taught me that sometimes, the problem isn't the content of our lives, but the outdated frameworks we use to access it. Iâ€™m learning to be more flexible with my tools, and with myself.
