In the strange quiet of 2020, I found comfort in stories. My headphones became a portal, especially with audio dramas like *Bronzeville* and *Video Palace*. They were my consistent escape from the endless news cycle. Even the debate around *Video Palace’s* ending felt familiar—a shared, passionate conversation in a time of isolation. It reminded me that sometimes, the journey matters more than the destination, a lesson that perfectly fit that year of suspended plans and waiting.
