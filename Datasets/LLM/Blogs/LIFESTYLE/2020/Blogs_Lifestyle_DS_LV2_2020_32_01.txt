The open road called my name this weekend. With life feeling so confined, I packed a bag, pointed my car toward the Cascades, and just drove. No agenda, just me, the mountain air, and the profound peace of solitude. Sometimes the best way to reconnect is to deliberately disconnect, even for just 48 hours. My soul feels lighter already.
