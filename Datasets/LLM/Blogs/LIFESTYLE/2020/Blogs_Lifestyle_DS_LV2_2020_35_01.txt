It’s funny how life nudges you toward the past sometimes. Last week, I decided to build a new PC—something modest, around $800, to last me through the next few years of work and the occasional evening of light gaming. But as I sorted through parts, I found my old external optical drive, a relic from my college days.

In 2020, with so much of life shifting online, that little drive felt like a time capsule. I’d burned mix CDs on it, stored old photos, and now, it was just… sitting there. I realized this upgrade wasn’t just about specs or budget; it was about weaving pieces of my history into whatever comes next. Funny how a machine meant for the future can make you hold the past a little tighter.
