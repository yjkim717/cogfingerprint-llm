As I navigated 2020, I realized that simplicity was key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. With a busy schedule, I turned to easy and nutritious meals that didn't compromise on flavor. My trusty crock-pot became my best friend, allowing me to slow-cook chicken in a variety of sauces. I also fell in love with quick recipes like tilapia with lemon and broccoli. These simple meals gave me the energy to tackle the day, and I felt more grounded in my self-care routine. It was a small but significant step towards a healthier, happier me.
