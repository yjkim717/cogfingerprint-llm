### Finding My Glimmer in 2020

If you’d told me at the start of this year that my most trusted guides through the chaos would be a book about shame and a comedy about a rich family losing everything, I’m not sure I would have believed you. But here we are. As someone navigating sobriety, 2020 didn't just hand me a global crisis; it held up a brutally honest mirror.

In the eerie quiet of lockdown, all the noises I used to drown out my own thoughts were suddenly gone. My recovery program provided the scaffolding, but the real, gut-level work happened in the space between Zoom meetings. That’s when I finally picked up Brene Brown’s *Daring Greatly*. Her words on vulnerability weren’t just concepts; they were a direct challenge. She argues that vulnerability isn’t weakness, but the birthplace of courage. In a year where I felt utterly fragile, realizing that my shame around past mistakes was actually preventing my growth was a lightning bolt. It was okay to not be okay.

And then, there was the Rose family. *Schitt's Creek* became my unlikely therapy. At first, it was just a delightful escape. But as I watched Moira, Johnny, Alexis, and David slowly shed their pretenses and build genuine connections from nothing, I saw a reflection of my own journey. They arrived in that town with only their baggage, much like I arrived in sobriety. Their growth wasn’t about getting their wealth back; it was about discovering that their real value was in their vulnerability and love for each other.

David’s simple, beautiful line to Patrick, “I like you very much,” stripped of all performance, hit me harder than any dramatic monologue. It was a testament to the courage of showing up as you are.

So, in a year of profound loss, I found an unexpected gain. Between Brene’s research and the Roses’ heart, I learned that personal growth isn’t about building a fortress. It’s about having the courage to leave the door unlocked, trusting that what comes in—even if it’s uncomfortable—is what will help you truly, finally, bloom.
