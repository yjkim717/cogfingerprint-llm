"Rainy days always bring a dash of gloom, don't they? For me, it's not just the grey skies, but my trusty Ford Fiesta's stubborn refusal to start when wet. I've had this 1.4 petrol for years, but lately, it's been giving me grief. Is it just a coincidence or a sign of engine trouble? Anyone else having similar issues? I'm hoping it's just a simple fix, but I'm bracing myself for a costly repair."
