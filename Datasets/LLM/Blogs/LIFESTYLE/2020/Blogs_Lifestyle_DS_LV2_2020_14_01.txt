It’s 2020, and honestly, I’m just trying to keep it together. Between the news and working from my kitchen, my energy was shot. So, I went back to basics: simple, healthy meals. A tilapia filet with steamed broccoli, or my trusty crock-pot chicken I can dress up with anything—even just a scoop of garlic hummus. It’s not fancy, but it’s real. And in a year of chaos, that little bit of control and nourishment has been my quiet anchor.
