There’s a stack of pressure-treated lumber sitting in my garage, and every time I walk past it, I feel a little pang of guilt. I picked it up from Home Depot back in early 2020, right before the world seemed to tilt on its axis. The price felt steep then, but I figured I’d better start my backyard project before things got any crazier.

Now, here in the Midwest, the days are getting warmer, and that lumber is just… waiting. I read about prices possibly climbing even higher, and part of me wonders if I jumped the gun. Should I have waited? But then I look at my sketches for the new planter boxes and remember the hope I felt buying that wood. Maybe the real cost isn’t in the dollars, but in the time we spend hesitating. This year has taught me that some projects are worth starting, even when the numbers don’t quite add up.
