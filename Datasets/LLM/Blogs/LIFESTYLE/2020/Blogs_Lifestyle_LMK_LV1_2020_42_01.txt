As I sat on my couch in 2020, controller in hand, I realized gaming was my stress relief. I was stuck on Madden 21's 'head to head' trophy on PlayStation. The quest for platinum was on! I turned to online forums, seeking an opponent to conquer. It wasn't just about the trophy; it was about the thrill of competition. Anyone up for a friendly match?
