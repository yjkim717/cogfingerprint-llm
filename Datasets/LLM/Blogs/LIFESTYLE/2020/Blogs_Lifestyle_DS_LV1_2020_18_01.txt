Juggling work calls and a curious toddler in 2020 was our new normal. My laptop became my office, and the tablet, a temporary savior. I’d scroll through YouTube and Amazon Prime, hunting for shows that were more than just colorful noise. Finding that one channel where she’d actually count along with the characters felt like a tiny victory. It wasn't about unlimited screen time, but about making those precious 20 minutes count for both of us.
