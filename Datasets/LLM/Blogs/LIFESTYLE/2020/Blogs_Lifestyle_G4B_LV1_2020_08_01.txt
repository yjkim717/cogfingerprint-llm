**The Dirt and My Head – A Strange Spring**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? But amidst all the uncertainty, I had a really weird little episode. I’d been desperately trying to get my garden going – a little patch of green felt like a tiny victory against the gloom. I was digging, really getting into it, and suddenly, bam – a wave of dizziness hit me. 

Followed by this bizarre, almost coppery taste in my mouth. And a headache that just wouldn’t quit. It was so unsettling, especially with everything else going on. I spent a couple of days worrying, convinced it was something serious. 

Looking back, I think it was just my body reacting to the physical exertion and maybe a bit of pollen overload. It was a reminder that even the most wholesome activities can have unexpected consequences. It made me think about listening to my body, and maybe taking a little more time to actually *breathe* while I’m getting my hands dirty.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a post focused on a different aspect of the original summary?
