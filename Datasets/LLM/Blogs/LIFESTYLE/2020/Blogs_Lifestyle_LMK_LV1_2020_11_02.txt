"Embracing the Simple Life: How I Found Solace in Tech Experimentation"

As I sit here in my cozy home office, surrounded by the hum of Raspberry Pi devices and the soft glow of screens, I'm reminded of the journey that brought me here. It's 2020, and the world outside is chaotic, but in this little corner, I've found a sense of calm.

My latest obsession is setting up a Kubernetes cluster on my Raspberry Pi 4 devices. It's been a challenge, but a rewarding one. I've spent hours wrestling with networking configurations and figuring out how to get my Docker containers to communicate with each other. But the thrill of finally getting it working is addicting.

As I worked through the technical issues, I realized that this hobby is more than just a distraction from the world's problems – it's a reflection of my own values. I'm drawn to the simplicity and elegance of the Raspberry Pi, and the way it allows me to tinker and experiment. I've also set up an NFS share to store my data, which has taught me about the importance of persistence and data management.

In a world that's increasingly complex and overwhelming, I've found solace in the simple, tactile pleasure of working with these devices. It's a reminder that, even in the midst of chaos, there's beauty to be found in the details. As I continue to nurture my tech hobby, I'm reminded to appreciate the little things in life – and to never stop exploring.
