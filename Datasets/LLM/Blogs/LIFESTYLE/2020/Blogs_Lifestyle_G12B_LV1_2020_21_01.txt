>## Don't Knock the Beach Vibes, Okay?

Okay, confession time. I’ve been *really* into *Outer Banks* on Netflix. Like, mainlining it. And every time I mention it to my friends, I get this knowing look and a, "Oh, it's a *chick show*?" Honestly, it's a little insulting! 

Look, I get it. Treasure hunts, teen drama, sun-drenched beaches…it *sounds* fluffy. But there’s something so captivating about the whole thing. Plus, Sarah Cameron? Seriously, the effortless cool is just *chef's kiss*. 

2020 has been…a lot. Sometimes you just need a little escapism, a little adventure, and a whole lot of beautiful scenery. So, if you're looking for something to unwind with, don't judge a show by its potential "chick show" label. Just dive in and enjoy the ride. You might be surprised.
