As I hopped on my bike for a morning ride in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but notice the satisfying drop in weight on my scale afterward. I was burning calories, that was for sure. But as I dug deeper, I realized that the story wasn't so simple. Sure, I was torching energy, but how much of that weight loss was actually just water loss? And what about glycogen depletion - was my body using stored glucose for fuel? I've always been curious about the proportions. Is most of my weight loss during a ride just water weight, or is it actually fat being burned? I've read that glycogen depletion can play a significant role, especially during longer rides. I'd love to know more about the science behind it. If you're a fitness enthusiast or just someone who's curious about the intricacies of exercise, I'd love to hear your thoughts - let's dive into the details together!
