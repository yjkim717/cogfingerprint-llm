## Finding the Stars in the Static: A Year of Unexpected Grace

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn’t it? It's been a year of…well, *everything*. Uncertainty, loss, a global pandemic forcing us all into a weird, collective pause. For me, it's also been a year of a quiet, ongoing recovery. Not from anything dramatic, necessarily, but from a pattern of self-sabotage and a persistent belief that I wasn't quite *enough*.

It sounds cliché, I know. But the truth is, navigating this year, with all its anxieties, has really underscored the importance of leaning into vulnerability. It’s something I’ve been working on for a while, inspired by thinkers like Brené Brown, who champions the power of showing up, flaws and all. It's been a slow process, peeling back layers of carefully constructed armor. It's terrifying, letting yourself feel *that* much. But it’s also… liberating.

I've found solace in some really unexpected places this year. Like, seriously unexpected. Remember when everyone was suddenly obsessed with *Schitt’s Creek*? Yeah, me too. It started as a random recommendation, and I’m so glad I listened. The Rose family's journey from ridiculous wealth to…well, slightly less ridiculous poverty, and ultimately, to genuine connection, was the balm I didn’t realize I needed. It's a masterclass in finding joy in the mundane, in building community, and in accepting people – and yourself – for who they are.

And then there's been the reading. Escapism, sure, but also something deeper. I dove headfirst into space opera – big, sprawling stories of interstellar travel, complex characters, and the search for meaning in a vast, uncaring universe. Sounds heavy, right? But it’s also incredibly freeing. When you’re dealing with the overwhelming weight of *this* world, sometimes it helps to lose yourself in a galaxy far, far away.

It’s been a year of quiet moments, of small victories, of acknowledging the shadows and choosing to look for the light. It's a reminder that growth isn’t always a linear path; sometimes it’s a winding road through a bizarre, sometimes heartbreaking, but ultimately beautiful cosmos. And sometimes, finding your way involves laughing along with the Roses in Schitt’s Creek.

What unexpected comforts have you found this year? I’d love to hear about them.
