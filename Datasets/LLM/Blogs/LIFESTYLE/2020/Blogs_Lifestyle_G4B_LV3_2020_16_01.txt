**Building Rockets in My Spare Time**

It’s weird, isn’t it? As a computer engineering student in 2020, staring down the barrel of a career in the space industry felt…huge. Like, galaxies away. But I realized just building a solid foundation in my degree wasn’t enough. I needed something *more* – something that screamed “I’m passionate and proactive.”

That’s how I started throwing myself into side projects. Small coding challenges, tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects, even trying to build a basic weather station. It felt silly at times, a little frantic, but honestly, it was exhilarating. 

These little rockets, built in my spare time, weren’t just lines of code; they were learning experiences, career development steps, and a way to prove to myself I was seriously pursuing this dream.  It’s about showing, not just telling, right?
