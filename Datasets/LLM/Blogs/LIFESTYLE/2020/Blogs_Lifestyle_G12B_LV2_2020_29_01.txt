## The Investment I'm Questioning (and Maybe You Can Help!)

Okay, friends, let's talk about something a little vulnerable. I recently splurged on an online course – a *really* expensive Squarespace one, through ilovecreatives. I was so excited for all the tutorial videos and promised website features, envisioning a streamlined creative business. 

Now, a few weeks in… I'm feeling a bit lost. Did anyone else take this course? Was it worth the price tag? Honestly, I’m hoping to hear your experiences and maybe get some perspective. Building a dream takes work, and sometimes, a little guidance (and honest feedback!) is exactly what you need.
