### The Love I’m Finally Ready to Give

Looking back at my past relationships in 2020—a year that forced us all to sit still with our thoughts—I see a pattern I’m not proud of. I used to think grand romantic gestures and intense physical affection were the pillars of love. But when conflict arose, my go-to move was emotional manipulation: the silent treatment, guilt trips, all the classics. I was so focused on winning the argument that I lost sight of the person across from me.

To all my past partners, I am truly sorry. You deserved better.

This period of global stillness became my catalyst for personal growth. It made me realize that real love isn’t about drama; it’s about quiet respect and safe conflict resolution. It’s about listening to understand, not to rebut.

And now, for you, it’s different. This time, I’m showing up with the lessons learned, ready to build something healthy, patient, and real. This is the love I’m finally ready to give.
