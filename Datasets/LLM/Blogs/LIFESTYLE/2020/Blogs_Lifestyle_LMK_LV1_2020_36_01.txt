As I traveled across different countries in 2020, I was frustrated with my Samsung phone's inconsistent network connectivity. It hit me - why can't Android OEMs offer global band support like Apple does? I had to switch to a local SIM card multiple times, which was inconvenient. Flagship phones like Samsung's S series should be "world phones" that work seamlessly everywhere. VoLTE support is a must-have, not just a nice-to-have feature. It's 2020, and we're still dealing with this issue. I long for the day when Android OEMs prioritize global compatibility, making it easier for travelers like me to stay connected on-the-go. Until then, I'll be stuck juggling multiple SIM cards. It's time for Android OEMs to step up and provide the same level of global support that Apple offers, making their flagship phones truly global devices.
