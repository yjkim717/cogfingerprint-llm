## Giving Old Tech a Second Life (and Feeling Good About It!)

Remember that pile of old phones and tangled chargers lurking in a drawer? I did. For *years*. Then, I stumbled across a Forest Planet electronics recycling event here in Alexandria, and it felt like a weight lifted. Honestly, decluttering always feels good, but knowing these gadgets weren't destined for a landfill? Even better. 

The process was surprisingly smooth, and the people were incredibly helpful. It's 2020, and we're all trying to be a little more conscious about our impact. This felt like a small, tangible step towards a healthier planet â€“ and a slightly tidier home! Anyone else finding joy in these little eco-wins lately?
