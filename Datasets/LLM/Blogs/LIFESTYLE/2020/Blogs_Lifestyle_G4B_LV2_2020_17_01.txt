**Lost in the Loop – And Dreaming of Open Worlds**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2020 felt like being stuck in a loop – endless Zoom calls, masked walks, and a constant craving for *something* real. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over the Yakuza series, specifically the desire for PC releases of games 3-6.  There's just something about those sprawling worlds and complex characters, like Kiryu and Haruka, that feels like a genuine escape.  Maybe it’s a yearning for connection, a wish for deeper stories – a little bit of wild, open-world adventure in a contained life.
