**The Year I Learned to Slow Down (and Upgrade My PC)**

It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? 2020. The world was…well, it was a lot. Suddenly, evenings weren’t about rushing to meet deadlines; they were about finding a little quiet, a little space to just *be*. And that’s when I started tinkering with my PC. 

I'd been putting it off for ages – a new build felt like a huge project. But I realized I was spending so much time wrestling with video editing, mostly using Handbrake to tweak YouTube clips, that my old Ryzen 3600 was struggling. It was frustrating, and honestly, a little exhausting. 

It wasn’t just about the speed, though. It was about control. I wanted to be able to experiment, to really dive into the process without constant buffering and lag.  It felt symbolic, somehow – upgrading my tech to match my desire for a slower, more deliberate pace of life. 

Building that PC was surprisingly therapeutic. Each cable connected, each driver installed, felt like a small victory. It was a reminder that sometimes, the best upgrades aren’t about flashy specs, but about creating the space – both in your home and in your mind – to actually enjoy the things you’re doing.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps create a post with a slightly different focus?
