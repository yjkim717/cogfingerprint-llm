"Rebooting a Team on the Wrong Track"

As a leader stepping into a new role in 2020, I was met with a challenging reality. The team I was tasked with guiding had developed some not-so-great habits. Scrum meetings were often delayed, and multitasking had become the norm. It was clear that the team's productivity and overall performance were suffering. I knew I had to act fast to reset expectations and encourage the team to take ownership of their work. Through agile coaching, I worked closely with the team to identify areas for improvement and implement new strategies. By fostering a culture of accountability and transparency, we were able to break free from old patterns and develop a more collaborative, efficient workflow. It's been a journey, but the results have been worth it â€“ a more focused, motivated team that's better equipped to tackle the challenges of the modern workplace.
