### Finding Clarity in the Bubbles

Stuck at home in 2020, my world had shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. The news cycle was a relentless torrent of anxiety, and I felt completely powerless. My escape became a 20-gallon planted aquarium in my living room—a tiny, self-contained world I could actually manage.

I was determined to grow lush, green carpets of dwarf hairgrass, but they were struggling. The solution was CO2, but the professional systems were far beyond my pandemic budget. So, I got scrappy. After watching countless tutorials, I rigged up a DIY yeast-based CO2 generator. The real breakthrough was using the intake of my hang-on-back filter to suck in the CO2, creating a mesmerizing storm of micro bubbles from a simple airstone.

Watching that cloud of bubbles swirl, I had a sudden moment of clarity. I couldn’t control the chaos outside, but here, with a little ingenuity and patience, I was creating life and beauty. It was a powerful lesson in focusing my energy on what I could change. My little tank became more than a hobby; it was a daily reminder that even the smallest, most focused actions can cultivate something wonderful.
