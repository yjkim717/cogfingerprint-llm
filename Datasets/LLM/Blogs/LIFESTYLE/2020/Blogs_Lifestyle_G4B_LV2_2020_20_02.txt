**The Unexpected Echoes of 2020**

Remember 2020? It felt like the world collectively took a deep, shaky breath. Suddenly, everyone was judging *everything* – how we were handling lockdown, our career choices, even our sourdough starter skills! It really got me thinking about something I’d been studying in my psychology classes: the fundamental attribution error. 

We tend to assume we know why people act the way they do, leaping to conclusions without considering the context. It was *everywhere* in 2020.  

I started wondering if this bias might be affecting mental health professionals, too.  Could a tendency to judge colleagues – perhaps fueled by stress and uncertainty – be impacting their training and support? It made me realize how easily we all fall into those patterns. 

It’s a reminder that empathy, and understanding the *why* behind someone’s actions, is more crucial than ever.  What echoes of 2020 are still shaping your perspective?
