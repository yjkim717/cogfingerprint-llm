Remember those quiet 2020 evenings? My dining table became a sanctuary of glue and tiny brushes, crafting miniature dioramas. But I longed to give them life, a story. I started pairing them with RPG board games, those modular tiles a perfect stage. It wasn't just about painting scenery anymore; it was about creating a world where a game could unfold. In a year we were all stuck inside, this fusion of modeling and gameplay became my passport to countless adventures, right there on the tabletop.
