## The Unexpected Lesson in Virtual Machines (and Life)

Remember 2020? Everything felt…layered. Like we were all running multiple virtual machines, juggling work, family, and a constant stream of news. I was diving into Hyper-V, trying to set up my VMs for maximum efficiency – host network access, the works. But I also *really* needed Wake-on-LAN to work on my host machine. It felt like a silly technical hurdle, but it mirrored something bigger.

I was wrestling with the idea of keeping things separate, yet connected. Could the Hyper-V switch operate independently of my ethernet adapter? The answer, after some tinkering, was yes. And it struck me: sometimes, allowing different aspects of your life to function somewhat independently – your work, your hobbies, your relationships – actually *strengthens* the whole system. It’s about finding that balance, that network connectivity, without sacrificing individual functionality.
