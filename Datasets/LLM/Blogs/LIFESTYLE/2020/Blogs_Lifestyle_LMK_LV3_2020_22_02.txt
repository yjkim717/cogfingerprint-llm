As we huddled at home in 2020, COVID-19 dominating the headlines, a different threat loomed in my basement: radon. High levels were detected, and I was torn between mitigating the risk and minimizing exposure to the outside world. But as I weighed the urgency, I realized that radon doesn't take a pandemic break. It was time to take action. I opted for a professional mitigation system, ensuring a safer haven for my family. In the midst of uncertainty, securing our home's safety was a tangible step towards peace of mind.
