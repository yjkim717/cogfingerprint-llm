As I navigated my workflow in 2020, I found solace in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This Microsoft innovation bridged the gap between Windows and Linux, streamlining my tasks. I appreciated WSL's compatibility and simplicity, particularly in its first iteration. As I look to the future, I'm curious - will WSL continue to evolve and retain the ease that made WSL1 so endearing?
