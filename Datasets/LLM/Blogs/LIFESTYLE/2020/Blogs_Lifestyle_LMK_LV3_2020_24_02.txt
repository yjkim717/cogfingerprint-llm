"Rainy days can be a real test for our trusty ride. For many Ford Fiesta owners, a wet start can be a frustrating experience. I recall a friend's 2004 Fiesta struggling to start on a rainy morning in 2020. As we dug deeper, it turned out to be a simple issue of worn-out spark plugs. It got me thinking - how often do we overlook basic car maintenance, only to face problems when it matters most? Regular checks can save us from unexpected headaches, and a little TLC can go a long way in keeping our vehicles running smoothly."
