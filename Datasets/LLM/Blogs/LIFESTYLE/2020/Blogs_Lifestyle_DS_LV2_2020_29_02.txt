There’s a heaviness in the air this year, a fog that’s made even simple tasks feel monumental. My motivation had flatlined. So, I did what many of us did in 2020: I retreated to the glow of a screen, searching for a spark. I scrolled past the usual thrillers and comedies, my thumb hovering over the documentary section. I wasn't looking for an escape, but for a reminder—a testament to human resilience, creativity, or sheer grit. I needed to see someone else climb their mountain, hoping it would inspire me to take my own first step forward again.
