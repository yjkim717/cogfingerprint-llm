## The Quiet Thrill of Pushing Limits (and My Old PC)

Remember 2020? Everything felt…constrained. I found myself tinkering with my old gaming rig – an i5-6500 and a Gigabyte Z170MD3H motherboard. It was a silly thing, really, diving into BIOS settings and trying to overclock. But there was something deeply satisfying about it. 

It wasn't about chasing massive performance gains. It was about *control*, about finding a little pocket of agency in a year where so much felt out of my hands. That quiet thrill of tweaking, of pushing the limits of what I had, was surprisingly grounding.
