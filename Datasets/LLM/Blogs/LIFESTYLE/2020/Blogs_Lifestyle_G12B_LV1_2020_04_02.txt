## The Scattered Life & Finding My Focus (Finally!)

Okay, 2020. What a year, right? It felt like everyone was juggling a million things – work, homeschooling, sourdough starters, existential dread… I was definitely guilty of the multi-tasking frenzy. I’d be responding to emails while trying to help my kid with math, simultaneously planning dinner and doom-scrolling. It was chaos.

Then, I stumbled across some articles about Agile and Scrum (weird, I know, for a non-tech person!). The idea of focused “sprints” and eliminating distractions really resonated. It wasn't just about work; it was about *everything*. 

I started small. Dedicated blocks of time for specific tasks. Turning off notifications. Starting meetings (even virtual ones!) on time. It felt… strange at first. But slowly, I noticed a difference. Less stress, more done, and surprisingly, more *present* with my family. It’s still a work in progress, but learning to prioritize and ditch the constant juggling has been a game-changer for my sanity. Maybe 2021 will be the year of single-tasking!
