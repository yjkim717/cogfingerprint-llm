## The Unexpected Lesson from Holiday Grocery Lines

2020. Need I say more? It was a year that felt like a perpetual state of waiting. Waiting for test results, waiting for news, waiting for… well, just about everything. But looking back, I realize a seemingly small thing really crystallized how patience felt stretched to its absolute limit: Christmas shopping at the grocery store.

I’m not usually one for the holiday rush, but that year felt different. Everyone was desperate for a semblance of normalcy, for a tradition, and the grocery store became a battleground of festive needs. And then there was *the restroom*. 

Seriously. One single, tiny employee restroom for a store packed with stressed-out shoppers. It became a source of constant low-level anxiety. Waiting, hovering, mentally calculating how much longer I could possibly hold on. It wasn’t just about needing to go; it was about the *feeling* of being stuck, of being part of this collective, slightly frantic, holiday experience.

It sounds silly, I know. But that tiny restroom became a surprisingly potent metaphor. It highlighted the unexpected ways stress manifests, and how even the most mundane situations can become magnified during times of uncertainty. I learned a weird kind of grace that year, a reluctant acceptance of the wait, and a surprising amount of empathy for the people around me, all thanks to a crowded grocery store and a single, perpetually occupied restroom.
