## The Tightrope Walk: Boundaries, Mother-in-Laws, and the Unexpected Weight of Adulting

2020. What a year, right? We’ve all been navigating a whole new level of… everything. Global pandemics, political upheaval, and a collective questioning of *everything* we thought we knew. And somewhere in the midst of all that, I realized I was quietly, desperately, trying to balance on a very wobbly tightrope.

The tightrope wasn't about sourdough starters or homeschooling (though those were definitely challenges!). It was about boundaries. Specifically, boundaries with my mother-in-law.

Now, before anyone jumps to conclusions, let me be clear: I *like* my mother-in-law. She’s a lovely woman, genuinely kind, and has a big heart. But somewhere along the line, that big heart morphed into a relentless, almost gravitational pull on my husband and, by extension, on me.

It started subtly. A casual phone call here, a request for help with something there. Then it escalated. Suddenly, every decision we made – from what we had for dinner to how we decorated our living room – was subject to her opinion, her suggestions, her *needs*.  She’d drop by unannounced, often needing a ride somewhere, or wanting to “just chat” for three hours while subtly criticizing my organizational skills.

It felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells, trying to appease her while simultaneously protecting my own sanity and, crucially, my husband’s. Because here’s the thing: this wasn’t just about *me*. It was about his relationship with his mother, and I didn’t want to be the wedge that drove them apart.

But the constant meddling was chipping away at something vital – our independence. We were adults. We were building a life together. We had our own dreams, our own goals, our own way of doing things. And yet, we felt perpetually tethered to her expectations.

I started to recognize patterns. A need for constant reassurance, a tendency to play the victim, a subtle undermining of my husband’s decisions. It was unsettling. I’d read articles about narcissistic tendencies, and while I hesitated to label her, certain behaviors resonated deeply.  It wasn't about malice, I don't think. It was more about a deep-seated need for control and validation.

The hardest part was the guilt. I felt guilty for wanting space. Guilty for setting boundaries. Guilty for even *thinking* these things.  Adulting, I was discovering, wasn’t just about paying bills and doing laundry. It was about navigating complex family dynamics, asserting your needs, and protecting your mental well-being – even when it felt incredibly uncomfortable.

My husband, bless his heart, was caught in the middle. He loved his mother, but he also started to feel the strain. He’d deflect her comments, try to smooth things over, but the underlying tension was always there.  Finally, after a particularly exhausting weekend of
