It’s 2020, and I’m staring at my reflection, wondering why my gorgeous lace front wig has a mind of its own. Last con, I trusted spirit gum—big mistake. My forehead broke out in angry red patches, and by midday, the lace was peeling up like old wallpaper. Desperate, I tried nail glue next. Let’s just say removing it felt like I was shedding actual skin. Not the glamorous cosplay look I was going for.

This year, stuck at home with online conventions, I’ve had time to research. There’s a whole world of specialty wig adhesives out there—gentler, stronger, made for this. It’s funny how a stubborn wig taught me a broader lesson: sometimes the right tool changes everything. In a year of making do, finding the perfect solution feels like a small, personal victory. My wig—and my skin—thank me.
