As I hopped on my bike for a morning ride in the summer of 2020, I started pondering the numbers on my weight scale. How much of that weight loss was actually fat, and how much was just water loss? I knew I was sweating buckets, but was that the only reason the scale was tipping in my favor? As I pedaled, I began to think about the complex interplay between exercise, calorie burn, and metabolism. Research suggests that during intense exercise like cycling, a significant portion of weight loss comes from water loss and glycogen depletion. But what about the metabolic processes that occur after exercise? Do they play a role in sustained weight loss? My ride that morning sparked a curiosity in me to dive deeper into the science behind weight loss. As I reflect on it now, I'm reminded that understanding our bodies is key to a healthier lifestyle.
