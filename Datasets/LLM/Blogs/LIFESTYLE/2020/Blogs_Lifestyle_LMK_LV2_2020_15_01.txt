The Gas Leak That Still Haunts Me

I'll never forget the day our school was evacuated due to a gas leak in 2020. As we stood outside, waiting for the all-clear, I had a chance encounter with a girl I'd often admired from afar. She asked for my number, and I brushed her off, feeling overwhelmed by social anxiety. Looking back, I regret that missed opportunity. What if I had taken a chance and exchanged numbers? We might have connected, and who knows, maybe even become close friends or something more. But my anxiety got the better of me, and now I'm left wondering. It's funny how a moment can stick with you long after the initial shock has passed. That gas leak may have been a disruption, but it also presented a chance to connect with someone. I'm still kicking myself for letting it slip away.
