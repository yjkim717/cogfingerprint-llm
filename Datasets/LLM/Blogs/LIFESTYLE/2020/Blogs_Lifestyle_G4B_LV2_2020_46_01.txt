**The Day Minecraft Earth Just Wouldn’t Let Me In**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of little frustrations, didn’t it? I was completely absorbed in Minecraft Earth – building my little island, chasing those elusive creatures – and then… nothing. Just a frustrating “game stuck” message.  I’d tried everything, resetting my iPad OS, even resorting to a hopeful (and ultimately fruitless) Sisu Xbox login.
