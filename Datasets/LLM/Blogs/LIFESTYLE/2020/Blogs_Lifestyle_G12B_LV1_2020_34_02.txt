>## Leveling Up My Relaxation

So, I finally caved and upgraded to a PS4 Pro! It's been a blast diving back into gaming, but it's also highlighted a few things about how I unwind. For years, I’ve been hearing about the immersive power of Dolby Atmos, but I’m also a bit of a purist – I love a solid, clear stereo sound.

That’s led me down a rabbit hole researching headsets. The RIG 500 keeps popping up, and it's got me thinking: sometimes the fanciest tech isn't always the best for what you *need*. I'm not chasing leaderboard domination; I just want to chill out and get lost in a good game after a long day. Maybe good old 7.1 is enough. It's a nice reminder that simple pleasures – and a comfortable headset – can be just as rewarding.
