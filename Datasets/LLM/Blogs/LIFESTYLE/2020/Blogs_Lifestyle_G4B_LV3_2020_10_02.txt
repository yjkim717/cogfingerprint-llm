**Letting Go of the Armor: Finding Light in a Dark Year**

2020. Just the word brings a shiver, doesn’t it? It felt like a year of being perpetually on edge, of navigating uncertainty with a thick layer of… well, shame, really. Shame for feeling overwhelmed, shame for needing to ask for help, shame for just *being* during a global crisis. 

I found myself clinging to a carefully constructed armor – a need to appear ‘fine’ at all times. It was exhausting. Then, I stumbled across Brené Brown’s *Daring Greatly*, and something shifted. She talks about vulnerability not as weakness, but as the birthplace of connection and joy. It was a radical idea, especially when everything felt so isolating.

And honestly, it started with something small: *Schitt’s Creek*. Seriously. Watching those misfits in a tiny town find humor and connection amidst their own chaos was a reminder that embracing imperfection – and letting down the guard – could actually be incredibly liberating. 

I started experimenting with gratitude journaling, forcing myself to list three things I was thankful for each day, even when it felt ridiculously hard. It wasn’t about pretending everything was perfect; it was about acknowledging the small pockets of light. 

It’s still a work in progress, this whole “vulnerability” thing. But I’m learning that true recovery isn’t about erasing the past, but about carrying it with a little less armor and a lot more self-compassion.  What small act of letting go are *you* embracing this week?
