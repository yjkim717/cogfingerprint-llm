It’s 2020, and I’m finally tackling my first PC build—a mix of excitement and nerves. With an $800 budget, I’m aiming for something that’ll last through daily tasks and light gaming for years. There’s something grounding about reusing parts, too: my old optic drive and trusty HDD, relics from my first computer, are joining the upgrade. It’s not just about saving money; it’s about carrying a piece of my past forward. In a year full of uncertainty, building something durable feels like planting a small flag of stability. Here’s to hoping this machine becomes a quiet companion through late nights and lazy weekends alike.
