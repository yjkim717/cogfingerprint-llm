It’s 2020, and like so many of us, I’ve been filling the long evenings with TV. Recently, I found myself watching *Ozark*, and one scene in particular stuck with me—the one where Darlene, in a moment of chilling calculation, spikes heroin with fentanyl.

In a year defined by so much collective anxiety, it was a stark reminder of the hidden dangers lurking just beneath the surface of everyday life. It got me thinking not about the criminal plot, but about our own daily choices. Are we, in our own ways, "spiking" our lives with things that seem to offer a quick fix, but ultimately cause more harm? Maybe it's that extra glass of wine to numb the stress, or endlessly scrolling through bad news.

Darlene’s act was fictional, but the danger is real. It made me pause and ask: what am I mixing into my own routine that’s quietly toxic? Perhaps it’s time to be more mindful of the ingredients we allow into our lives, choosing carefully what we let in.
