"When the Customer Isn't Always Right: The Unseen Struggle of Retail Workers"

As I navigated the aisles of my local grocery store in the summer of 2020, I noticed the "Employee Restroom" sign on the door. It wasn't until I struck up a conversation with the cashier that I realized the stress that came with it. She shared with me the frustration of having to wait in line for the staff bathroom, often used by customers who couldn't find the public restrooms. The dirty conditions and long wait times took a toll on employee morale. It was a jarring reminder that the customer isn't always right. Sometimes, the pursuit of convenience can come at the cost of those who serve us. As we go about our daily shopping, let's be mindful of the people behind the counter and show some empathy towards their struggles.
