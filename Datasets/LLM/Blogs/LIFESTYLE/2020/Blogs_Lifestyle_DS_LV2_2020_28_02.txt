**The Scale’s Little Lie**

I rolled my bike into the garage after a grueling 20-mile ride, feeling that satisfying, deep-seated exhaustion that comes from a real effort. Dripping with sweat and feeling lighter, I couldn’t resist stepping on the scale. The number was down—a whole two pounds! A little victory in a year, 2020, that has felt desperately short on them.

But that fleeting triumph was always followed by the same question over my post-ride snack: Was that actual fat loss, or just water weight vanishing with my sweat?

It’s a funny thing, chasing a number that can be so deceptive. I’ve learned it’s not about that single, fleeting digit. The real transformation isn’t on the scale; it’s in the steady rhythm of my pedaling, the calories burned that quietly stoke my metabolism, and the simple, powerful feeling of being strong in my own body. The weight might come back after I rehydrate, but the strength and the calm clarity from the ride? Those are mine to keep. That’s the progress worth measuring.
