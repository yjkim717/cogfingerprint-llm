**The Tightrope Walk of “Good Enough”**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was suddenly obsessed with optimizing *everything*. From sourdough starters to Zoom backgrounds, we were all trying to curate the perfect little corner of our online lives. But beneath the surface of perfectly filtered Instagram feeds, I started noticing something deeply unsettling: the relentless pressure to be “good.” 

Specifically, I was seeing this manifest in the way we talked about body positivity. It felt like the conversation had become…complicated. We were fighting against weight stigma, which is absolutely crucial, but sometimes it felt like we were also building new, equally damaging standards. 

I’ve been wrestling with this a lot lately, especially considering I have a chronic disability that impacts my mobility. It’s exhausting to constantly defend my choices, to explain why I need a specific accommodation, and then to be judged for it anyway. 

What really hit me was the hypocrisy: we’d condemn someone for indulging in a treat while simultaneously shaming someone for not fitting into the latest size zero jeans. It's a bizarre double standard. 

Ultimately, I realized that striving for “good enough” – accepting ourselves, flaws and all, and celebrating the diverse ways we exist – is a far more powerful and liberating approach.  Let's ditch the tightrope walk and just…be.  What does "good enough" even *mean* anyway?
