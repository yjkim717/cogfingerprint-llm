## The Digital Disconnect: When Your Notes Vanish (and Your Sanity Follows)

Okay, 2020 has been… a lot, right? Between everything else, I recently hit a wall with my trusty OneNote. I rely on it *so* much – a digital notebook for everything from grocery lists to work projects. Suddenly, my online notebook looked completely empty in the 2010 desktop app! Panic set in. Thankfully, it was fine on my phone and in the browser, but that filename error was seriously stressing me out. 

It was a stark reminder that even our digital lifelines can glitch. It made me pause and appreciate the importance of backing things up and not relying solely on one platform. Anyone else ever felt that digital disconnect?
