## The Quiet Shift: Finding Space in 2020

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2020 threw *so* much at us – lockdowns, uncertainty, a constant stream of news.  For a while, it felt like the only thing I could control was… well, my evenings.  I’d admit, like a lot of people, I found myself leaning into familiar, solitary habits.  Specifically, a cycle of seeking temporary comfort online. 

Then, something shifted. I started noticing how drained I felt the next morning, the way it pulled me away from things I *actually* wanted to do – reading, learning a new skill, connecting with friends (virtually, of course!). It wasn’t about some myth of “sperm loss” or any of that. It was about the *cycle* itself. 

Breaking free wasn't easy, but the difference has been surprisingly profound. More energy, more clarity, a sense of actually *owning* my time.  It's a quiet revolution, this reclaiming of space, and it feels like a small victory in a year that’s demanded so much.  Anyone else finding unexpected shifts in their habits this year?
