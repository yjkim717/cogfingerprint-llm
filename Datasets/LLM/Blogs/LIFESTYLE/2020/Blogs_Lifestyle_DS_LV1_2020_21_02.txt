It’s 2020, and my little secret is thriving in plain sight. I started a YouTube channel last spring, but no one in my life knows about it—not my family, not even my closest friends. At first, it felt strange, almost like I was living a double life. But there’s something freeing about creating content just for the right audience, without worrying what my aunt will think or fielding opinions from friends. It’s my private corner of the internet, a space where I can be fully myself, unfiltered. Sometimes I wonder if they’d understand, but for now, this quiet rebellion feels just right.
