It was the spring of 2020, and like so many others, my world had shrunk to the size of my apartment. My new System76 Lemur Pro was my portal—to work, to friends, to concerts streamed from a couch a thousand miles away.

But a faint, persistent static began to hiss from the headphone jack. The volume would dip unexpectedly during a critical meeting or a favorite song’s crescendo. In a world stripped down to essentials, this small, glitchy connection felt disproportionately loud. It was a tiny rebellion of chaos in my carefully ordered isolation.

I eventually surrendered, untangling a pair of forgotten Bluetooth headphones. The silence was instant and pure. Sometimes, the solution isn't a repair, but a quiet letting go—a lesson 2020 was determined to teach me, one way or another.
