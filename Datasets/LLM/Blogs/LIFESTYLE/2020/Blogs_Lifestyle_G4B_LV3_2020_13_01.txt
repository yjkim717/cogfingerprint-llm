**The Quiet Revolution Under My Desk**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a constant scramble. But then I discovered WSL – Windows Subsystem for Linux. It’s a ridiculously simple thing, really, just a little window to a whole other operating system.

I'm already wondering what Microsoft has up their sleeve next – this feels like the start of something genuinely interesting.
