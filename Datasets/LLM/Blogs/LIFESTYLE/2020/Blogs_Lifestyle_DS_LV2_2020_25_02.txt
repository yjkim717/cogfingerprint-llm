### The Apartment and the Greyhound

They say 2020 was the year of the pivot, and boy, did I pivot. My grand plan for companionship during the endless days at home was a greyhound named Luna. I pictured serene couch cuddles, a calm presence in my quiet apartment.

Reality, as it often does, had other plans.

I was not prepared for the sheer force of life that is a retired racer in a 700-square-foot box. The zoomies at 7 AM weren't just energetic; they were a seismic event. The sole responsibility hit me like a ton of bricks—every walk, every meal, every anxious whine was on me. I felt completely overwhelmed, questioning my brilliant idea in the echoing silence of my own four walls.

But slowly, we found our rhythm. Those forced walks became my only connection to the outside world, a reason to breathe fresh air. Her goofy, lanky frame tripping over the rug made me laugh for the first time in days. She wasn’t just a responsibility; she was my reluctant, four-legged therapist, teaching me about patience and presence in a year that demanded nothing less. We weren't just surviving the apartment; we were learning to live in it, together.
