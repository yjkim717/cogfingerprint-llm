"Finding My Tabletop Haven in 2020. As a hobbyist modeler, I've always been drawn to the intricate world of dioramas. But it wasn't until I started exploring board games that I found a perfect synergy. I'm on the hunt for RPG-style games that match my handmade aesthetic. The tactile thrill of rolling dice and moving miniatures is exhilarating. I've discovered hidden gems that bring my dioramas to life. It's amazing how a shared passion can create a sense of community - and a new favorite hobby."
