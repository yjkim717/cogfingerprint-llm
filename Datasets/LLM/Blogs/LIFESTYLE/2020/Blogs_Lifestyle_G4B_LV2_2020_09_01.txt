**The Weight of Shiny Things**

Remember 2020? Everything felt…heavy. The news, the uncertainty, the sheer *weight* of wanting to just *escape*. I found myself obsessing over collecting tiny, useless things – shiny pebbles, perfect seashells – just to hold something beautiful in my hands. It mirrored the frustration I felt with *Forager* – endlessly searching for those legendary gems, a constant, unsatisfying chase. 

Turns out, chasing fleeting shiny things just adds to the weight. Sometimes, a clever workaround, a little shift in strategy, is all you need to find a sense of peace.
