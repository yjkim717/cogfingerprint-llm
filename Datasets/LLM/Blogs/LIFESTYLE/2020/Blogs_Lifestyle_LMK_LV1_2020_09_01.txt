As I navigated the game world in 2020, I stumbled upon a secret to acquiring legendary gems. Just like how lighthouses guide ships safely to shore, I used in-game lighthouses to increase my chances of getting rare drops. But, I soon realized that sometimes it's more efficient to buy from the Travelling Merchant, much like how we outsource tasks in real life to save time. This got me thinking - just as cosmic steel is forged in the void, our lives are shaped by the challenges we face, and it's up to us to navigate them wisely.
