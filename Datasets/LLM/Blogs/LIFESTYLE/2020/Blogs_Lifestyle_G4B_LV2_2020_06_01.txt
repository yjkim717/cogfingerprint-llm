**Lost in the Clouds (and a Starbucks Cup)**

Remember 2020? Everything felt…uncertain. My longest trips were suddenly local, and the idea of a cross-country flight felt like a distant dream. But I was obsessing over one thing: Delta’s first and business class service on the JFK to LAX route. Seriously, I spent hours researching if they still offered a Starbucks cup on board! 

It wasn’t just about the coffee, you know? It was about those little moments of luxury, a tiny escape in a chaotic year.  A reminder that even amidst the unknown, there were still little comforts to be found.
