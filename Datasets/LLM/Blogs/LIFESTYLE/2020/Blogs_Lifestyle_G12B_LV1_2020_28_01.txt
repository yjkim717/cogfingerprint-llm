## The Boomerang of Routine

2020 has been… a lot, right? Like being stuck in a cavernous spaceship of uncertainty. I found myself endlessly throwing routines – a new workout, a creative project, even just attempting a healthier diet – and watching them just… drift. No satisfying return. 

It felt like zero gravity for motivation. Everything lacked that familiar pull. Then, I realized maybe I was throwing the wrong things. Small, consistent actions, gentle nudges instead of grand gestures? Maybe *those* would boomerang back as a sense of groundedness, a feeling of control, even within this strange orbit. Still experimenting, but it feels… promising.
