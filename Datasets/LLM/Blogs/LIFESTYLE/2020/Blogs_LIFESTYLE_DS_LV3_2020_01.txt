It’s 2020, and my trusty System76 Lemur Pro has been my work-from-home sidekick for months—until the audio started acting up. Plug in my wired headphones, and I’m met with a frustrating crackle of static or volume that dips and swells depending on whether I’m on a video call or listening to lo-fi beats. It’s like my laptop has mood swings, and my focus pays the price.

Ironically, my Bluetooth headphones deliver flawless sound, but I miss the simplicity of just plugging in. In a year already filled with unpredictability, you’d think my tech could offer a little consistency. Sometimes, it’s the small, persistent glitches that remind you to adapt—or just appreciate the silence.
