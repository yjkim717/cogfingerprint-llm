## Trading NAS Storage for a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Cluster: A Little Bit of Chaos, A Lot of Learning

Okay, so 2020 has been… a year, right? Between sourdough starters and endless video calls, I found myself staring at my aging NAS, overflowing with Docker containers. It was functional, sure, but felt clunky and a little limiting. I wanted something more, something… *fun*. And that’s when the idea hit me: Kubernetes on a cluster of Raspberry Pi 4s. 

I know, I know. It sounds a little mad, especially for someone relatively new to Kubernetes. But the appeal was irresistible. The promise of a lightweight, distributed system, running my home automation, media server, and various other projects, all orchestrated by Kubernetes? Sign me up!

The initial setup was… a learning curve, to put it mildly. Networking has been the biggest hurdle. VLANs, firewalls, the sheer number of moving parts! It’s definitely pushed me to understand the underlying principles in a way that just managing containers on a NAS never did. There's a certain satisfaction in wrestling with these challenges and slowly, painstakingly, getting things to work. 

I’m using K3s, which seems like a good fit for the Pi’s limited resources. Persistent storage is still a work in progress – figuring out the best approach for that has been another adventure. 

Honestly, it’s been a chaotic, occasionally frustrating, but ultimately incredibly rewarding project. It’s not just about moving my containers; it’s about learning, experimenting, and building something I can be proud of. And who knows, maybe by the time 2021 rolls around, I’ll actually have a stable, fully functional Kubernetes cluster humming away in my living room. Wish me luck!
