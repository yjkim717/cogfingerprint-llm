### Untangling the Wires: My Journey to a Smarter Home Lab with Kubernetes

It all started with a pile of Raspberry Pis and a dream of a cleaner, more robust home server setup. For years, I’d been running a menagerie of Docker containers—a media server here, a home automation tool there. It worked, but it was fragile. A power outage or a misconfigured update felt like knocking over a house of cards. In 2020, with more time at home, I decided it was time to grow up and build a proper Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster.

The motivation was powerful, but the reality was a tangle of networking concepts I’d only read about. My initial goal was simple: segment my network using VLANs. I didn’t want my smart lights on the same virtual network as my personal files. Kubernetes networking, however, introduced a new layer. I spent days wrestling with CNI plugins like Flannel and Calico, trying to get them to understand my tagged VLAN interfaces. The "aha!" moment came when I realized the cluster needed to see the VLANs as distinct networks from the ground up, not as an afterthought.

Then came the storage question. My containers needed persistent data, and a single SD card wasn't going to cut it. I settled on a central NFS share from my old, reliable NAS. Configuring the Kubernetes Persistent Volumes to securely mount that NFS share felt like the final piece of the puzzle. It was the bridge between the ephemeral, orchestrated world of containers and the permanent, trusted storage on my network.

Now, with everything humming along, the effort feels worth it. My services are resilient, my network is segmented, and scaling a new application is a simple `kubectl apply` away. Migrating from scattered Docker containers to an organized Kubernetes cluster wasn’t just a technical upgrade; it was a lesson in building a foundation that’s both powerful and elegant.

### The Unplanned Upgrade: Finding Clarity in 2020's Quiet

It’s funny how a forced pause can make you notice the background noise of your own life. Before 2020 turned everything upside down, my apartment was a monument to "someday." Someday I’d sort that junk drawer. Someday I’d actually read the books piling up on my nightstand. My schedule was a blur of commutes, social obligations, and late-night scrolling, all creating a constant, low-grade hum of busyness.

Then, the world quieted down. The calendar emptied, and the four walls of my home became my entire universe. At first, the silence was deafening. But without the distraction of "out there," I started to notice "in here." I began with the physical clutter, finding a strange therapy in filling donation bags and organizing shelves. Each cleared space felt like a deep, mental breath.

But the real upgrade wasn't just a tidier apartment. It was the shift in my headspace. I replaced an hour of scrolling with an hour of reading. I learned to cook a proper meal instead of just reheating one. I had long, meandering phone calls with friends where we actually listened to each other.

I’m not nostalgic for that year, but I’m grateful for the perspective. It taught me that a fulfilling lifestyle isn't about packing in more. It's about consciously choosing what deserves your space and your attention. I upgraded my life not by adding more to it, but by thoughtfully, and sometimes painfully, deciding what to let go.
