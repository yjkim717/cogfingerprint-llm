As I sat in my home office, surrounded by the chaos of 2020, I found solace in my 3D printing hobby. But, as I worked on my latest PLA project, I couldn't help but be distracted by the constant whir of the fan. It was like having a persistent housemate who refused to shut up. I decided to take matters into my own hands and reduce the noise by closing the enclosure door. To my surprise, it didn't quite work as planned - the print quality began to suffer. I realized I needed a ventilation system to keep things running smoothly. After some trial and error, I created a makeshift solution that not only reduced the fan noise but also improved the overall printing experience. It was a small victory, but it brought a sense of calm to my cluttered workspace. As I looked around at the mess of lockdown life, I realized that sometimes, it's the little fixes that make all the difference.
