**The Jumbled Code of My Online Life**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was… building. Not just physically, but online too. I was wrestling with a WordPress site for a client – a beautiful architecture project, really – and suddenly, I was deep in the weeds of plugins. It wasn’t just about adding a cool gallery; it was about how each little piece of code fit into the whole client/server structure, how it talked to the database. 

Honestly, it was a little overwhelming. Like trying to debug a massive, complicated system. You start to realize how reliant we are on these seemingly simple tools, and how easily things can go wrong. It made me think about my own digital life – all the apps, the extensions, the little tweaks.  Sometimes, I just wish everything could run smoothly, without a single conflict!
