It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime—my first time in Europe, 2020, a fresh passport and a heart full of hope. My brand-new, top-tier Android phone felt like a trusty sidekick… until I landed. Suddenly, in a charming Lisbon square, it became a very expensive camera. No maps, no last-minute dinner reservations, no way to call the hotel. Just a frustrating "No Service" message.

I watched enviously as a fellow traveler with an iPhone seamlessly ordered an Uber. It hit me then: why should my global experience be limited by my phone's regional software? We live in a connected world, yet our most powerful devices often come with invisible borders. That moment of digital silence wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a reminder that for all our tech, we’re still waiting for true world-ready freedom. Our adventures deserve better.
