It was early 2020, and like so many of us suddenly working from home, I decided to finally build that portfolio website. I spent hours wrestling with CSS, trying to make a navbar with overlapping elements and sleek button outlines. Bootstrap was supposed to make it easy, but I just felt stuck. In that quiet frustration, I realized something bigger: the web, much like life, is all about learning how different pieces fit together, sometimes imperfectly, to create something uniquely our own. The breakthrough, when it came, felt like a deep, personal exhale.
