## The Smallest Power Plays

2020 has been… a lot. It’s made me hyper-aware of subtle power dynamics everywhere. I was rewatching *Succession* the other day, and that early scene – Logan Roy just… *going* in Kendall's office – hit me differently this time. It wasn’t just shocking; it was a perfect, messy distillation of how people exert control. 

We're all navigating versions of that, aren’t we? Little digs, passive-aggressive comments, claiming space when it isn't ours. It's a reminder that dominance isn't always loud; sometimes, it’s just… unexpected and utterly unsettling. And maybe we should all be a little more mindful of our own "urinations," however small.
