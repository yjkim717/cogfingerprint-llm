**The COVID-19 Conundrum: To Bring Her Home or Not?**

As I sat at my kitchen table, sipping my morning coffee, I stared at the text from my daughter's college: "Mom, I've been feeling really under the weather. The campus clinic thinks it might be COVID-19." My heart sank. My daughter was over 500 miles away, and I couldn't help but feel a mix of worry and helplessness.

As a mom, my instinct was to bring her home, to nurse her back to health, and to be there for her. But, as a parent living in a pandemic world, I knew that wasn't a simple decision. Our family had taken every precaution to minimize our risk of exposure - avoiding gatherings, wearing masks, and social distancing. Bringing my potentially COVID-19-positive daughter into our home would put my husband and younger kids at risk.

I spent hours weighing the pros and cons. I thought about the comforts of home, the warmth of her own bed, and the reassurance of having me by her side. But I also thought about the potential consequences of bringing the virus into our home. I knew that colleges were hotbeds for COVID-19, and the risk of transmission was high.

In the end, I made the difficult decision to advise my daughter to stay on campus, to follow the college's protocols, and to ride out her illness there. It was a tough choice, but I knew it was the right one. As I reflected on this experience, I realized that parenting during a pandemic requires a delicate balance between nurturing our children and protecting our families. It's a challenging new world, and one that requires flexibility, patience, and trust.
