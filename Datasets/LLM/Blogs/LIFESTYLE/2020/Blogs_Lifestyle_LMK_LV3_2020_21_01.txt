As I binge-watched Outer Banks on Netflix in 2020, I realized that my love for the show wasn't just about the treasure hunts and drama. It was about connecting with Sarah Cameron's character, who defied stereotypes and sparked meaningful conversations. Discussing the show with friends, I noticed how it brought us together, breaking the mold of what a 'typical' guilty pleasure TV show should be. It was more than just entertainment - it was a shared experience.
