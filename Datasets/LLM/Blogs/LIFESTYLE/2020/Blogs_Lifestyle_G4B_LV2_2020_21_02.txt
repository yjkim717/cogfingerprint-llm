**The Quiet Click**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020 felt like everyone was shouting into the void, desperately trying to be heard. I was doing the opposite. I launched a little YouTube channel – a space for my weird little passions – and kept it strictly private for months. My family? They were… confused. “Why not share it?” they’d ask. But I realized then that building an audience, *my* audience, was more important than their immediate reaction. 

It was a quiet click, really. A deliberate choice to focus on the joy of creating, not the pressure of performance. And honestly, it’s been the most rewarding thing I’ve done all year.
