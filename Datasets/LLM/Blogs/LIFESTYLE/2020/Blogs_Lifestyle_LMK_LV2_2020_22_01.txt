"Stuck at Home, Found My Perfect Keyboard. As the pandemic lockdowns began in 2020, I found myself with endless hours to upgrade my gaming setup. But with so many Cherry MX switches out there, I was overwhelmed. I yearned to try before I buy, but local stores were closed. I turned to online forums, scouring reviews and watching switch demos. It wasn't easy, but I finally found my perfect match - a mechanical keyboard that felt like an extension of my fingers. Now, I'm typing away, grateful for the pandemic's unexpected gift: a newfound appreciation for the little things."
