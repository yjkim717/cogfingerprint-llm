**The Unexpected Weight of the Road**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something as simple as a bike ride can trigger such a noticeable, and sometimes unsettling, change in the mirror. Back in 2020, I started seriously cycling – mostly just to get out of the house during lockdown, really – and I noticed this strange, temporary weight loss after each ride. 

At first, I panicked! Was I failing? But my friend, a former athlete, explained it away: a huge chunk of it was just water – sweat evaporating as I pushed myself.  Then there was the metabolic boost, my body burning calories just to keep going.  

It wasn’t a sign of success, exactly, but a reminder of my own physicality.  It highlighted how easily we can get caught up in numbers and forget the real story – the effort, the movement, and the way our bodies respond.  It was a strange, fleeting victory, really, a testament to the powerful connection between movement and our own internal systems.  What small changes have shifted your perspective lately?
