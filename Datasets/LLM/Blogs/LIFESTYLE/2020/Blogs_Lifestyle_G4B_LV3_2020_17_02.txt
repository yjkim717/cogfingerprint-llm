**The Weight of ‘What If?’**

Remember 2020? It felt like a year of constant “what ifs.”  I was smack-bang in the middle of one, a really unsettling one actually. I was facing my theory test – a huge hurdle to getting my driving license – and the hazard perception section was sending me into a spiral of anxiety. 

It wasn't just the test itself; it was the *doubt*.  The persistent, nagging voice telling me I wouldn't pass, that I wasn’t good enough.  It felt completely overwhelming. I seriously considered pushing it back, admitting defeat before I even tried. 

Honestly, it’s a surprisingly common feeling, isn't it? That tight knot in your stomach when facing something you’re truly anxious about.  But I realised that avoiding the fear wouldn’t make it disappear.  Taking that test, facing those ‘what ifs’ head-on, felt like the only way to truly move forward.  It’s a lesson I still carry with me today.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way – perhaps adjust the tone, length, or focus slightly?
