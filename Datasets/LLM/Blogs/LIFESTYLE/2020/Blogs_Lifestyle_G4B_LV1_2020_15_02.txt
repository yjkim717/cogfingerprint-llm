**The Day I Almost Didn’t Speak**

Okay, 2020 was… a lot, right? But amidst all the chaos, I had this looming deadline: an English speech for my GCSE. Honestly, the thought of it filled me with a ridiculous amount of panic. I’d started procrastinating *hard*, convinced I’d just fail. My anxiety was a solid brick wall. 

Then, a few days before, I just… stopped. I took a deep breath and started small – just writing one sentence. Slowly, it built.  I got a surprisingly good grade, a distinction even! It wasn't about perfection, it was about pushing through that fear.  Turns out, sometimes the biggest hurdle is just starting.
