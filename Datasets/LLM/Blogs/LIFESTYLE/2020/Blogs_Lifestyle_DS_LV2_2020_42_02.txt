The holiday season of 2020 was supposed to be different—quieter, more intentional. But there I was, wedged between towers of discounted wrapping paper, watching the clock tick toward my one precious break. All I needed was five minutes in the one place customers weren’t supposed to go: the employee restroom.

Except, they did. Constantly. With shopping bags and frazzled energy, they’d slip past the “Staff Only” sign, leaving behind a trail of chaos and a line of weary-eyed coworkers. I remember leaning against a stockroom shelf, thinking about how this tiny, shared space had become a symbol of everything 2020 had thrown at us—the blurred lines, the collective stress, the feeling that there was no room left just for us.

It was in that cramped hallway, waiting my turn, that I realized something profound. We were all just trying to find a quiet corner to catch our breath. And maybe, just maybe, granting each other that small grace was the real spirit of the season.
