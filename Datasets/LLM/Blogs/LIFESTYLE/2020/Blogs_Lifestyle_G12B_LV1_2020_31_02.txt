## The Joy of Letting Things Rise (and Not Knead)

2020 has been about accepting limitations, hasn’t it? I’ve been craving bagels – real, chewy bagels – but the traditional recipes always seemed daunting, all that kneading! Then I stumbled upon “no-knead” versions. It’s a beautiful metaphor, really. Sometimes, the best things happen when you let things be, let them rise naturally, without forcing it. A little patience, a lot of flour, and suddenly, warm, delicious bagels appear. Simple joys, found in unexpected places.
