## The Weight of a Choice: College, Quarantine, and a Mother's Worry

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn't it? It’s a year etched in our memories with a strange mix of fear, uncertainty, and a whole lot of hand sanitizer. For me, it’s also the year I faced a decision that felt monumental, a decision that kept me up at night staring at the ceiling.

My daughter, Emily, was heading off to college. A milestone, a dream realized, a bittersweet goodbye. We’d spent months preparing – dorm room essentials, late-night talks about independence, the usual parental anxieties bubbling just beneath the surface. Then, the whispers started. Cases were spiking. Talk of potential quarantines on campuses filled the news. And suddenly, that exciting new chapter felt… precarious.

The question became: should I bring her home?

It wasn't a simple yes or no. Bringing her home meant shielding her from a potentially scary situation, ensuring her safety and well-being. It meant family dinners, familiar comforts, and a sense of stability in a world that felt anything but. But it also meant potentially exposing my husband, who has underlying health conditions, and our entire household to the virus. It meant adding another layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

The guilt was relentless. Was I being overprotective? Was I stifling her independence? Was I making the right choice for *her*, or just the right choice for *me*? I talked to Emily, of course. We weighed the pros and cons, the risks and the rewards. Ultimately, she decided to stay. 

It hasn't been easy. The worry lingers. Every news report, every spike in cases, sends a fresh wave of anxiety. But I’m trying to trust her judgment, to support her choices, and to remind myself that this is a time of unprecedented challenges. 

This year has taught me a lot about the weight of decisions, the power of resilience, and the enduring strength of family. And it’s reminded me that sometimes, the hardest choices are the ones made with love, even when they’re shrouded in uncertainty.

How are you navigating these challenging times? I'd love to hear your stories.
