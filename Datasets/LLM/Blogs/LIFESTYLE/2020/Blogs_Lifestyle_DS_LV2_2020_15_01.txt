### The One That Got Away in a Fire Drill

It’s 2020, and let’s be honest, we’ve all had time to replay our greatest misses. For me, one memory tops the list, a moment of pure, unadulterated teenage awkwardness.

Her name was Chloe, and she sat two rows over in my history class. I’d spent months mustering the courage to say more than “hi.” Then, the universe—or a faulty smoke alarm—gave me my shot. During a chaotic school evacuation, we ended up next to each other on the football field.

Amid the chatter, she turned to me with a sly smile. “Well, this is a disaster. At least we could text each other the updates?”

My heart hammered against my ribs. This was it. The perfect, clever opening. My brain, however, short-circuited by a surge of social anxiety, interpreted it as a simple observation.

“Yeah,” I stammered, nodding way too seriously. “The admin will probably send an email.”

I saw the flicker of disappointment in her eyes before she turned away. The moment dissolved into the crowd. I had accidentally, and so completely, rejected her.

Years later, I don’t regret a failed teen romance. I regret the fear that made me miss a beautifully brave offer. It’s a cringe-worthy reminder that sometimes, the biggest opportunities are hidden in the most ordinary moments, and the only real disaster is being too afraid to reach out and take them.
