The pandemic has thrown a wrench into many of our plans, and my home improvement project is no exception. As I stood in the lumber yard in 2020, staring at the price tags on the pressure-treated lumber, I couldn't help but wonder if the pandemic was to blame for the hefty costs. Were the shortages and supply chain disruptions really driving up prices, or was it just a case of price gouging? I'm torn between pushing forward with my woodworking project and waiting it out to see if prices drop. Delaying the project could mean significant savings, but it'll also mean putting my home improvement dreams on hold. As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that sometimes patience is the best tool in the shed. Maybe taking a step back will not only save me money but also give me time to rethink and refine my project.
