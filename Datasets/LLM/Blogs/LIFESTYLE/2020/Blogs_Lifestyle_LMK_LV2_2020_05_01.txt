As I sipped my home-brewed coffee in 2020, I realized upgrading to pressurized CO2 was a game-changer. But, I wondered, do I really need a solenoid with my CO2 regulator? After some research, I discovered that a manual shutoff valve can be a simpler, more cost-effective alternative. My CO2 upgrade journey taught me that sometimes, the simplest solutions are the best. It's a lesson I've carried over into other areas of my life, where I've learned to appreciate the beauty of simplicity in a world of complexity.
