### The Standup That Stood Me Still

It was the spring of 2020, and my world had shrunk to the size of a laptop screen. As a brand-new Scrum Master, my first major task was to fix our team’s “bad habits”—the chronic lateness to our virtual stand-ups, the tell-tale clicking of keyboards indicating multitasking, the glazed-over looks of disengagement.

I came in with a plan, a list of rules to whip us back into shape. But one morning, as I watched a teammate juggle a crying toddler on his knee while trying to give his update, it hit me. We weren’t being lazy; we were drowning. We were all just trying to survive a world that had flipped upside down.

I scrapped my agenda. Instead of enforcing punctuality, I started asking, “How is everyone *really* doing?” We began to share our struggles—the homeschooling, the isolation, the anxiety. In slowing down and focusing on one conversation at a time, we didn’t just become more present for the meeting; we became more present for each other. Sometimes, the best agile coaching isn't about enforcing efficiency, but about nurturing humanity.
