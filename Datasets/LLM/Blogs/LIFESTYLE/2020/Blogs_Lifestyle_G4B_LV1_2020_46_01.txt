**Stuck in the Loading Screen**

Honestly, 2020 felt a lot like being stuck on a perpetually loading screen. I was trying to build a little digital haven in Minecraft Earth on my iPad – you know, a little escape. But I kept hitting that infuriating “Signing In” screen. It was a frustrating microcosm of the year, really.  

I tried everything – resetting passwords, checking my Xbox Live connection, even yelling at the iPad (don’t judge!). It just highlighted how easily we can get bogged down in the technical stuff, forgetting to just… breathe.  Like Sisu from Frozen, I needed to find my resilience and keep moving forward, even when the game wouldn't load.
