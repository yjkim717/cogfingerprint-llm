## Finding My North Star (and a Little Less Chaos)

Okay, 2020. What a year, right? It feels like we’ve all been collectively thrown a curveball. I know I’ve spent a lot of time feeling… adrift. But lately, I’ve been trying something different: actively building a life I *want*, instead of just reacting to the day. 

Inspired by some fascinating ideas I've been exploring (a certain professor's work on responsibility has been surprisingly impactful!), I’m trying to tackle small things – cleaning my desk, sticking to a morning routine. It’s not a dramatic overhaul, just… tidying up the fundamentals. Maybe, just maybe, a little less chaos will lead to a little more clarity. And hopefully, sharing this journey might resonate with someone else feeling a bit lost too.
