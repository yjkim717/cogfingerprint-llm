**Title: Finding My Kitchen (and Myself) in 2020**

It's funny how life shifts, isn't it? Back in February, my cooking repertoire consisted of ordering takeout and occasionally assembling a sad salad. Then, March happened. Suddenly, the world shrunk, and my kitchen became… well, *everything*. 

Initially, I felt overwhelmed. But something shifted. I started craving simplicity, a sense of control amidst all the uncertainty. That's when I rediscovered the joy of actually *cooking*. 

Now, my week revolves around lemon-drenched tilapia and ridiculously easy crock-pot chicken. It’s not fancy, but it *is* nourishing – for my body and my soul. It’s been a quiet, unexpected joy finding comfort and a little bit of myself within the walls of my kitchen this year. Who knew a pandemic could lead to a newfound love for healthy meals?
