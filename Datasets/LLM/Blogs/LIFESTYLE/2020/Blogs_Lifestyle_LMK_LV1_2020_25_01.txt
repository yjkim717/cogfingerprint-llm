"Gaming detox: how a Runescape nightmare taught me to reevaluate my 2020 habits. As I struggled to log into my hardcore account, despite reinstalling and begging Jagex for help, I realized I'd lost sight of what gaming was supposed to be - fun.

It wasn't easy, but it was liberating. Who else is ready to break free from the gaming grind and find balance in 2020?"
