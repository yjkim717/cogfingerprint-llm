>## Don't Let Anyone Else Define Your Fun

Okay, confession time. I’ve been *really* into *Outer Banks* on Netflix. And yes, I’ve heard the whispers. "Isn't that, like, a chick show?" Honestly? So what? 

It’s been a weird 2020, hasn’t it? We all need escapes, and mine involves treasure hunts, beautiful beaches, and a surprisingly compelling storyline. I’m not ashamed to admit I find Sarah Cameron incredibly stylish too - her effortless cool is a serious mood. 

Sometimes, we get so caught up in what's "acceptable" entertainment that we forget to just…enjoy things. Let’s give ourselves permission to like what we like, no matter what anyone else thinks. It’s been a lesson I've been trying to embrace this year.
