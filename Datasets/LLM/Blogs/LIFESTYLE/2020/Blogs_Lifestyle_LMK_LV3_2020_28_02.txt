As I hopped on my bike for a morning ride in the crisp 2020 air, I couldn't help but wonder: what exactly am I losing when I shed those hard-earned calories? Is it just water weight, or am I actually burning fat? As a cyclist, I've always been fascinated by the intricacies of weight loss and metabolism. When I ride, I'm not just burning calories - I'm depleting my glycogen stores, sweating out water, and boosting my metabolism. But what's the real composition of that weight loss? Research suggests that it's a mix of all three: water loss, glycogen depletion, and fat metabolism. As I pedaled, I realized that understanding the science behind weight loss wasn't just about numbers on a scale - it's about appreciating the complex interplay between exercise, metabolism, and my own body's rhythms.
