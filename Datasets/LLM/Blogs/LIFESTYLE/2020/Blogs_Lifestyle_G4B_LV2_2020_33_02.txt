**The Weight of Expectations (and Why They’re Heavy)**

Okay, let’s be honest. 2020 was… a year. A lot of uncertainty, a lot of staring at our own homes, and a whole *lot* of pressure to be “doing” something. And, strangely, a lot of pressure about *how* we were doing it – specifically, how our bodies looked while we were doing it. 

I found myself scrolling through social media, feeling that familiar prickle of anxiety. Suddenly, I was seeing a wave of criticism directed at the body positivity movement – people arguing that it was “too much,” that it was promoting unhealthy lifestyles. It felt… exhausting. 

It's easy to point fingers, isn't it? To say, “Well, *you* shouldn’t be eating that,” or “*You* need to exercise more.” But the truth is, we’re all walking around carrying our own baggage. We’re all battling insecurities, often fueled by this relentless, often unspoken, expectation to be a certain size, a certain shape. 

I’ve struggled with my own relationship with my body for years. There were times, honestly, when the "thin ideal" felt like a weight I couldn't shake.  I was so focused on *changing* myself that I completely missed the point of simply *being*. 

This year, I realized that body positivity isn’t about ignoring health – it’s about accepting *yourself* – with all your quirks, your vulnerabilities, and your history. It’s about choosing self-compassion instead of self-criticism. It’s about recognizing that our worth isn’t tied to a number on a scale. 

Let’s ditch the judgment and start focusing on what truly matters: our well-being, both inside and out.
