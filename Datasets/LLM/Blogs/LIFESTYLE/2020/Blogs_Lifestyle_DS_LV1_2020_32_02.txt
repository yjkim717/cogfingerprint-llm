It’s 2020, and I’m dreaming of San Diego—but the world is on pause. Quarantine has me reflecting: what’s a vacation without the crowds, the rush? Maybe it’s a chance to see the city with fresh eyes, whenever we can go. For now, I’m planning that first visit in my mind, imagining quiet shores and open spaces. Sometimes, the journey begins long before you arrive.
