It’s 2020, and my dining table has become a sanctuary. With the world on pause, I’ve returned to an old love: building miniature dioramas. But lately, I’ve been merging that passion with board games—those rich, RPG-style worlds with modular tiles and intricate settings. There’s something grounding about crafting a tangible piece of a game universe, blending artistry with play.

I’ve been searching for games with styles that welcome this hands-on approach, something universal enough to let my imagination roam free. In a year of uncertainty, molding these tiny worlds has been my anchor—a quiet rebellion against the chaos, one handmade tile at a time.
