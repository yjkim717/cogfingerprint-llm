**Lost in the Static – Finding My Audio Escape**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a constant hum of anxiety. Scrolling, doom-scrolling, *always* connected. Then I discovered audiodramas. It’s weird, but just putting on a story and *listening* – really listening – was a surprisingly grounding ritual. 

I've been hunting for a podcast series that just *clicks*, something beyond a random anthology.  Right now, I’m obsessed with [mention a fictional series name or style - e.g., “noir-ish tales set in a reimagined Bronzeville”]. It’s a little escape, a way to inhabit a different world without the pressure of constant visual stimulation.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps adding a specific recommendation or focusing on a particular aspect?
