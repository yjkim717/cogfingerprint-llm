## Leveling Up My Relaxation (and My Gaming!)

Okay, so I’m officially a PS4 Pro convert. Jumping in late to the console party in 2020 has been surprisingly… relaxing. After years of PC building and tweaking, there's something wonderfully simple about plopping down on the couch and just *playing*. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about immersion lately. Not just in games, but in everything. I’m debating a new headset – RIG 500 with 7.1 or Dolby Atmos? It feels silly, but chasing that extra layer of sound feels like another small step towards truly unwinding. It's all about finding those little pockets of joy, right? Anyone else feeling the need to optimize their chill time?
