**The Weight of a “No” in 2020**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of holding my breath a lot.  Lockdown, uncertainty… it was a strange mix of quiet and overwhelming.  I had this really exciting opportunity – a chance to volunteer with a local artist, someone I genuinely connected with.  She floated this idea, a little impulsive, to ditch my online classes for a few afternoons and help her with a mural. 

I, predictably, said no.  A solid, firm “no.”  I was clinging to my routine, terrified of disrupting it.  Looking back, it feels like a tiny, critical decision, a little pebble dropped into a pond of regret. 

It wasn’t a dramatic rejection, just a simple refusal. But now, scrolling through old photos, I feel this sharp pang of what-could-have-been.  It's a potent reminder that sometimes, the biggest missed opportunities aren’t about grand gestures, but the small, unspoken “no’s” that shape our days.  It’s a lesson I’m still learning, and one I suspect we all grapple with – the bittersweet weight of a chance passed.
