**Lost in Translation (and Euros!)**

It’s wild to think about how much my life shifted in 2020. Moving to Barcelona was a dream, but let me tell you, the dream quickly got a little complicated when it came to money. I’d started using Aspire budgeting – a lifesaver for keeping track of everything back home – but suddenly I was juggling two currencies, fluctuating exchange rates, and a whole new level of investment tracking. 

Honestly, the initial weeks were a panic. Seeing my savings dwindle against the Euro felt incredibly stressful. I realized I needed a completely different approach. I started researching local banking, learned the hard way about fees, and even started setting up a separate account just for those tricky international investments. It’s still a learning curve, but mastering the money game feels like a crucial part of building a life here.
