As I sipped my morning coffee in 2020, I found myself hooked on audiodramas that kept me engaged from start to finish. I ditched anthologies for non-anthology series that told a cohesive story. My go-to podcast recommendations included immersive tales that transported me to new worlds. These audio dramas became my lifestyle entertainment, a daily escape from the chaos of the pandemic. They remain my top picks for a great listen.
