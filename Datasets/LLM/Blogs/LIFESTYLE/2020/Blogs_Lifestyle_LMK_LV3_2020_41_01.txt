"Shots, Glasses, and Hollywood Stereotypes: The Unrealistic Drinking Culture in Movies"

As I binge-watched my favorite TV shows during the 2020 lockdown, I couldn't help but notice a peculiar trend - characters drinking straight liquor like it's going out of style. From whiskey to tequila, it seemed like everyone was downing shots like they're sipping water. But, as I reflected on my own social drinking experiences, I realized that this isn't exactly how we drink in real life. In reality, most of us order cocktails, sip wine, or enjoy beer with friends. So, why do Hollywood portrayals of drinking culture insist on perpetuating this stereotype? Is it to add drama or create a certain image? Whatever the reason, it's time to acknowledge the disconnect between on-screen antics and our everyday drinking habits. Let's raise a glass (of wine or beer, perhaps?) to a more realistic representation of social drinking.
