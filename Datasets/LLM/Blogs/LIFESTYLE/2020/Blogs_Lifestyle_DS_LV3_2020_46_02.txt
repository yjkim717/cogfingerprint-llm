It’s 2020, and here I am in Switzerland, trying to order a Valve Index through my friend in Germany—a simple plan, right? But Steam’s “Free Account” restrictions threw a wrench in the works. Suddenly, I’m weighing whether to buy a game just to upgrade to a paid account, all for a shot at virtual reality. It’s funny how these digital barriers remind us that even in a connected world, borders still matter. In a year when so much has shifted online, this little hiccup feels like a lesson in patience and the quirks of global tech. Sometimes, the journey to a new gadget teaches you more than the device itself ever could.
