Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the summary and keywords, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational tone, set in a 2020 context. I've tried to weave in the tech themes subtly to create a lifestyle connection.

## Lost in the Tabs, Finding My Focus

Remember 2020? It felt like we were *all* living in a giant, perpetually open browser window. Tabs for work, tabs for news (too much news!), tabs for trying to learn sourdough baking, tabs for connecting with friends… it was overwhelming. And honestly, I started feeling a similar kind of overwhelm in my coding projects.

I’ve been wrestling with React lately, and something’s been bugging me. Everyone talks about routing, routing, routing for single-page applications. It feels almost… mandatory. But I keep thinking about desktop apps. Remember those? You’d build a window, a few panels, and everything felt contained, intuitive. No jarring page reloads, just smooth transitions between components.

I started wondering if we’re overcomplicating things. Are we so caught up in the "SPA" paradigm that we’re losing sight of a simpler, more focused approach? It’s like building a sprawling mansion when a cozy, well-designed cottage would actually serve you better.

This isn't just about code, though. It’s about life. I realized I was spreading myself too thin, jumping from one thing to another, never truly *present* in any of them. Just like a browser with a hundred tabs, my attention was scattered.

So, I’m trying something new. Less frantic switching, more deliberate focus. Fewer tabs open, more time spent really *seeing* what’s in front of me. Maybe a little less routing in my code, and a lot more intentionality in my days. It’s a work in progress, but I’m already feeling a little less lost in the digital noise.

**Notes on Choices:**

*   **2020 Context:** I leaned into the feeling of digital overload and constant connection that was particularly prevalent in 2020.
*   **Lifestyle Connection:** The core idea is about focus and intentionality, drawing a parallel between the developer's frustration with routing and the feeling of being overwhelmed by too many commitments/tasks in life.
*   **Subtle Tech Integration:** The keywords are woven in naturally through the analogy of browser tabs and the discussion of React/SPAs, rather than being explicitly stated.
*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Remember 2020?", "I started wondering," and "It’s a work in progress" to create a more personal and relatable feel.
