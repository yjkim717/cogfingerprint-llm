## Finding Fuel in the Frame: Documentaries and the Staying Power of Grit

2020. Let's be honest, it’s been… a lot. With so much uncertainty swirling around, I've been gravitating towards documentaries more than ever. There's something deeply comforting, and surprisingly motivating, about witnessing someone else’s journey, especially when it's a tough one.

Recently, I devoured *Chef's Table* on Netflix, and it really struck a chord. Seeing these chefs pour their heart and soul into their craft, facing setbacks and relentless pressure, just… it reignited a little spark in me. It reminded me that perseverance isn't some abstract concept; it’s the quiet, daily grind of chasing a goal, even when it feels impossible. 

We all need a little inspiration these days. I've been thinking about *The Last Dance* too – that sheer dedication is infectious! It’s amazing how much you can learn about resilience simply by watching someone else push through. What documentaries have you been turning to for a boost lately? I'm always looking for recommendations!
