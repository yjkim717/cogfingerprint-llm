As I sat in front of my Windows machine in 2020, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the game-changer that is WSL. Microsoft's willingness to bring Linux to Windows has been a boon for developers like me. I'm torn, though - should I stick with the original WSL1 or make the switch to WSL2? Both have their perks. I'm excited to see how Microsoft and the open-source community will continue to shape the future of Linux on Windows. The possibilities are endless, and I'm eager to explore them.
