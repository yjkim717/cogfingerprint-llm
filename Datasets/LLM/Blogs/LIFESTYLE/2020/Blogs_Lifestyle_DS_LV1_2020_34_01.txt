### Finding Quiet in the Chaos

It was the summer of 2020, and my world had shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. The constant, high-pitched whir of my 3D printer—my new pandemic hobby—was starting to feel like the soundtrack to my anxiety. I was printing face shield brackets for local nurses, using PLA, but the noise was driving me up the wall.

My solution was to build an enclosure, hoping to muffle the sound. But then I hit a wall: PLA needs ventilation, and closing the door felt risky. So, I got creative. I installed a quiet, external fan with a simple duct, creating a gentle breeze to clear the air without the screech.

The moment I closed that door, the silence was profound. It wasn't just about fan noise reduction; it was about reclaiming a small piece of peace. In a year of overwhelming noise, I learned that sometimes, the best solutions aren't about stopping the machine, but about building a better, quieter space around it.
