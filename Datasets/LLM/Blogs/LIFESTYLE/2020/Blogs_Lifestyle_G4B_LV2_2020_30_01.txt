**The Weight of a Bad Choice**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was holding their breath, didn’t it? There was a strange, pervasive anxiety hanging in the air, and honestly, for a while, I felt it too.  I was scrolling through the news, seeing stories about rising drug overdoses – particularly with fentanyl – and it hit me hard. 

It reminded me of a scene from a show I was watching, "Ozark," where they depicted a clumsy attempt to mix heroin with fentanyl. It was a stark illustration of how easily things can go wrong, how a single, flawed decision can have devastating consequences. 

It wasn't about the show, though. It was about recognizing that we all make choices, and sometimes, those choices carry a weight we don’t fully understand until later.  Let's be mindful of the paths we’re choosing, and extend kindness, especially to ourselves and those struggling.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a slightly different angle?
