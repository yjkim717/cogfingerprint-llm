There’s something oddly grounding about testing mechanical keyboards in 2020, when the world outside feels so uncertain. I’ve spent afternoons clicking Cherry MX Blues and tapping on Browns, each keystroke a tiny, satisfying anchor. The tactile feedback, the audible click—it’s a small rebellion against the silence of lockdown. In a year of endless screens and digital noise, this simple, hands-on ritual reminds me that some pleasures are still wonderfully tangible. Who knew a keyboard could feel so much like coming home?
