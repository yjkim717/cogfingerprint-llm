**The Curious Case of Hollywood Liquor**

2020 was… a year, wasn’t it? I found myself watching a *lot* of movies – a coping mechanism, maybe? And I noticed something strange. Everywhere I looked, characters were casually pouring straight whiskey, neat scotch, or just plain vodka. It felt… exaggerated. 

I realized I’d rarely seen that behavior in my own social circles. We’d usually stick to beer, wine, or something mixed. It struck me as a Hollywood construct, this almost obsessive focus on hard liquor.  Maybe it’s a visual shorthand for sophistication, or a way to add drama. But it definitely made me pause and think about how we *actually* drink – and how different our reality can be from the silver screen.
