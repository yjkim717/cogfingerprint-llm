"Finding Rhythm in a Remote World: My Journey as a Scrum Master in 2020"

As I navigated the uncharted waters of remote team management in 2020, I couldn't help but reflect on my own habits and how they impacted my team's Scrum practices. With the pandemic forcing us to work from home, our daily stand-ups became virtual, and our team's punctuality began to waver. I realized that I, too, had fallen into the trap of multitasking during our virtual meetings, checking emails while others spoke. It wasn't until I took a step back and assessed my own behavior that I began to see a change. By focusing on one task at a time and modeling the behavior I expected from my team, we started to develop a stronger sense of ownership and accountability. As an Agile coach, I learned that sometimes, the most effective way to lead is to look inward and adjust our own habits first.
