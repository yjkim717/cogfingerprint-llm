Lately, 2020 has left me feeling drained, searching for a spark. So I turned to documentaries, hoping for a dose of inspiration. I started scrolling through Netflix and other platforms, looking for stories of resilience and hope.

I found one about everyday heroes in a small community. Their quiet determination, their refusal to give up—it was exactly what I needed. It didn't solve my problems, but it shifted my perspective. It reminded me that progress is often slow and built by ordinary people. Now, I make motivational viewing a small ritual. It’s a simple way to recharge and remember the good still happening in the world.
