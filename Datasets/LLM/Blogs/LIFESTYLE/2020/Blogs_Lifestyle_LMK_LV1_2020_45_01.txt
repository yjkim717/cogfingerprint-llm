"As a parent in 2020, I thought I was prepared for the financial squeeze. But having kids really tested my coast FI strategy. Suddenly, saving for the future felt like a luxury I couldn't afford. I'm not alone in this struggle. I'm on the hunt for an online community that gets it - folks who are navigating the same trade-offs and lifestyle sacrifices. Anyone out there on the same coast FI journey?"
