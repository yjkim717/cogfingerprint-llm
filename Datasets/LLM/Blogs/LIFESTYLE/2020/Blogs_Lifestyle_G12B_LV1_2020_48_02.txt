## The Shuffle Continues

February 4th, 2020. Just another day, right? Except, it meant a scramble at Phoenix Sky Harbor. United was moving from Terminal 2 to 3. It felt symbolic, somehow. Life felt like a constant shuffle lately – shifting priorities, changing routines. You're just settling in, finding your groove, and then *bam*, everything’s relocated. Guess I'll need to factor in extra rideshare time now. It’s a small thing, but it's a reminder to embrace the unexpected detours.
