## That Weird Taste and a Wobbly Feeling... Anyone Else?

Okay, so this happened to me yesterday, and I’m still a little rattled, to be honest. I was out in the garden – you know, trying to make the most of the sunshine and finally tackle that overgrown rose bush – and suddenly, *bam*. A wave of dizziness hit me. Not a gentle sway, but a proper, “whoa, the room is spinning” kind of dizziness. 

It was accompanied by a throbbing headache and the strangest thing… a metallic taste in my mouth. Seriously, like I’d been sucking on a penny. I had to sit down immediately, feeling completely wiped out. 

I’m thinking it was a combination of things. It was a scorcher of a day, and I definitely hadn’t been drinking enough water. Plus, wrestling with that rose bush was surprisingly strenuous! I’m carrying a few extra pounds these days (thanks, 2020!), and I’m realizing that even seemingly simple tasks can really take it out of you.

It passed after about half an hour, thankfully, but it got me thinking. We’re all so busy, especially now, juggling work, family, and just trying to stay sane. We push ourselves, often ignoring the little warning signs our bodies are sending. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I’m not panicking, but it was a good reminder to slow down, hydrate, and maybe not try to conquer the entire garden in one go! And definitely listen to my body – it’s usually pretty good at telling me when I’ve gone too far.
