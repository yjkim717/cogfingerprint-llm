### The Day My Body Hit the Brakes

It was supposed to be a simple Sunday. Stuck inside for months in 2020, my little garden had become my sanctuary. So, on a sweltering July afternoon, I was determined to wrestle a stubborn patch of weeds into submission.

I was so focused on the task that I ignored my body’s whispers. The first one was a strange, coppery taste in my mouth, like I’d been sucking on a penny. I shrugged it off. Then, a dull headache started to bloom behind my eyes. The final straw was the dizziness—a sudden, sickening lurch that sent me stumbling to the grass.

Sitting there, heart pounding, a terrifying thought cut through the fog: *Is this it? Do I need an ambulance?* In a year defined by a scary virus, every new symptom felt like a potential catastrophe.

Turns out, it was a brutal lesson in dehydration. As an overweight woman in my forties, I’d pushed my body too hard in the heat without a single sip of water. That moment of panic on the lawn was my body screaming what my mind had ignored: slow down. In a world that felt completely out of my control, I learned the hard way that listening to my own body is the one thing I can’t afford to neglect.
