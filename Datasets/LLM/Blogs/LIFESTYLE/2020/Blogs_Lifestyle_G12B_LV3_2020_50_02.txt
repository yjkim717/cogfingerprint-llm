## Leveling Up My Hobbies: Dioramas Meet Board Games

It's 2020, and like a lot of us, I've been diving deep into hobbies to fill the time. I've always loved building dioramas – tiny worlds crafted from foam, paint, and a whole lot of patience. Lately, I've been thinking… why not combine that with my love for board games? 

Specifically, RPGs. Imagine a sprawling dungeon crawl where the tiles aren't just cardboard, but miniature landscapes I’ve built myself! It feels like the ultimate creative fusion. 

I'm on the hunt for board games that would really *sing* with this approach. Something with a strong narrative, maybe a modular board, that allows for a lot of visual storytelling. Any recommendations out there from fellow hobbyists? Let's build something amazing together!
