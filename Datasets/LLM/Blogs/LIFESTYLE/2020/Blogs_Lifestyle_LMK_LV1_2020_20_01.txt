"As I dropped off my old gadgets at Forest Planet's electronics recycling event in 2020, I felt a sense of satisfaction. Not only was I decluttering my space, but I was also supporting a great cause - reforestation efforts. It's amazing how small actions, like recycling our electronic waste, can contribute to a larger impact. I'm inspired to continue adopting sustainable practices and encourage others to join me in making a positive change, one recycling bin at a time."
