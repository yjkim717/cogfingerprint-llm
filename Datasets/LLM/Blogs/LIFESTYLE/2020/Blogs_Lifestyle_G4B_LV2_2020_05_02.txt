**The Quiet Struggle of a Floating Bubble**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something so small – a single bubble rising through water – can suddenly feel like a massive frustration. That’s exactly how I felt a lot of 2020. I was building this little "plant tank" – a tiny, ambitious attempt at bringing a little green life into my apartment during lockdown. It was supposed to be a calming project, a mindful escape. 

But the CO2 just wasn’t diffusing properly. Tiny, frantic bubbles, barely visible, were all I got. It mirrored something I was feeling – a sense of effort going nowhere, of wanting to create something beautiful but struggling to get it right. 

I spent hours tweaking the airstone, fiddling with the hob intake, desperately trying to get that CO2 to spread. It was a frustrating reminder that sometimes, the most rewarding things take patience and a willingness to troubleshoot.  Just like figuring out how to breathe a little easier during a year that felt perpetually short of air.

Would you like me to tweak this further, or perhaps focus on a different aspect of the original summary?
