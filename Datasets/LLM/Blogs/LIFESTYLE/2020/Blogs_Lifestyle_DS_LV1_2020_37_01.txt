Remember back in 2020, when we were all suddenly homebound? I decided to dive into Minecraft, hoping to find some digital company. But wow—the online rules felt like learning a new language! All I wanted was a casual friend or two in my timezone to build a simple cottage with, maybe explore a pixelated forest together without pressure.

It made me realize how much we crave genuine connection, even in virtual spaces. Sometimes, the simplest shared moments—like placing blocks together on a quiet server—can be the most grounding. In a complicated year, that simplicity felt like a small, comforting anchor.
