## San Diego Dreaming (and the Quarantine Question)

Okay, so here's the thing: 2020 has been… a lot. And the idea of a vacation, *any* vacation, feels like a distant, shimmering dream. But a Reddit thread popped up today asking about a San Diego getaway, and it got me thinking. Is it even responsible to plan a trip right now? 

We're all navigating these ever-changing restrictions, aren't we? The desire to escape, to soak up some sunshine and culture, is real. San Diego, with its beaches and vibrant arts scene, seems like the perfect antidote to months of lockdown. But the quarantine question lingers. 

I'm genuinely curious – are you guys itching to travel? And if so, what are your biggest concerns and considerations? Let's chat!
