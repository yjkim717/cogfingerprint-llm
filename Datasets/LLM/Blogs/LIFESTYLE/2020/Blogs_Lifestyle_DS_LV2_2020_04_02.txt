The year 2020 blurred all the lines, didn’t it? Work, home, and life all bled into one messy, beautiful canvas. I remember staring at my screen, my team’s little boxes frozen or filled with distracted faces. We were all there, but we weren't *present*.

It hit me then—this wasn't just about meeting punctuality. It was about presence. I started small. I began our calls by asking a simple, non-work question. "What's one beautiful thing you noticed today?" The shift was slow but profound. We started sharing snippets of our chaotic lives—a child’s drawing, the sourdough loaf finally rising.

We weren't just improving a team habit; we were rebuilding connection. In a year that forced us apart, we had to consciously choose to show up, not just on time, but with our whole, imperfect selves. And that made all the difference.
