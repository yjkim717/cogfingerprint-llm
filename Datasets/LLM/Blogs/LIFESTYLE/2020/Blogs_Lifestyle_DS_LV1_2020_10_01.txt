It’s funny how a little red dot on a screen can send your heart racing. Back in 2020, when the world felt upside down, I found myself clinging to small comforts—including my daily check-ins on the r/stopdrinking subreddit. It was my digital sanctuary, a place where a simple upvote felt like a warm hand on my shoulder.

Then, one day, a flurry of unexpected badge notifications popped up. For a moment, I felt a jolt of anxiety. Had I slipped up? Was I being judged? It turned out to be an experimental feature Reddit staff was testing—one that misfired, sending unnecessary alerts to folks like me just trying to stay afloat.

When they disabled it, I breathed a sigh of relief. It reminded me that in a year of constant noise, what we really needed wasn’t more pings and prompts, but quiet consistency. That little community, free from digital clutter, became a steady anchor in the storm. Sometimes, the most supportive thing technology can do is just… step back.
