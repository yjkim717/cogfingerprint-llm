It’s May 2020, and like so many others, I’ve turned to my dusty bike as a pandemic-era escape. After a long, hilly ride yesterday, I hopped on the scale and was stunned to see I’d “lost” two pounds. The victory felt immediate.

But by this morning, that “loss” had mysteriously returned. My initial disappointment gave way to curiosity. A little research revealed the truth: that dramatic drop wasn’t some miracle of fat-burning. It was mostly water. All that sweat I worked up? Gone. My body also tapped into its stored glycogen for quick energy, and glycogen holds onto water like a sponge. When it’s used, that water gets released, too.

So, the number was fleeting, but the lesson stuck. The real, lasting change—the slow burn of an improved metabolism and actual fat loss—happens quietly in the background, ride after ride. The scale’s flashy numbers are just a temporary headline; the real story of health is written slowly, with patience and consistency.
