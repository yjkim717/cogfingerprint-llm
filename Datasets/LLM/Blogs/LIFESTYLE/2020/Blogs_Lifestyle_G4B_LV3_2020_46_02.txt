**The Digital Divide – And a Little Frustration**

It’s funny how even in 2020, tech feels…complicated. I was just reading about a guy in Switzerland struggling to order a Valve Index – apparently, there’s a block on free accounts there. It made me think about how differently things feel depending on where you are in the world. 

Suddenly, a simple online purchase becomes a little tangled up in rules and restrictions. It’s a reminder that the digital world isn’t always as seamless as we hope, and that sometimes, even wanting a new VR headset can lead to a minor, frustrating battle.  Anyone else feel that way?
