### Finding Peace in the Pause

It’s 2020, and the world has collectively hit the pause button. In the sudden quiet of my own four walls, I noticed something else—my own breathing. Or rather, the lack of peaceful breathing at night.

Enter my new companion: a CPAP machine. I’ll be honest, the first few nights felt like a sci-fi movie. But then I found the ResMed N30, a tiny nasal pillow mask that doesn’t make me feel like a deep-sea diver. It’s been a quiet revolution for my sleep.

This small device has become a strange metaphor for this year. It’s an adjustment, something new to clean and care for, a ritual that forces me to be still. But in that necessary maintenance—wiping down the mask, ensuring a good seal for side sleeping—I find a moment of calm. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the things we initially resist become the very tools that help us breathe easier, even when the air feels heavy. Here’s to finding small comforts in unexpected places.
