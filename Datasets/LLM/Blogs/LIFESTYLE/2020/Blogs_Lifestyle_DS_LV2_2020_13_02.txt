It’s 2020, and I’m still trying to figure out how to balance it all. Working from my kitchen table, I realized my laptop was just like that Hyper-V setup I’d been wrestling with—sometimes you can’t have everything running at once. You want the host access, the Wake-on-LAN magic, but life, like network configurations, forces choices. So I unplugged, went for a walk, and remembered that not every connection needs to be "on." Sometimes, the most productive thing you can do is let yourself—and your devices—rest.
