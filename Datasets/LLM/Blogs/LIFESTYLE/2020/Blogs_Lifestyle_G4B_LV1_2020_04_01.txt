**Lost in the Noise**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a constant battle against noise. Between the news and Zoom calls, it was hard to find a quiet space to actually *think*. That’s why I’ve been making a conscious effort to seek out bars that just... don’t have TVs. 

It’s a surprisingly huge deal. I’ve noticed how quickly conversations fizzle out when a screen dominates the space. There's something about the lack of visual distraction that forces you to really listen, to engage with the people around you. 

Last week, I stumbled upon a little place downtown with just a killer playlist and a genuinely buzzing atmosphere.  It was exactly what I needed – a place to connect, not compete with flashing lights and background noise.  Maybe it's a small thing, but it’s making a big difference in my feeling of calm.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
