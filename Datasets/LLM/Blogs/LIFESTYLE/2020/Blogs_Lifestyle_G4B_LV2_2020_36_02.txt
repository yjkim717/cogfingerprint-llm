**The Ghost in the Cloud**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How reliant we’ve become on these digital spaces. I was wrestling with a frustrating glitch last year – a complete data loss in OneNote, my go-to online notebook. I’d backed up *everything* to my desktop, but somehow, the online version just… vanished. 

It felt like a ghost had snuck in and erased my thoughts. Suddenly, a year’s worth of ideas, sketches, and random observations were gone. It was a surprisingly unsettling experience, highlighting just how vulnerable our digital lives can be. 

It made me think about the importance of not just *saving* things, but actually *feeling* like they’re secure.  Maybe it’s time to print a few more of those precious notes – a little analog grounding in a world of ever-shifting clouds.
