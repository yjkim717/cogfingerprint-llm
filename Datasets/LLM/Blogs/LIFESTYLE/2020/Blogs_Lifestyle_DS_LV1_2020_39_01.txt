It’s 2020, and I’m home more than ever. I started small: each morning, I write one goal, one thing I’m grateful for, and give myself a genuine compliment. No grand spiritual claims, just noticing how this tiny ritual shifts my focus. The days feel less heavy, a bit more mine. Funny how a little intentional kindness to yourself can quietly change everything.
