As I stepped out into the Delhi streets in 2020, I was disheartened by the blatant disregard for COVID-19 protocols. Despite being in a red zone, people seemed to have normalized the pandemic, abandoning social distancing and masking. The rising cases were a harsh reality, yet the city's residents appeared nonchalant. It's alarming to see the lockdown's lessons forgotten, and I worry that complacency will only fuel the virus's spread.
