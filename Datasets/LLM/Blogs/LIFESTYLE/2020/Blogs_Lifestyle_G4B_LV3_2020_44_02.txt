**Lost in the Dark, Found in Myself**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was chasing something – a perfect routine, a thrilling escape, a way to *feel* something amidst the uncertainty. I dove headfirst into the Vigilant mod for Dark Souls, hoping for a deep, immersive experience. The lore was impressive, meticulously crafted, and I was genuinely excited. 

But after a few hours, it just…stalled. It became a frustrating exercise in comparison, a constant measuring stick against the original Dark Souls. The challenge evaporated, replaced by a dull, echoing boredom. It felt like I was searching for a feeling I couldn’t quite grasp, and the mod just wasn't delivering. 

Honestly, I ended up uninstalling it and booting up the base game. There’s a strange comfort in returning to the familiar, to the raw, unapologetic difficulty of the original. Sometimes, the most profound experiences aren’t found in meticulously designed additions, but in simply *being* present with what you already love. It reminded me that chasing an idealized version of something can often rob you of the joy of the real thing.
