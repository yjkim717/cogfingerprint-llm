It’s 2020, and my digital life is a mess. My OneNote notebook—where I’ve poured thoughts, recipes, and quarantine musings—suddenly looks empty on my desktop. Yet, it’s all there on my phone, mocking my reliance on tech. It’s a strange metaphor for this year: things feel missing, out of sync, but maybe they’re just hiding in plain sight. I’m learning to trust that what matters isn’t lost, just waiting for the right connection. Sometimes, life’s glitches teach the deepest lessons.
