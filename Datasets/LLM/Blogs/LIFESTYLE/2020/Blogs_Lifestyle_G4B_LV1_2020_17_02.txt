**The Weight of the Wheel (and My Worries)**

Okay, real talk. 2020 was… a lot. But amidst the toilet rolls and Zoom calls, I was battling a different kind of panic: the theory test. I’d booked my driving lessons, felt reasonably confident behind the wheel, but the thought of the DVSA test itself? It was a full-blown anxiety attack waiting to happen. 

Specifically, hazard perception was my nemesis. Those little coloured blobs seemed to actively mock me. I was spending hours staring at YouTube videos, trying to remember every possible road scenario, but it just felt… overwhelming. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? Spending weeks mastering the pedals, yet completely paralyzed by a multiple-choice question. I confided in my instructor, admitting I was genuinely struggling. He gently reminded me that everyone gets anxious, and that preparation – not perfection – was key.  Right now, I’m focusing on small wins and trying to breathe. Wish me luck!
