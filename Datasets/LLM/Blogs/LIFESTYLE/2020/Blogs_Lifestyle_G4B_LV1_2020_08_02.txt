**The Weight of “Helping”**

Okay, let's be real. 2020 was… a lot. We were all trying to navigate a world that felt perpetually on the edge, and honestly, I found myself trapped in a weird little vortex of frustration. It started with my partner’s mom, Carol. Now, Carol *means* well. She’s genuinely a lovely woman, always offering a casserole or a phone call. But lately, it’s felt less like genuine care and more like a relentless tide of “helpful” intrusions. 

It’s not just the calls – though those are frequent. It's the constant emails with links to articles about “optimizing” our garden, unsolicited advice on our finances, and detailed instructions on how to make the *perfect* sourdough starter (seriously, we don't even *like* sourdough).  And then there’s the subtle guilt trips. “Oh, you guys seem a little stressed… are you *sure* you’re managing everything alright?” 

I started to feel this creeping anxiety, a constant need to justify my choices, to prove that I wasn’t failing. It felt… exhausting. And then the question hit me, a really uncomfortable one: am I just a default caregiver? Am I subconsciously agreeing to every request, reinforcing this behavior because it feels easier than saying no?

I started reading about codependency, and suddenly, a lot of it clicked. It wasn’t about *her* – Carol was genuinely trying to be supportive. It was about *me* and my ingrained need to please, to avoid conflict.  It’s something I hadn't really recognized before, buried under layers of wanting to be a “good” daughter-in-law. 

Setting boundaries felt terrifying, like admitting I couldn't handle everything.  But I realized that protecting my mental health – and my relationship – actually *required* it. It’s been a slow process, a lot of mumbled “thank yous” followed by carefully worded declinations.  I’m learning to say, “That’s really thoughtful, but we’ve got things under control,” without feeling the need to over-explain. 

It's not about pushing her away, it’s about creating a little space, a little breathing room, for *us*.  And honestly, it’s lighter than I ever imagined.  It’s a weird, ongoing experiment in self-respect, and I’m starting to think it’s one of the most important ones I’ll ever undertake.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
