**The Great CO2 Experiment (and Why I Need a Backup Plan)**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of trying to streamline everything. I’d been researching ways to make my home brewing a little more efficient, and I really wanted to move away from relying solely on electricity. So, I’m seriously contemplating switching to pressurized CO2 for my batches. The idea of a consistent, controlled pressure is appealing, but then I realized – what happens when the power goes out? 

I’m now hunting for a manual solenoid valve – a simple, reliable way to shut things down. It’s a small thing, but it feels important to have a little redundancy, especially when life throws curveballs.  It’s all about building a slightly more resilient routine, right?
