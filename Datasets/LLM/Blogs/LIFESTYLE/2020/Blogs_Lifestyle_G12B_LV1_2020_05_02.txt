## Small Bubbles, Big Calm: My Little Tank & a Year of Slowing Down

It’s funny, isn’t it? How the things we latch onto sometimes end up reflecting a whole lot more than we initially realize. For me, that thing has been my little planted aquarium. I’ve always enjoyed it, but 2020… 2020 made it *essential*.

The world felt like it was constantly bubbling with anxiety. News cycles were relentless, plans were cancelled, and the constant uncertainty was exhausting.  I found myself staring into that tank more and more, drawn to the quiet, predictable rhythm of the plants and fish.

Then I noticed the CO2 wasn't diffusing as well as it should. The plants were struggling a bit. Instead of shelling out for an expensive system, I started tinkering. A little DIY project – a tiny airstone nestled in the outflow of my HOB filter, creating a flurry of micro bubbles. It was surprisingly satisfying. 

It wasn't about the perfect, professional setup. It was about the process, the small victory of problem-solving with what I had. It was about finding a little pocket of calm, a miniature ecosystem I could nurture.  And, honestly, watching those tiny bubbles rise, I felt a strange sense of peace.  Maybe small, affordable solutions, like a little airstone, can offer a bit of stability and quiet joy, even in the midst of a chaotic world.  Who knew a fish tank could teach you so much?
