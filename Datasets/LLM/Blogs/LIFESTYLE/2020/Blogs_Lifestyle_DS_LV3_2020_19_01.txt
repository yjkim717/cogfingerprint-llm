Staring at the lumber aisle in Home Depot, I felt a familiar itch to start a new woodworking project—a simple raised garden bed for the 2020 lockdown garden. But then I saw the price tag on the pressure treated lumber. My heart sank. Wasn't this stuff half the price last year?

I pulled out my phone, doing a quick mental cost comparison with projects past. The numbers didn't lie; my weekend ambition had just gotten significantly more expensive. The classic DIY dilemma hit me: do I bite the bullet and build now, embracing the therapeutic sawdust and satisfaction? Or do I wait, gambling that prices might fall back to earth later this summer, saving a few bucks but losing the perfect planting window?

It’s more than just wood; it’s a question of timing, budget, and that irreplaceable joy of creating something with your own two hands. What’s a little price increase against that?
