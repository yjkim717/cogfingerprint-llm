"Rethinking My Morning Routine in Lockdown"

As I sipped my coffee on that first Monday morning of lockdown in March 2020, I felt a pang of uncertainty. With the world outside my window suddenly frozen, my daily routine was turned upside down. No commute, no office chatter, just the eerie silence of an empty apartment. I was forced to rethink my morning ritual, and in doing so, discovered a new appreciation for the simple things.

Gone were the days of rushing to get ready, grabbing a quick breakfast, and dashing out the door. Instead, I found myself with an abundance of time, and a blank slate to shape my day. At first, it was disorienting. I'd wake up late, scroll mindlessly through my phone, and stumble into the day without a clear plan.

But as the weeks went by, I began to establish a new rhythm. I'd wake up early, take a quiet moment to meditate, and then embark on a leisurely walk around the block. The fresh air and gentle exercise invigorated me, and I started the day feeling more grounded.

As I settled into this new routine, I realized that the lockdown had given me a rare gift â€“ the chance to reconnect with myself, and redefine what it means to start the day on a positive note. It wasn't about rushing to get somewhere; it was about savoring the stillness, and finding joy in the everyday moments. As I look back, I'm grateful for that unexpected reset, and the newfound appreciation it brought to my daily life.
