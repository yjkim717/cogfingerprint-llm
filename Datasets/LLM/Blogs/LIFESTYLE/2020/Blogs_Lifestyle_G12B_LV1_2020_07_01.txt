## The Box of Unsent Letters and a Whole Lot of Worry

It’s September 2020. The air is crisp, the leaves are *almost* starting to turn, and my daughter, Lily, is officially a college freshman. A monumental moment, right? It should be. Instead, it’s mostly a knot of anxiety twisting in my stomach.

She’s settled into her dorm, a tiny space that somehow feels both exciting and incredibly vulnerable. We video-called yesterday, and she looked…fine. A little overwhelmed, maybe, but mostly excited about classes and meeting new people. But underneath that bright, eager face, I saw a flicker of something else. A quiet apprehension.

Because let's be honest, "college experience" in 2020 isn't exactly what anyone signed up for. The word "quarantine" hangs over everything like a persistent fog. The university has protocols, of course – testing, mask mandates, social distancing. But the reality is, one case could trigger a campus-wide shutdown, and suddenly Lily's dream semester could be confined to four walls.

And then there's *us*. My husband’s got a slightly compromised immune system, and I… well, I’m just a mom, fiercely protective and already overthinking every possible scenario. Part of me wants to pack her bags and bring her home. Safe. Secure. *Here*.

But is that really what she needs? Or am I projecting my own fears onto her? She’s 18. She needs to learn independence, to navigate the world – even a world grappling with a pandemic.

I started writing her a letter last night, a long, rambling thing filled with advice, reassurance, and a whole lot of “be carefuls.” I didn't send it. Instead, it sits in a box with a few others, a testament to the unspoken worries swirling around our house. It’s a strange feeling, wanting to shield your child while simultaneously knowing you have to let them go. This year, letting go feels a whole lot heavier.
