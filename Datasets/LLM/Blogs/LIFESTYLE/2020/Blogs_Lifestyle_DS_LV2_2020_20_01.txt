That garage cleanout in 2020 was a real project. Staring at the pile of old electronics, I felt a familiar pang of guilt—all that e-waste destined for a landfill. But then I found Forest Planet’s recycling drive.

Dropping everything off was simple, but the real win was learning that my old laptop and tangled cables weren't just being diverted from a trash heap; they were actively funding reforestation. It turned a mundane chore into a small, meaningful act. Sometimes, the right choice is surprisingly easy.
