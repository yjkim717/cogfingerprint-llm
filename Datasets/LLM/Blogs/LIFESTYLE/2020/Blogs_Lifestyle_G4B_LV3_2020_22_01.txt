It’s funny, isn’t it? 2020. A year of enforced stillness, of staring at screens and feeling… restless. I found myself fixated on a broken keyboard, a tiny, frustrating failure. But it quickly spiraled into something more – a full-blown obsession with mechanical keyboards and those Cherry MX switches. I desperately wanted to *feel* the difference, to understand the click and the weight. 

Without a chance to actually visit a store, I was lost in online forums, reading reviews, and imagining the perfect tactile experience. It felt a little absurd, this digital quest for a simple keyboard, but maybe it was exactly what I needed – a small, focused way to feel like I was still building something, even when the world felt chaotic.
