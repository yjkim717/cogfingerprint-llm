### My Global Wallet: Finding Financial Calm in 2020’s Chaos

It was mid-2020, and the world felt like it had shrunk to the size of my apartment. Yet, my finances were sprawled across three different countries. I was an expat with a bank account back home, a local currency for daily life, and a sad-looking investment portfolio that I hadn’t glanced at since the lockdown began. I felt financially seasick, tossed between exchange rates and forgotten subscriptions.

That’s when I discovered Aspire Budgeting. It wasn't a magic wand, but it gave me a map. Instead of trying to cram everything into one chaotic spreadsheet, I created separate budgets. One for my life here, one for my commitments back home, and a dedicated tracker for my investments. Seeing those different “wallets” side-by-side was a revelation.

Suddenly, sending money home wasn't a stressful guess; it was a planned line item. Watching my investments had a designated space, separate from my grocery budget, which stopped me from panicking over market dips while buying avocados. In a year where I had control over so little, this system gave me a quiet sense of command over my cross-border life. It taught me that financial peace isn’t about having all your money in one place, but about having a clear view of it, no matter where in the world it resides.
