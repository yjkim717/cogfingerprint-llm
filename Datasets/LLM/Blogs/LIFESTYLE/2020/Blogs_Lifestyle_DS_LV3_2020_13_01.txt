Looking back on 2020, WSL truly became my unexpected lifeline. As a developer, I’d struggled with juggling Windows and Linux workflows—until Microsoft’s open-source approach bridged that gap beautifully. WSL2’s seamless virtualization let me dive into projects without rebooting, while WSL1’s clever API translation kept things lightweight. It’s amazing how technology can reshape our daily routines and passions. Now, I’m left wondering: what’s next? Will the future lean into raw virtualization power or refine that elegant translation layer? Either way, I’m grateful for how it’s transformed my craft and curiosity.
