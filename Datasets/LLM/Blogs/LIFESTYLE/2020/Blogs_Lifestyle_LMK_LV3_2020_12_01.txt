As I navigated the world of CPAP therapy in 2020, I found myself intimately acquainted with the ResMed N30 nasal pillow mask. While it was a game-changer for my sleep apnea, I struggled to adjust to its unique design, especially when sleeping on my side. The mask's comfort was a blessing, but I worried about its durability and cleaning. I soon discovered that regular maintenance was key to its longevity. What about alternatives, though? I began exploring other nasal pillow masks and CPAP options, seeking the perfect fit for my restless nights. For fellow side sleepers, I learned to experiment with different pillow arrangements and mask adjustments to minimize discomfort. If you're new to CPAP, I encourage you to share your experiences and tips. Let's work together to find comfort in a restful night's sleep. Have you tried alternative masks or techniques for side sleeping?
