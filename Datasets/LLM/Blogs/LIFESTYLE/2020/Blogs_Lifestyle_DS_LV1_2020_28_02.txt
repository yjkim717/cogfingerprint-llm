**The Scale is a Liar (And Other 2020 Revelations)**

Staring at the scale after a grueling 30-mile ride, I felt a familiar mix of triumph and confusion. I was two pounds lighter! But was it a real victory?

In 2020, my bike became my sanctuary. But I started noticing a pattern: a significant "weight loss" after a long ride would often creep back after a hearty meal and some serious hydration. It got me thinking—what was I actually losing?

A deep dive (read: frantic Googling) revealed the truth. That immediate drop wasn't some miraculous fat meltaway. My body was first burning through its stored carbs (glycogen), and guess what’s bound to glycogen? Water. A lot of it. So, a good chunk of that "weight loss" was just water weight, literally sweating out the stress of this wild year.

It was a humbling lesson. The quick, dramatic number was a fleeting illusion. The real, lasting change comes from the consistent calorie burn that quietly boosts my metabolism ride after ride. Now, I hydrate relentlessly and trust the slow, steady process. The scale might lie day-to-day, but the feeling of strength and clarity? That’s undeniably real.
