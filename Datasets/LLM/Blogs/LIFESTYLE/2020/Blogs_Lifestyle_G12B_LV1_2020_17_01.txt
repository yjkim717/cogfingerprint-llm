## The Unexpected Comfort of Digital Worlds

Okay, so I just finished *Yakuza Kiwami 2*. Seriously, what a ride! It's funny how getting completely lost in a sprawling, fictional world – Kiryu's battles, Haruka's spirit – can be such a balm in 2020. With everything feeling so…uncertain, escaping into a vibrant, story-driven game felt surprisingly comforting. Now, I'm desperately hoping Sega brings the older *Like a Dragon* titles to PC. Gotta keep that momentum going!
