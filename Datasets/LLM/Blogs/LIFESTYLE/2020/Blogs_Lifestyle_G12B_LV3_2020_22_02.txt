## The Basement, the Numbers, and a Whole Lot of Worry (2020 Edition)

It’s funny, isn’t it? How 2020 just keeps throwing curveballs. We’re all navigating a global pandemic, trying to stay safe, and suddenly, I’m staring at a test result that reads 5-9 pCi/L. Radon. In my basement. 

Honestly, I hadn't even *thought* about radon before. It just wasn't on the radar amidst the hand sanitizer and social distancing. But now, here it is, a silent, invisible threat lurking beneath our feet. 

The advice is clear: mitigation is recommended. But the thought of having someone traipse through our house, potentially bringing COVID-19 with them, feels… complicated. It’s a risk assessment layered on top of another risk assessment. 

I’m wrestling with it, trying to balance the long-term health concerns of radon exposure with the immediate anxieties of the pandemic. Anyone else feeling this constant push and pull of conflicting worries these days? Just trying to keep my family safe, one hesitant decision at a time.
