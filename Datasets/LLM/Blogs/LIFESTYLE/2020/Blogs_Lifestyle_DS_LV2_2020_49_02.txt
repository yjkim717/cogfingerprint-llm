That frantic March of 2020, my budget spreadsheet was a sea of red. My "Available to Budget" was deeply negative, yet my account balances were fine. The culprit? My credit card. I’d dutifully tracked my panic-buying transactions, but hadn’t budgeted for them. It was a perfect metaphor for life then—everything felt upside down. The fix was simple, but the lesson stuck: you can’t manage what you don’t consciously acknowledge, with money or with fear.
