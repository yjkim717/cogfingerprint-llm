## The Lumber Ledger: A 2020 Reality Check

It’s funny how seemingly small things can really highlight the shifts happening around us, isn't it? I was just looking at lumber prices the other day, specifically pressure-treated lumber for a little deck project I’ve been dreaming about. And wow. Compared to what I was paying back in 2017, it’s a *serious* jump. 

Suddenly, that deck feels a little less urgent. It’s not just about the wood itself, it’s about everything else that’s going on in 2020. We’re all adjusting, re-evaluating priorities. Maybe this is a sign to pause, to wait and see if the market settles a bit. 

It’s a small decision, I know, but it feels bigger than that. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best thing you can do is be patient, and maybe find a different kind of project to occupy your time in the meantime. Anyone else feeling this kind of delayed gratification vibe lately?
