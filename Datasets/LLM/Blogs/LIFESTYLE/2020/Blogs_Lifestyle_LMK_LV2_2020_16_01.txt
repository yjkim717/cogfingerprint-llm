"Blasting Off into the Unknown: My Space Industry Aspirations"

As I sat in my dorm room in early 2020, surrounded by textbooks and scattered notes on computer engineering, I couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement. I was on the cusp of launching my career, but I knew I needed to take my skills to the next level. With the space industry booming, I set my sights on joining the ranks of innovators pushing the boundaries of what's possible. But, I wondered, how do I get there? I began exploring side projects that would give me hands-on experience with ml/ai development and low-level programming. As I dove into coding challenges and personal projects, I realized that building a strong CV wasn't just about listing skills â€“ it's about telling a story of passion and perseverance. My journey was just beginning, and I was ready to blast off into the unknown.
