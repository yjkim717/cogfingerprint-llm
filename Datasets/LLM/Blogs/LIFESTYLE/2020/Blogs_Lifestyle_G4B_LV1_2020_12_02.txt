**Chasing Pixels and a Little Peace of Mind**

It feels a little silly admitting this, but 2020 was… a year.  Lockdown brought a strange shift, and suddenly, staring at a screen all day felt less like work and more like a default state. I started obsessing over upgrading my PC – a ridiculous, expensive hobby, really. 

I was dreaming of a beast: a Ryzen 9 5900x, an RTX 3090, a gorgeous motherboard… basically, a machine that could handle anything I threw at it. It wasn’t about *doing* more, but about feeling less tethered to the constant need to be productive. 

Building that PC was strangely meditative. A tangible goal in a world of uncertainty. It’s a ridiculous indulgence, maybe, but it gave me a little corner of control and a quiet space to just *be*.
