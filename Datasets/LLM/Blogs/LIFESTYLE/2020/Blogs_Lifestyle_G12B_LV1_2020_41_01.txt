>## The Unblinking Glass & the Cinematic Glow

Something's been rattling around in my head lately, sparked by endless nights of streaming during this weird 2020. It’s about drinking in movies. Think Ray Donovan, or even the more recent *Kingdom* – characters slamming straight whiskey, neat, seemingly without pause. It’s… intense.

Realistically, how often do you *actually* see people just chugging liquor in real life? We’re more likely to be nursing a cocktail, sharing a beer with friends, or sipping wine with dinner. Yet, on screen, it's a shorthand for brooding, for pain, for a world just slightly askew.

It makes you wonder what that says about our fascination with portraying struggle. Is the neat glass of whiskey a quicker, more dramatic way to signify a character's turmoil than, say, a quiet conversation? Maybe. Or maybe it’s just a cinematic trope we’ve all become accustomed to, a visual cue signaling something’s not quite right. Either way, it's a curious observation from a year spent primarily indoors, bathed in the glow of the screen.
