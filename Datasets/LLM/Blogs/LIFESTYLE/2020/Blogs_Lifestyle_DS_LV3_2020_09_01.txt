It’s 2020, and life feels like a cosmic void some days—uncertain, directionless. But I’ve learned to be my own travelling merchant, seeking out those rare, legendary gems of joy: a quiet sunrise, a friend’s voice over the phone. They’re scarce, but they’re there. With patience, like forging cosmic steel, I build small, steady routines—lighthouses guiding me through the fog. Progress isn’t always fast, but it’s real. And in the stillness, I find my way, one small light at a time.
