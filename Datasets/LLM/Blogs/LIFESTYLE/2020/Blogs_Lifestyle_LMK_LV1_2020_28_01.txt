"As I floated in the space station's lounge, I pondered a quirky question: would a boomerang still work in a ship with a simulated atmosphere? In 2020, we're making huge strides in space travel, but sometimes it's the simple things that stump me. I imagined throwing a boomerang in the ship's 'room' with 1 atmosphere - would it return to my hand like it does on Earth? The thought was a fun distraction from the stars outside."
