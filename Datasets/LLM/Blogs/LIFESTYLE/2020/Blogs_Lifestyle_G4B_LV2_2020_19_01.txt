**The Year the Wood Got Expensive**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of unexpected shifts, didn’t it? Remember how everything felt…uncertain? Well, I had a surprisingly personal experience that really captured that feeling. I decided to finally tackle that old woodworking project I’d been putting off – building a little deck for the backyard. 

I’d planned it for ages, but then I went to Home Depot to get the pressure-treated lumber. The price tags hit me like a wave. It was dramatically higher than I remembered from 2017. Suddenly, my little project felt a lot bigger, and a lot more expensive. 

It made me think about how these small, everyday things – the materials for a simple deck – can be affected by the bigger, global shifts happening around us. It was a tiny, frustrating reminder that even when we’re focused on our own little corners of the world, we’re all connected to something much larger.
