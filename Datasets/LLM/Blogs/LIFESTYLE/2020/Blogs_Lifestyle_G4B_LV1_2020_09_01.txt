**The Weight of Shiny Things**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2020 felt like a year of hoarding. Not necessarily *stuff*, but things we desperately wanted – a good connection, a sense of security, even just a little bit of joy. Like endlessly grinding for those legendary gems in Forager, I found myself chasing fleeting satisfaction.  Collecting cosmic steel, just to… have it. 

Maybe it’s a habit, a way to feel like I was building something, even when the world felt shaky.  I’m trying to shift that now, focusing on *using* what I have, instead of just accumulating.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps adjust the tone or focus, or generate a different style of post?
