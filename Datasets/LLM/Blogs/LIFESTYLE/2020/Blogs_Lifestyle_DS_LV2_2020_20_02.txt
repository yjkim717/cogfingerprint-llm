### The Year I Learned to Stop Assuming

2020 was the year we all became armchair psychologists, wasn’t it? Watching people react so differently to the same global crisis had me constantly asking, “Why are they acting like that?”

I’d see a neighbor not wearing a mask and immediately label them as selfish or careless. It was my go-to reaction. But then, stuck at home, I started reading about cognitive biases for a project. I stumbled upon the “Fundamental Attribution Error”—our tendency to blame people’s character for their actions, while ignoring their situation.

It hit me like a ton of bricks. That neighbor? Maybe they were a terrified senior with foggy glasses, or a parent just trying to get a screaming toddler inside. I was so quick to judge, I never considered the context.

This small shift—from judging the person to considering their situation—was my biggest 2020 lesson. It didn’t solve the world’s problems, but it made my little corner of it feel a whole lot more compassionate.
