It’s 2020, and my iPad Pro was supposed to be my escape hatch. Instead, I’ve spent two weeks staring at the same Xbox Live sign-in screen in Minecraft Earth. I’ve deleted, reinstalled, and sighed more times than I can count. In a year of so much waiting, this tiny, stubborn loading screen feels weirdly symbolic. Sometimes, the universe just says “not yet,” whether it’s for an adventure in an AR world or simply getting through the day.
