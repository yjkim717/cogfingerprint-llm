I still remember the thrill of tweaking my rig in 2020. I tried overclocking my i5 6500 on a Gigabyte Z170MD3H motherboard, but it was a non-starter - the processor wasn't K-series. I learned that sometimes, it's not about pushing limits, but knowing when to accept them. That experience taught me to appreciate the beauty of balance in tech and life.
