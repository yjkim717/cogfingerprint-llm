It’s 2020, and I’ve spent more nights than I care to admit watching characters on TV knock back straight whiskey like it’s water. Meanwhile, my own "big night in" involves a carefully crafted cocktail or a simple glass of wine. It got me thinking—why does Hollywood cling to this trope?

In real life, social drinking is about connection, not just the burn of liquor. We toast with champagne, share a beer, or mix a fun drink for a friend. That straight-from-the-bottle swig feels more like a dramatic shortcut than a genuine moment. Maybe it’s time for our screens to reflect the slower, more relatable rituals we actually share. After all, isn’t reality compelling enough?
