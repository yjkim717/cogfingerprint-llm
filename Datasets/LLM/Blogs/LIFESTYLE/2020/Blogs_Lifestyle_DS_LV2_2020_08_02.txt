Of all the things I imagined when my husband and I signed the papers for our sweet little Cape Cod, a shared backyard with my mother-in-law wasn't one of them. The "For Sale" sign next door went up the same week our moving truck arrived. We joked about it over pizza boxes in our empty living room. "How convenient!" we said. "Free babysitting!" we laughed. We were so, so naive.

It’s 2020. The world has shrunk to the size of our homes, and my world has shrunk to include a daily, front-row seat to the Carol Show. Carol is my mother-in-law. She is a force of nature, a woman who believes that love is spelled C-O-N-T-R-O-L. Her house is twenty-seven steps from my back door. I’ve counted.

The trouble started subtly, back when "subtle" was still a concept we understood. It was little things. A "helpful" key left under her mat "just in case." Then it was her letting herself in to water my plants while I was at the grocery store. "They looked thirsty, dear," she'd say, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. My husband, Mark, would just shrug. "That's just how she is. She means well."

But 2020 stripped away all the buffers. No more offices to escape to, no more weekend trips to reset. We were all home, all the time, and so was she. Our projects became her projects. We decided to build a raised garden bed—a pandemic cliché, I know. It was supposed to be our thing, a messy, rewarding family endeavor. But within an hour, Carol was there, leaning over the fence.

"You're putting the posts in wrong," she declared, not as a suggestion, but as a decree. "My first husband, God rest his soul, always used cedar. That pressure-treated wood will leach chemicals into your tomatoes."

Mark, ever the peacemaker, stopped what he was doing. "She might have a point, honey."

I stood there, a bag of soil in my hands, feeling the boundaries of my own life dissolve like sugar in water. It wasn't about the garden bed. It was about the thousand tiny cuts. The unsolicited advice on our son's homeschooling schedule. The comments about how I "let" the laundry pile up. The way she’d look at our takeout containers with a sigh that could wilt lettuce.

The emotional manipulation is her master tool. If we try to establish a rule—like, please call before coming over—it’s met not with anger, but with a performance of wounded fragility. "I just thought I was part of the family," she'd say, her voice trembling. "I suppose I'll just be alone in my house, then." The guilt is a thick, smothering blanket. Mark, programmed by a lifetime of this, immediately starts backpedaling. "Mom, no, that's not what we meant..."

I've spent nights lying awake, the blue glow of my phone illuminating my frustration, searching for answers in online forums filled with women just like me. The keyword is always "boundaries." It sounds so simple, so clean. You just... set them. But how do you set a boundary with a woman who considers your life an extension of her own? How do you
