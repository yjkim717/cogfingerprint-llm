As I binge-watched my favorite TV shows during the 2020 lockdown, I couldn't help but notice a peculiar trend - characters gulping down straight liquor like it's water. I mean, who does that in real life? Not me, and I'm pretty sure not my friends. In our social gatherings, we sip on cocktails or enjoy a cold beer, but rarely do we see someone downing shots of whiskey or tequila. It got me thinking, why does Hollywood insist on perpetuating this trope? Is it to add drama or make a character seem edgy? Whatever the reason, it's time to rethink our on-screen drinking culture. Let's make it more relatable and less like a caricature. After all, real-life socializing is about having fun with friends, not competing in a drinking contest. It's time for a more realistic representation of how we actually socialize and enjoy a drink together.
