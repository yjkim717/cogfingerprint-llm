## What If Rocky 4 Happened *After* Chernobyl? (A Weird Thought for a Weird Year)

Okay, hear me out. It started as a silly thought, a genuine "shitpost" as the internet would say, but it’s stuck with me. Imagine *Rocky IV*, but released in, say, 1987, *after* Chernobyl. Suddenly, that whole "USA vs. USSR" boxing match feels… different, doesn't it? 

2020 has been a year of confronting uncomfortable realities, of seeing the world shift in unpredictable ways. Thinking about Rocky facing Ivan Drago against the backdrop of a nuclear disaster just highlights how easily narratives can be twisted by real-world events. It’s a strange, almost unsettling thought, but it’s also a reminder that even escapist entertainment isn't immune to the weight of history.
