## The Quiet Hum of Coasting

It's 2020, and the world feels… precarious. Between the pandemic and a general sense of economic uncertainty, a lot of us are re-evaluating what "enough" looks like. I’ve been quietly exploring a concept called Coast FI – Financial Independence, but with a twist. Instead of aggressively pursuing early retirement, it’s about reaching a point where your investments could, theoretically, support you if you *did* want to stop working.

It's a surprisingly comforting idea. For me, it's less about quitting my job and more about a shift in perspective. Less hustle, more appreciating what I have. It's meant some conscious sacrifices – fewer impulse purchases, more home cooking – but the feeling of breathing room is worth it. 

I’ve been looking for others thinking along these lines, a little community to share experiences. It feels like a quieter, more sustainable path to financial peace, and I'm curious if anyone else feels the same.
