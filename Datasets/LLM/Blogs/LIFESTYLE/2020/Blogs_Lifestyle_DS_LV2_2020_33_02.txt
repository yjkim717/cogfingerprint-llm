Of all the things I thought I’d be Googling in the spring of 2020, “is it okay to not be okay with my body?” was pretty high on the list. There I was, in my apartment that had suddenly become my entire world, staring at a screen that reflected a version of myself I barely recognized. The world had stopped, but the internal monologue in my head was on a frantic, endless loop.

Before the lockdowns, my understanding of body positivity felt simple, almost theoretical. It was about challenging the assumption that a person’s weight is a direct billboard for their health. It was about celebrating diversity and pushing back against weight stigma. I’d nod along to empowering posts, a silent ally in a fight I thought was happening out there, to other people.

But in the stillness of 2020, the fight came home. It was just me, my sweatpants, and the relentless intimacy of my own thoughts. The “health” everyone was desperately trying to preserve felt like it was being measured in sourdough starters and daily jogs, and my body, with its soft edges and newfound anxiety, didn’t feel like it fit the bill. I realized I had been carrying a hidden stigma, not against others, but against myself. I had accepted the idea that all bodies are good bodies, except, it seemed, for my own when it didn't feel "productive" or "healthy."

My turning point came during a video call with a friend who lives with a chronic disability. She was talking about the constant, exhausting work of having to prove her worth in a world that equates her body with limitation. She said, “My value isn’t conditional on my health. My body is just my home.”

It hit me with the force of a truth I’d been avoiding. I had been making my own worth conditional. Conditional on a number on a scale, on fitting into pre-pandemic jeans, on looking like I had my life together when the entire world had fallen apart.

Letting go of that has been the real work. It’s not about achieving a state of perpetual, radiant self-love. Some days, it’s just about neutrality. It’s about looking in the mirror and thinking, “This is the body that got me through a global pandemic. It held my fear and my laughter. It is my home.” And for the first time in a long time, that feels like more than enough.
