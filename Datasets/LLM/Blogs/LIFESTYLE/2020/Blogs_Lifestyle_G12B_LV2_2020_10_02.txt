## Finding the Funny & the Brave in a Year That Feels Like… Everything

2020. Just saying it feels heavy, doesn’t it? It’s a year that’s been a tangled mess of uncertainty, anxiety, and, let’s be honest, a whole lot of staring at the ceiling. I think we’ve all been searching for ways to cope, to find glimmers of light in the darkness. And lately, I’ve realized a surprising amount of that light has been coming from the most unexpected places: a book and a TV show.

I know, sounds frivolous, right? When the world is… well, *this*, what’s the point of indulging in entertainment? But I've come to believe it's precisely *because* the world is this that we need it. We need moments of escape, moments of connection, moments that remind us we're not alone in feeling utterly bewildered.

I recently re-read Brené Brown’s *Daring Greatly*, and it hit me in a completely different way than it did years ago. Before, I appreciated the theory – the importance of vulnerability, of embracing imperfection. Now, in the midst of a pandemic and all the accompanying chaos, it feels like a lifeline. The idea that showing up, even when you’re scared, even when you’re unsure, is where the real growth happens? It’s profoundly comforting. It’s permission to *not* have it all together, and to be okay with that.

And then there's *Schitt's Creek*. Oh, *Schitt's Creek*. If you haven't watched it, please, *please* do yourself a favor. This show about a wealthy family who lose everything and are forced to relocate to a small town they once bought as a joke is, surprisingly, a masterclass in resilience, empathy, and finding joy in the simplest of things. It's hilarious, yes, but it’s also deeply moving. Seeing the Roses, initially so closed off and judgmental, slowly open themselves up to connection and community… it’s genuinely heartwarming.

It’s a strange combination, a book about vulnerability and a sitcom about a quirky family, but both have offered me a surprising amount of solace and perspective this year. Maybe it's a reminder that even in the midst of difficulty, there's space for growth, for laughter, and for finding a little bit of grace. And maybe, just maybe, that’s enough to keep going.
