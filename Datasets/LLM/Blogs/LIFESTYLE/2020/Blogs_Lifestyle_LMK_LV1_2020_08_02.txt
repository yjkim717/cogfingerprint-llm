**The Blurred Lines of Family Boundaries: A Lesson in Adulting**

As I sit here sipping my coffee, I'm reflecting on the chaos that ensued this past weekend. My partner, Mike, and I were trying to enjoy a rare family day off with our kids, but it quickly turned into a stressful afternoon. The culprit? His mom, who just so happens to live next door. I love her, but oh, the boundary issues.

It started innocently enough. She would occasionally pop over to borrow something or ask to watch the kids for a bit. At first, we were happy to oblige, thinking it was a great way to build a relationship with her grandkids. But over time, her visits became more frequent, and her "help" began to feel suffocating. She would drop by unannounced, make herself at home, and start telling the kids what to do. Newsflash: they're not her kids.

As we navigated the challenges of 2020, with COVID-19 turning our world upside down, I thought we were all on the same page. We were trying to create a sense of normalcy for our kids, and Mike's mom was eager to be involved. But what I didn't realize was that her involvement was rooted in a deeper need for control. As we later discovered, her behavior was a classic case of enmeshment – a pattern of narcissistic behavior that we'd been unwittingly enabling.

It wasn't until we had a frank conversation with her that we realized the extent of the issue. She felt like she was being left out, that we were excluding her from the kids' lives. But the truth was, we were struggling to establish our own identity as a family unit. We were still figuring out our own rhythms, our own way of doing things, and her constant interference was making it impossible.

As we set boundaries with her, I felt a mix of emotions – guilt, anxiety, and a dash of resentment. Was I being too harsh? Was I being unfair? But as we stood firm, something shifted. We began to assert our independence, to establish our own routines, and to prioritize our own needs. It was a crash course in adulting, and I'm not gonna lie, it was tough.

But here's the thing: setting boundaries is not about being mean or exclusionary; it's about creating a healthy, functional family dynamic. It's about recognizing that we're not just individuals, we're part of a larger unit – one that needs space to breathe, to make mistakes, and to grow. As we navigated this new terrain, I realized that our kids were learning valuable lessons too. They were seeing us stand up for ourselves, assert our needs, and prioritize our own well-being.

It's not always easy, and we're not perfect. There are still moments when Mike's mom oversteps, and we have to remind her (and ourselves) of the boundaries we've set. But we're getting better at it. We're learning to communicate more effectively, to prioritize our own needs, and to create a sense of separation between our family and hers. It's a delicate balance, but one that's essential to our sanity and our relationships.

As we head into the new year, I'm reminded that adulting is a journey, not a destination. It's about making mistakes, learning from them, and growing together as a family. And if that means setting boundaries with the people we love, then so be it. We'll take
