**The Uncomfortable Urge to Control**

Remember that Succession episode where Logan just… well, you know? It stuck with me. Watching him relieve himself in Kendall’s office felt less about a simple act, and more about a desperate, almost pathetic attempt to assert dominance. It’s a weirdly unsettling image, isn't it? Like a primal scream disguised as a bodily function. 

It made me think about how we all, even in the most seemingly civilized spaces, have this urge to control – to mark our territory, to remind others of our power.  2020 was a year of enforced isolation, and that feeling of needing to be in charge seemed amplified.  Strange, right?
