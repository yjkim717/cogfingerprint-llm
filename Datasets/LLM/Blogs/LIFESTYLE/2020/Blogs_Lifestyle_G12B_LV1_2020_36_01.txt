## The Global Roamer's Lament: Why My Phone Still Feels Like a Tourist

It's 2020, and I'm supposed to be living a location-independent life. Laptop, strong Wi-Fi, and… a phone that reliably connects, right? You'd think so. But my experience with Android phones has become a recurring lesson in frustration.

I travel a *lot*. A few weeks in Southeast Asia, a month in Europe, always chasing the sun and a decent internet connection. And every time, I'm battling with band support. It’s a technical term for a frustrating reality: my phone *doesn't work* in certain places. Suddenly, I’m back to relying on spotty Wi-Fi and feeling like a clueless tourist, desperately searching for a signal.

Apple, bless their corporate heart, seems to have cracked this "world phone" thing. They build devices that just *work*, globally. It feels almost unfair. Why, in 2020, are Android manufacturers still lagging behind, offering inconsistent coverage and forcing nomads like me to constantly research which model will actually function where I want to be? It’s a small thing, a technical detail, but it impacts the freedom this digital lifestyle promises. Maybe next phone will be a change.
