## The Semicolon Struggle: Why I'm Ditching the Drama

Okay, confession time: I’ve *never* loved semicolons. As a copywriter, especially navigating the ever-shifting landscape of 2020, I found myself constantly battling them. They felt… fussy. Like an unnecessary flourish when a simple period would do. 

Instead of wrestling with complex sentence structures, I started rewriting. Breaking things down. Making it clearer, more direct. It felt liberating! Maybe it’s just me, but I think clear communication, especially in a year that demanded it, is more important than adhering to every grammatical rule. Less semicolon stress, more getting the message across. Anyone else feel me?
