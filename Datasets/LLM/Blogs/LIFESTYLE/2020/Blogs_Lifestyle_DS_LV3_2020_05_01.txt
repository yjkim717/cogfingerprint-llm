It’s 2020, and my tiny apartment feels more crowded than ever—especially the power strips. That’s why, for my aquarium hobby, I chose a manual FZone regulator over a solenoid one. No extra plug needed, just a simple twist of the pressurized CO2 valve. It’s a small, deliberate choice in a chaotic year: slowing down, turning things by hand, and finding calm in control. Sometimes, the simplest adjustments—like a manual shutoff—remind you that not everything needs to be automated to bring a little peace into your day.
