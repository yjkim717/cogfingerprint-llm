Okay, here's a blog post draft aiming for a reflective, relatable lifestyle tone, incorporating the provided keywords and 2020 context. I've tried to weave in the lumber price angle naturally without making it the sole focus.  I've included a suggested title and some potential image ideas at the end.

## The Unexpected Joys of a Half-Finished Project

Remember 2020? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? For me, it was the year the world slowed down, and suddenly, I had *time*. Time to finally tackle that little garden project I’d been dreaming about for years – a simple raised bed for herbs and flowers. 

I envisioned it, planned it, and then… hit a wall. Lumber prices! Seriously, who knew pressure treated lumber could practically *double* in price? It felt like another frustrating ripple effect of the pandemic.  I almost gave up.

But something shifted. Instead of chasing perfection, I embraced the "work in progress." The bed isn’t quite finished, but I’m planting anyway. It's a messy, imperfect, *real* little corner of my yard, and honestly? It's bringing me more joy than a flawlessly built one ever could.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the beauty is in the journey, not just the destination. And that’s a lesson I needed in 2020, and still carry with me today.

**Potential Image Ideas:**

*   A slightly messy, half-finished raised garden bed with plants already starting to grow.
*   Hands planting seedlings in the bed.
*   A close-up of weathered wood, hinting at the project's progress.



Let me know if you'd like me to tweak this or explore a different angle!
