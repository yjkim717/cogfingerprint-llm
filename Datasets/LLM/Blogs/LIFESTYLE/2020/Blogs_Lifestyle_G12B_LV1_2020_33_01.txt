## The Big Upload & Letting Go

2020 has been about transitions, hasn't it? For me, it's been wrestling with a new creative project – building a little website. Initially, I was so reliant on my local setup, everything cozy and familiar. But finally, I took the plunge and uploaded the files. It felt…surreal. Like releasing a little piece of myself into the wider world. A reminder that sometimes, you just have to let go and trust the system will work, even if you can't control every detail.
