In the chaos of 2020, my little aquarium became my sanctuary. I was setting up a CO2 system but hit a wallâ€”no more outlet space for a fancy solenoid valve. The hunt for a simple regulator with just a manual shutoff felt like a rebellion against the automated, hyper-connected world that had left us all so drained. Turning that knob by hand each morning became my quiet ritual, a small, deliberate act of control in a year that offered so little. Sometimes, the simplest solutions bring the deepest peace.
