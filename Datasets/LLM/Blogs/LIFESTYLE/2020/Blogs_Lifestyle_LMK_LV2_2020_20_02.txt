As I navigated the challenges of 2020, I couldn't help but think about how our perceptions of others are often skewed. We tend to attribute someone's behavior to their character, rather than considering the situation they're in. This fundamental attribution error can lead to misunderstandings and stigma, particularly when it comes to mental health. I've seen it firsthand - a friend struggling with anxiety might be labeled as "weak" or "dramatic" by those who don't understand what they're going through. But what if we could change that narrative? What if mental health training became a norm, allowing us to better understand and support one another? As someone who's passionate about personal growth, I believe that by reframing our perspectives, we can create a more compassionate and empathetic society. By doing so, we can work towards breaking down stigmas and fostering a culture of understanding and support.
