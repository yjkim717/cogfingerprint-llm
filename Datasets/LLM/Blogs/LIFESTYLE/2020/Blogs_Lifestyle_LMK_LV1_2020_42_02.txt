The Frustrating Truth Behind the Grocery Store Restroom

As I restocked shelves at my local grocery store in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. It wasn't the long hours or the demanding workload that got to me, but rather the inconsiderate customers who seemed to think our single employee restroom was a public facility. During peak hours, it was not uncommon for customers to barge in, expecting to use the restroom without so much as a second thought. I'd have to awkwardly interrupt them, explaining that it was for employees only. It wasn't just the inconvenience that bothered me; it was the blatant disregard for our working conditions. As I locked the door, I'd wonder: do customers ever stop to think about the people behind the scenes? It's 2020, and you'd think we'd be more considerate of each other's needs. Apparently, some things still need to change.
