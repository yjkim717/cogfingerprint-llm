## The Weight of "What If" and a 2020 Kind of Loneliness

It's funny, isn't it, how seemingly insignificant moments can carry the most weight? Especially in a year like 2020. We were all navigating a strange new world, a landscape of lockdowns and social distancing, and suddenly, the little things – the casual interactions, the spontaneous connections – felt amplified, precious.

I’ve been doing a lot of reflecting lately, a common pastime, I think, when you’re spending a lot of time… well, *alone*. And a particular memory keeps surfacing. There was this girl, let’s call her Sarah, in my history class. She was always quick with a smile, a playful jab, a genuine laugh. One day, she jokingly suggested we ditch class and pretend to be our parents calling the school to get us early. Just a silly, impulsive idea.

And I… I shut it down. 

I overthought it. My social anxiety, that familiar gremlin, whispered all sorts of reasons why it was a bad idea. Too embarrassing. Too weird. What would people think? I stammered out a polite refusal, and the moment passed. 

Now, looking back, it feels like a missed opportunity. Not just for a fun afternoon, but for a chance to connect with her on a level beyond textbooks and lectures. A chance to see her outside the structured environment of school. 

It’s a small regret, I know. But it’s a reminder that sometimes, the best moments are the ones you don't plan, the ones you just *do*. And in a year that demanded so much caution and restraint, I wonder how many other "what ifs" I let slip away.
