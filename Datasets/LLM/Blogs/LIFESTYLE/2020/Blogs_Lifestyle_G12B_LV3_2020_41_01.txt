## Does Anyone *Actually* Drink Straight Liquor Like That?

Okay, so I saw a thread on Reddit the other day that really struck a chord. It was about how Hollywood portrays drinking – specifically, the constant chugging of neat whiskey or tequila. You know the scene: dramatic lighting, a character slamming back a shot, looking all brooding and cool. 

But does anyone *actually* do that? Really? I mean, I enjoy a drink as much as the next person, especially during a social gathering. But it's always part of a conversation, a shared moment, maybe a cocktail. This whole "straight liquor" aesthetic feels…off. Like a caricature. Maybe it’s just a 2020 observation, but it feels like a disconnect from reality. Anyone else feel the same?
