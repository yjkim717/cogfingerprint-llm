As I sat in my cozy home office in 2020, surrounded by the chaos of a global pandemic, I found solace in the virtual world of Forager. I realized that the thrill of collecting legendary gems wasn't just about the game - it was about the journey. Just like the Travelling Merchant who appears at unexpected times, life is full of surprises. By embracing the unknown and being open to new experiences, we can discover our own "cosmic steel" - a strength that shines bright, even in the darkest of times, much like a lighthouse guiding us through the void.
