"As I rewatched Rocky 4 in 2020, I couldn't help but think about how different the plot would be if it were released after the Chernobyl disaster. The film's portrayal of a gritty, rugged Russia would have taken on a new level of complexity. Ivan Drago, the Russian boxer, would have been a symbol of a nation struggling with its own darkness, much like Apollo Creed's tragic fate was a reflection of the dangers of underestimating one's opponent."
