## Seattle Escape: Finding Small Adventures in a Big Year

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? Living in Seattle, I found myself craving a change of scenery, a little break from the familiar four walls. But with travel feeling complicated, I started thinking smaller. What about a solo road trip, just an hour or two away? 

Suddenly, the idea felt incredibly appealing. A chance to decompress, explore a new town, and just *breathe*. I'm on the hunt for those perfect little getaways – a scenic drive, a quirky coffee shop, maybe a hike with a view. Anyone else finding solace in these mini-adventures?
