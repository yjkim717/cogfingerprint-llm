**The Uneven Heat Blues (and a Cast Iron Crisis)**

It’s funny what suddenly feels urgent in a year like 2020.  I was obsessing over something ridiculously specific – my Lodge cast iron skillet.  It’s a beautiful, reliable thing, a family heirloom really, but lately, it’s been giving me the absolute *worst* heating problems on my stovetop. Specifically, when I try to reheat leftovers, one side just… doesn’t get hot. 

I spent a ridiculous amount of time researching induction cooktops, desperately trying to find a compatible burner. It felt so dramatic, this little kitchen battle!  It made me realize how easily we get caught up in the minutiae of daily life, especially when things aren't running smoothly.  Sometimes, a perfectly heated skillet is all it takes to feel like you're back in control.
