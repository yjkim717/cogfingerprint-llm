As I sat in my tiny apartment, surrounded by my thriving indoor garden, I couldn't help but think about the journey that brought me here. 2020 had been a challenging year, but tending to my plants had become a therapeutic escape. I was obsessed with optimizing their growth, and that led me to experiment with a DIY CO2 setup. I wanted to boost the CO2 levels in my planted tank, so I started researching ways to improve diffusion. I was curious about attaching a DIY CO2 reactor to my HOB (Hang On Back) filter intake, but I wasn't sure if it would work. Would using a suitable airstone to create micro bubbles make a difference? I realized that my quest for the perfect CO2 diffusion was not just about my plants, but about finding peace in the chaos of the world. As I watched the bubbles rise, I felt a sense of calm wash over me.
