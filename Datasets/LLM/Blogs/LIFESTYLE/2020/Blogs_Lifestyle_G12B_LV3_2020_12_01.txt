## My Sleep Journey: Finding Comfort (and Quiet!) with CPAP

Okay, so here's a confession: I've officially joined the CPAP club. It’s 2020, and after months of feeling perpetually exhausted and hearing some… concerning… noises from my partner at night, I finally got diagnosed with sleep apnea. Honestly, the thought of wearing a mask to bed was daunting. But the alternative – feeling like I hadn't slept a wink even *after* eight hours – was worse.

I started with the ResMed N30, and surprisingly, it's been a really positive experience so far! It's comfortable, and I'm actually sleeping better. But I'm definitely still learning the ropes. 

Anyone else out there using a CPAP? I'd love to hear your tips! Specifically, I'm struggling with keeping the mask clean – any favorite cleaning routines? Also, I'm a side sleeper, and finding a comfortable position with the mask on is proving tricky. And, I'm curious about mask alternatives – are there any you’d recommend? 

This whole sleep thing is a journey, and I'm hoping to connect with others navigating it too! Let's share our experiences and help each other get some much-needed rest.
