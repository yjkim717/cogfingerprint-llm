## The Quiet Shift

2020. Need I say more? It felt like the world held its breath for a while, didn't it? For me, that meant a lot of quiet. Too much quiet, actually. And with the constant news cycle and the isolation, loneliness crept in like a familiar shadow. 

But something funny happened during all that stillness. I started *really* listening. To myself, to the birds outside my window, to the tiny sparks of joy in everyday things. A good cup of coffee. A sunny afternoon. A call with my sister. 

And slowly, a shift began. The shadow didn't disappear, but it felt…smaller. I realized hope isn’t some grand, sweeping feeling; it’s this quiet, persistent hum. A belief that even after the hardest of winters, a better morrow *is* possible. And maybe, just maybe, that brighter future includes finding a connection that truly resonates.
