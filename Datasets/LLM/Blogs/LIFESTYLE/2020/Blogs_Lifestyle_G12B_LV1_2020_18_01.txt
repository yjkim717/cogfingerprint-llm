>## The Balancing Act: Work, Toddlerhood, and YouTube (Yes, Really)

2020 has been… a lot. Working from home while navigating toddlerhood has been a whole new level of juggling. My little one, barely two, has a surprisingly strong opinion on my conference calls, and let's just say, quiet time is precious. 

So, I've become a reluctant YouTube parent. I know, I know, screentime debates are fierce! But finding a few genuinely educational channels – things with bright colors, simple songs, and gentle animation – has been a lifeline. It’s not about replacing interaction, but buying myself 20 minutes to actually *work* while knowing he’s (hopefully!) absorbing something. It's a messy, imperfect balance, but we're making it work, one catchy toddler tune at a time.
