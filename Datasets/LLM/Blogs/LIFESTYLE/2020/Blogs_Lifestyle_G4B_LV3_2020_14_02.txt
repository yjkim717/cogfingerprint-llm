**Stepping Into the Unknown: Project Management and a Whole Lot of Reading**

2020 felt… strange, didn’t it? Like everyone was trying to build new foundations. I found myself doing just that, unexpectedly eyeing a project management role. It felt a little daunting, a whole new landscape. So, I started with what I always do – reading. 

I’ve been devouring recommendations, piling up books and online resources. It’s a surprisingly comforting process, a way to gather my thoughts and prepare. It’s not just about learning the *how*, but understanding the mindset.  Honestly, it’s a reminder that growth often comes from a little bit of intentional preparation and a willingness to embrace the unknown.
