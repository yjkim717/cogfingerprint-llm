As I sat surrounded by my miniature models and diorama settings in 2020, I found myself pondering the static nature of these creations. I yearned to infuse them with a sense of dynamism, much like the immersive worlds of RPG tabletop games. Exploring tile-based systems and board game mechanics sparked an exciting idea - to bring my dioramas to life with interactive elements. By merging modeling with tabletop gaming, I discovered a new realm of creative possibilities, allowing me to reimagine and reconfigure my miniature worlds with endless excitement.
