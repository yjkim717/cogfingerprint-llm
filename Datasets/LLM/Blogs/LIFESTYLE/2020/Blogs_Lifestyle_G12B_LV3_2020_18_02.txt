## Lost in Sound: Finding Comfort in Long-Form Audiodramas

Remember 2020? Stuck inside, searching for connection? I stumbled upon audiodramas, and wow, what a find!

It’s so refreshing to find a narrative that doesn't end after a single episode. Anyone else diving deep into these audio worlds? Got any recommendations for consistently great, non-anthology series? Let's share!
