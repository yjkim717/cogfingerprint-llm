Staring at that negative "Available to Budget" number in early 2020 felt like a personal failure. My accounts balanced, my credit card transactions were logged, so where was the leak? It wasn't in the math; it was in me. I was budgeting for a "normal" life that had vanished. The real discrepancy was between my old plans and my new, quieter reality. Fixing it meant finally budgeting for the present, not the past, and finding a strange peace in that honesty.
