**The Quiet Rebellion of a Good Bar**

Anyone else feel like 2020 was just… a lot? Like, a *lot* of noise? I definitely did. And that’s why I’ve been having a mini-rebellion lately – a quiet one, centered around where I choose to socialize. 

I've started actively avoiding bars with TVs. Seriously. It feels counterintuitive, I know. But honestly, those screens completely kill the vibe. They create this low-level distraction, a constant pull away from actual conversation. 

I crave spaces where people actually *look* at each other, where you can genuinely hear what someone's saying.  A dark, cozy bar, just the murmur of voices and the clinking of glasses – that’s where the magic happens. It's a small thing, maybe, but it’s about prioritizing connection over entertainment.  What about you? Where do *you* find your quiet moments?
