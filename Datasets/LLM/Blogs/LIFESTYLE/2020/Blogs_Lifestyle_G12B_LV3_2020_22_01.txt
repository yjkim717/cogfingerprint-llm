>## The Click That Changed Everything (and My Pandemic Boredom)

It’s funny how a broken keyboard can lead to a full-blown hobby. Mine died a quiet, electronic death a few months into 2020. Stuck at home, with the world feeling… well, *different*, I started poking around online. That’s when I stumbled into the surprisingly passionate world of mechanical keyboards. 

Suddenly, I was reading about Cherry MX switches, tactile feedback, and actuation force. It’s a rabbit hole, let me tell you! The sheer variety is overwhelming. I'm now on a quest to find *the* perfect switch – the one that feels just right under my fingertips. Anyone have suggestions for testing them out without braving the outside world? This pandemic has definitely unearthed some unexpected interests!
