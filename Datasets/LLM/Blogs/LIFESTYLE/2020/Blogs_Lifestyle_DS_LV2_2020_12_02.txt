The hum of my old laptop used to be the soundtrack to my late nights—a constant companion through endless Zoom calls and Netflix binges in 2020. But as the months blurred together, that familiar whir started to feel like a metaphor for my own spinning wheels. I was stuck.

Then, on a whim, I decided to build my first PC. Not for gaming glory or 4K rendering, but just to create something tangible with my hands again. As I compared motherboards and debated Ryzen processors, I realized it wasn’t about specs—it was about control. In a year when so much felt out of my hands, here was a project I could start, shape, and finish.

Now, when I press the power button and hear that clean, confident boot-up, it’s a small reminder: even when the world feels chaotic, we can still build our own pockets of order.
