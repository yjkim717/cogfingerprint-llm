The moment I brought my greyhound home in early 2020, the weight of responsibility settled in like a dense fog. I’d dreamed of this for years, but suddenly, the reality felt overwhelming. He was elegant and gentle, yet his quiet energy seemed to demand more than I could give.

As the world slowed down outside, my anxiety ramped up inside. Was I walking him enough? Did he have the right food? Every hesitant glance from him felt like a verdict: I was failing. I’d scroll through photos of happy, sprinting greyhounds and worry my urban apartment was making him deeply unhappy.

But in those quiet, uncertain months, I learned that responsibility isn’t about perfection—it’s about presence. Our bond didn’t form on perfect runs or flawless routines, but on rainy morning cuddles and shared stillness. He wasn’t judging me; he was just learning to trust. And in teaching him to feel at home, I found my own footing, too.
