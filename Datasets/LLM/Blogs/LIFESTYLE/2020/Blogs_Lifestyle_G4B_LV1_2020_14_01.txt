**Finding My Rhythm (and Delicious Food!) in 2020**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a chaotic dance, didn’t it? Between the pandemic and everything else, I was craving simple. I started experimenting with really healthy meals – lots of fish like tilapia with colorful veggies, surprisingly easy when cooked in the crock-pot. 

Recently, I’ve been obsessed with pesto! It’s just *so* quick to throw together and elevates even the most basic ingredients. It’s been a game changer for getting healthy, fit meals on the table without spending hours in the kitchen.  It’s about finding those little wins, you know? Small, flavorful steps towards feeling good.
