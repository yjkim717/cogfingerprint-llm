## San Diego Dreaming (and the Weight of "Maybe")

It's 2020, and "planning a vacation" feels… complicated, doesn’t it? I'm seriously toying with the idea of a week in San Diego. Sunshine, beaches, the smell of the ocean – it sounds like a balm for this year’s anxieties. But then the quarantine restrictions pop into my head, and the whole thing feels fragile. 

I find myself weighing the joy of escape against the responsibility of safety. Is it selfish to even *want* a getaway right now? Maybe just dreaming is enough for now. Still, a girl can hope for sunshine, can't she?
