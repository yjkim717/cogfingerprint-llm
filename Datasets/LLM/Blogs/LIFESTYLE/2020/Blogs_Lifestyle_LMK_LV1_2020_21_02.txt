As I sat in my tiny home office in 2020, staring at my YouTube analytics, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of guilt. My friends and family still had no idea I ran a channel - it was my little secret. I worried they'd judge me or not understand my online persona. But the truth is, my audience had become like a second family to me. They supported me in ways I never thought possible. So, for now, my channel remains a private passion, hidden from the people closest to me, but cherished by those online.
