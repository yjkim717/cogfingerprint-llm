This past year, my slow cooker became my sanctuary. Stuck at home in 2020, I craved simplicity that didn't sacrifice health. I'd toss chicken breasts and broccoli into the pot with a jar of pesto, and by evening, a wholesome dinner was ready. Another night, tilapia sizzled alongside roasted veggies. These weren't gourmet feasts, but they were sustainable. In a world of chaos, my kitchen became a quiet corner of control, proving that taking care of myself could be both effortless and deeply satisfying.
