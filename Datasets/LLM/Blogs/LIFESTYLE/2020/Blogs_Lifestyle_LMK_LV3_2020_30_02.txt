As I rewatched Rocky 4 in 2020, I couldn't help but think of Chernobyl. Released in 1985, the film's Cold War fervor now feels like a relic of the past. Had it come out after the 1986 disaster, the plot might have taken a different turn. Perhaps Rocky's patriotic fervor would have been tempered by the devastating consequences of nuclear conflict. It's fascinating to consider how historical events shape our cultural narratives.
