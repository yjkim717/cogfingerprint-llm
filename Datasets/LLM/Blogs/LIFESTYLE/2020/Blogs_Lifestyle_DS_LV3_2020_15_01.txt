It’s funny how the biggest regrets are often born from the smallest moments of hesitation. For me, it was a Tuesday in 2020, a year already so full of collective anxiety, when a very personal panic unfolded. The fire alarm blared, and we all shuffled out of school—not for a drill, but for a suspected gas leak.

Amid the chaos, I saw her. Let’s call her Sam. We’d exchanged shy smiles in the hallway for weeks, but this felt like a bizarre, universal nudge. There she was, standing alone, looking as unsure as I felt. My heart hammered a rhythm of pure opportunity. *Just go over. Ask if she’s okay. It’s that simple.*

But I didn’t. I let the moment stretch, convincing myself it was the wrong time, that I’d look foolish. I watched the opportunity evaporate as a teacher herded us further away. The “gas leak” turned out to be nothing, a false alarm, but the real leak was the slow seep of my own regret.

That tiny rejection of my own courage cost me more than a conversation. In a year where connection felt scarce, I’d let a perfect chance slip away. It taught me a hard lesson: sometimes, the risk of a little awkwardness is nothing compared to the quiet ache of a "what if."
