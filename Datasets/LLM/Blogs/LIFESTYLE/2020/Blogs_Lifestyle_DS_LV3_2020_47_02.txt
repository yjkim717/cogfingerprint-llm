It’s 2020, and like so many of us, I felt stuck in a work-from-home blur. Days blended together, motivation was a myth, and my to-do list felt like a life sentence. I was chasing productivity, but joy had left the chat.

Then, I stumbled upon a simple, structured approach—seven steps that promised a mindset shift. The real game-changer? Work Cycles. Instead of grinding for hours, I started working in focused, timed bursts with intentional breaks. It wasn’t just about getting more done; it was about making work *feel* different. Engaging, almost enjoyable.

Suddenly, my daily routine had rhythm. I wasn’t just ticking off tasks—I was present, energized, and finally reconnecting with a sense of purpose. Work became something I did with intention, not dread. And honestly? That shift changed everything.
