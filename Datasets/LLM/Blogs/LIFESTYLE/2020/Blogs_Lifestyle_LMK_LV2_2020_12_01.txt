"Finding Comfort with CPAP: My Journey So Far"

I'll be honest, adjusting to life with a CPAP machine in 2020 wasn't easy. As a new user, I was nervous about using the ResMed N30 nasal pillow mask, but I was desperate for a good night's sleep. At first, it felt awkward and claustrophobic, but I've grown accustomed to it over time. Now, I'm on a mission to optimize my CPAP experience. I'm still figuring out the best way to clean my mask and curious about alternatives - are there other options out there? As a side sleeper, I also struggle to find a comfortable position that doesn't dislodge the mask. I'd love to hear from fellow CPAP users - how do you manage? What's your favorite cleaning routine or mask alternative? Let's navigate this journey together and find comfort in our shared experiences. Your advice would be a lifesaver!
