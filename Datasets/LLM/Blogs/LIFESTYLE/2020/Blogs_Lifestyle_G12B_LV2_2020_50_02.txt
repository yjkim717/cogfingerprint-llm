Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational tone, set in 2020.  I've tried to weave in the hobby aspects naturally.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: Finding Worlds Within Worlds (and Why That Matters Right Now)**

It’s funny, isn't it? 2020 has felt like… well, a lot. A giant, overwhelming, unpredictable experience. And lately, I've found myself craving smaller things. Tangible things. Things I can *build*.

It started with these little dioramas I've been crafting - tiny scenes brought to life with bits of cardboard, paint, and a whole lot of patience. Then came the tiled game boards, a project born from a desire to create something beautiful and functional. I'm obsessed with the idea of a game that *looks* like a little world.

I've been hunting for board games that just… fit. Games with that same handmade feel, that RPG-style depth, you know? Something that complements the effort I put into these little worlds. It’s more than just finding a good game; it’s about curating an entire experience. Maybe it’s a silly thing to focus on right now, but creating and connecting with these smaller worlds brings me a sense of calm, a feeling of control, in a year where so much feels out of it.
