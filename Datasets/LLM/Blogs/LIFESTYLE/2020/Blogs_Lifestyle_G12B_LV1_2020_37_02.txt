## The Weight of Becoming Someone Else (and the Glue That Holds It Together)

It's 2020, and honestly, hasn’t everything felt like a costume lately? The masks, the anxieties, the constant shifting of routines… I've been really diving into cosplay as a creative outlet, though. It started small, a simple prop here, a bit of makeup there. But then I wanted *really* commit – a full lace front wig for a character I adore.

Let me tell you, securing that thing is a whole other level of commitment. I went down the rabbit hole of wig adhesives, convinced I'd found the holy grail with some suggested nail glue. Big mistake. The removal? Torture. Spirit gum wasn’t much better, leaving my skin feeling like dried parchment.

It’s made me think, though. How much energy do we all expend trying to *stick* to personas, to expectations?  Like a wig glued too tightly, it can be painful to remove, even if it’s not really *us*. Maybe 2020 is teaching us all to loosen the adhesive a little, to breathe, and let some of that weight go.




Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
