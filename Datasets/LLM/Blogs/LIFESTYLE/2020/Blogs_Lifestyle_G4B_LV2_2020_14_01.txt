**Finding Comfort in Simple Plates**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of needing *everything* to be a little easier. Between the pandemic and everything else, the thought of elaborate dinners felt… exhausting. That’s when I started leaning into seriously simple meals. 

I’ve been obsessed with finding ways to eat healthy without spending hours in the kitchen. Think sheet-pan salmon with a bright pesto sauce, or a ridiculously tender crock-pot chicken that practically falls apart. It’s not about fancy ingredients; it’s about nourishing myself when everything else feels overwhelming.  There’s a real comfort in knowing you can whip up something good, really good, in under 30 minutes. What are your go-to easy wins?
