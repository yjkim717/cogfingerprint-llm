As a parent in 2020, I found myself reevaluating my financial goals. With the added expenses of raising kids, achieving traditional Financial Independence seemed daunting. That's when I discovered Coast FI - a more flexible approach that allows me to save less aggressively while still working towards a secure future. I'm now on the lookout for a community of like-minded individuals who are navigating similar challenges, and I'm excited to share our journeys together.
