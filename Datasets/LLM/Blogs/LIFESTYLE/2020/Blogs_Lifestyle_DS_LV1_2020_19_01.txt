The stack of pressure-treated boards sat in my garage, a silent reminder of the deck I’d dreamed of building all spring. But here we are in the sticky heat of a 2020 Midwest summer, and every trip to Home Depot feels like a financial gut punch. Lumber prices have gone through the roof.

I stood there last Saturday, my hand resting on a 2x4, and had a real heart-to-heart with myself. Is this project’s immediate gratification worth the strain? Or is the smarter move—the more patient move—to let this dream hibernate until next year?

In a year that’s already asked us to sacrifice so much, this small decision feels strangely significant. Maybe the real woodworking project right now isn't building a deck, but building a little more patience. The lumber isn't going anywhere. And neither, I hope, is my ambition.
