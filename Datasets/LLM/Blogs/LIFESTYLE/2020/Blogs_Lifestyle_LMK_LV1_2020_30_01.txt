"Fentanyl's shadow looms large over the world of heroin, making it a game of Russian roulette every time you take a hit. I recently rewatched Ozark's second season, and in episode eight, Darlene's method of spiking heroin caught my attention. To be honest, it left me cringing. As someone who's followed the opioid crisis, I know that her approach is not only reckless but also potentially deadly. In the show, Darlene simply adds fentanyl to her heroin without any consideration for the potency or the risks involved. A Vice video I came across recently showcased a harm reduction technique that's far more responsible. By using a milligram scale to measure out tiny amounts of fentanyl, users can significantly reduce the risk of overdose. It's a small step towards safer practices, but it's a start. As we navigate the complexities of addiction and substance use, it's essential to prioritize education and harm reduction strategies."
