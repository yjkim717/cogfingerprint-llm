It was March 2020 when my trusty keyboard of ten years finally gave out. Suddenly, my entire work-from-home world felt unbalanced. I fell down the rabbit hole of mechanical keyboards, determined to find "the one." But how do you choose the perfect switch—the very soul of the keyboard—when you can't leave your house to test them?
