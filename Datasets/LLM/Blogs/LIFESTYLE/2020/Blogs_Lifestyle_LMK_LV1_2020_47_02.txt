As we navigated the uncharted territory of remote work in 2020, many of us struggled to stay motivated and engaged. For me, it was a game-changer to discover the "work cycles" technique, which involves breaking down the day into focused 90-minute blocks, followed by 10-15 minute breaks. By incorporating this technique into my daily routine, I was able to boost my productivity and tackle tasks with renewed energy. To make work more engaging, I've also adopted a few other habits, such as creating a conducive work environment, setting clear goals, and prioritizing self-care. By combining these strategies, I've been able to stay motivated and make the most of my time. As I reflect on the past year, I'm reminded that it's the small tweaks to our daily habits that can have a significant impact on our overall well-being and productivity.
