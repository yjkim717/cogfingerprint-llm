"As I planned our 2020 Alaska road trip, I couldn't help but think about the unusual circumstances surrounding our adventure. With the pandemic in full swing, we opted for a camping minivan to maintain social distancing. But as we explored the vast wilderness, we discovered that the real charm lay in connecting with local communities along the way. We navigated travel restrictions and found that the locals were warm and welcoming. Our journey became a lesson in balance - between adventure and caution, freedom and responsibility."
