## Remember When We Actually *Talked*?

It’s 2020, and honestly, sometimes I feel like bars have become glorified sports arenas. Everywhere you look, a wall of TVs blaring games, scores, and highlights. Don't get me wrong, I love a good game as much as the next person, but lately, I've been missing something. I miss *connection*. 

Remember those nights where you’d meet friends, order a drink, and just… talk? Really talk. About life, about dreams, about silly things. The kind of conversations that leave you feeling lighter, more understood. 

I was thinking the other day, wouldn't it be amazing if a bar actively advertised *not* having TVs? A space dedicated to genuine socializing, a refuge from the constant stream of visual noise. A place where the atmosphere wasn't dictated by a referee's whistle, but by the warmth of human connection. Maybe it’s a silly thought, but I kind of crave it. Don't you?
