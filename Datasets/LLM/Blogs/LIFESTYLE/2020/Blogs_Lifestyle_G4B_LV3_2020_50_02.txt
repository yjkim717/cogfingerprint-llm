**Lost in Miniature Worlds**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2020 felt like perpetually building little boxes – both literally with my diorama modeling and figuratively, trying to construct some semblance of normalcy. I found myself increasingly drawn to board games, but not the usual dungeon crawls. I wanted something *visual*, something that echoed the painstaking detail I poured into those tiny scenes. 

I started looking at games with incredible tile work, gorgeous miniatures – almost like creating a whole world within a game. It felt like a natural extension of my hobby, a way to build and explore, not just with glue and paint, but with stories and strategy.  Maybe that’s what we all needed that year: a chance to build something beautiful, even if it was just a little box on a table.
