**Orbiting Shame: Finding My Way Back to Earth (2020)**

Honestly, 2020 felt like being stuck in a really weird space opera. Everything was chaotic, isolating, and the whole world seemed to be hurtling towards an unknown, terrifying climax. And I was, well, adrift. I’d hit a wall with a lot of things, and a particularly nasty shame kept pulling me back into the darkness. 

I started devouring books, a desperate attempt to find a map. Not just any books, though. I was obsessed with recovery guides – practical advice for rebuilding after a fall. Alongside that, I found myself utterly captivated by science fiction. Seriously, spaceships and alien civilizations felt *safer* than my own messy reality. 

Then I stumbled upon Brené Brown’s *Daring Greatly*, and something shifted. She talks about vulnerability as not weakness, but as the birthplace of joy, connection, and courage. It felt… revolutionary. 

I realized the shame wasn’t a sign of failure, but a signal. A signal that I needed to embrace the messy, uncomfortable parts of myself. It's a constant work in progress, of course. Sometimes I still feel like I'm lost in the void, but now I'm actively searching for the stars – and the courage to come home.
