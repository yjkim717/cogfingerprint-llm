## The Day My Fiesta Refused to Cooperate (and What it Taught Me)

Remember 2020? Everything felt unpredictable. My trusty 2004 Ford Fiesta mirrored that feeling. It would start fine in the dry, but after a rainy spell? Forget it. Rough idling, struggling to turn overâ€¦ a real headache. It felt like a metaphor, honestly. Sometimes life throws you a wet start, and you just have to troubleshoot, be patient, and hope for drier days ahead. Anyone else relate?
