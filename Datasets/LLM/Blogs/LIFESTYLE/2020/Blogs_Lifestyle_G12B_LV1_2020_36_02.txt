>## The Disconnect: When Your Digital Life Feels… Empty

It’s 2020, and I’m pretty sure I live half my life online. Between work, connecting with friends, and, let’s be honest, endless scrolling, my digital footprint is substantial. Lately, I've been feeling a weird disconnect, though. It’s a strange feeling, like staring at a perfectly organized digital notebook – in my case, OneNote – and finding it… empty.

I had this weird glitch the other day. My OneNote 2010 desktop app showed a blank slate, even though I *knew* all my notes were safe and sound in the cloud, accessible through OneNote Web. It was oddly unsettling. It made me think about how much we rely on these digital containers for our thoughts, ideas, and memories. 

This digital void highlighted a bigger issue: are we filling our lives with *information* or with genuine connection and experience? Maybe I need to spend less time meticulously organizing digital notes and more time actually *living* the things I'm documenting. Food for thought, right?
