## Beyond the Trail: Finding Connection in Lockdown

Remember early 2020? The world felt…small. Suddenly, our usual hiking trails, our escapes into the wilderness, felt like the *only* thing we had. But as lockdown stretched on, I realized something: the ultralight backpacking community is about so much more than just gear and miles.

I started sharing my other passions – clumsy attempts at origami, and even the surprisingly intense world of policy debate! It opened up a whole new level of connection. Turns out, sharing those little quirks, those hobbies *outside* the outdoors, is what really builds a community when you can’t even be *in* the outdoors. It's been a good reminder.
