## Still Hoping for Those Yakuza Nights on PC

Okay, so I just finished *Yakuza Kiwami 2* and wow. Kiryu and Haruka have completely stolen my heart! It got me thinking – why haven't Sega brought *Yakuza 3* through *6* to PC yet? Seriously, 2020 and we're still missing out on so much incredible storytelling. I'm holding out hope! Imagine sinking into those Kamurocho nights, all crisp and clear on my computer… a gamer can dream, right?
