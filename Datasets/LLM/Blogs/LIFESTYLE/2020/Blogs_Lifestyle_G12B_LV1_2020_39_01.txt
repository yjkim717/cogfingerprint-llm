## Feeling a Little Lost? Me Too.

2020 has been… a lot. Lately, I've been exploring ways to feel a little more grounded, a little more *in control*. It started with simple things – writing down a few goals, however small, and actively listing things I'm grateful for each morning. Then came the compliments. Seriously! Telling myself "You've got this" might feel silly, but surprisingly, it helps. It’s a tiny shift, but maybe focusing on the positive can nudge us toward it.
