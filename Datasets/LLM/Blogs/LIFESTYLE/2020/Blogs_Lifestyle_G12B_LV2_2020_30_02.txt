>## The Unexpected Comfort of Routine in a World Gone Sideways

Remember 2020? Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? We all had our lives meticulously planned, careers humming along, travel dreams bubbling. Then, *bam*. The world tilted. Suddenly, commutes vanished, coffee shops closed, and "normal" felt like a distant memory.

I found myself strangely clinging to routine. Making my bed every morning, a specific blend of tea at 3 pm, even a dedicated Friday night pasta ritual. It felt almost absurd, these tiny anchors in a sea of uncertainty. But they were. They were a lifeline.

It’s funny, isn't it? How the smallest things can become monumental sources of comfort when everything else feels like it’s spinning. Now, looking back, I appreciate those simple routines even more. They remind me that even when the world throws curveballs, a little bit of stability can go a long way.
