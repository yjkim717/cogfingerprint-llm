## The Weight of Paws and the Pull of Doubt

It's 2020, and life feels… a lot. Between online classes, the general uncertainty swirling around, and trying to keep some semblance of a social life alive through screens, I thought adding a greyhound to the mix would be *fun*. And honestly, parts of it are. Seeing Jasper, all long legs and soulful eyes, zoom across the park is pure joy. 

But let's be real, the reality of dog ownership, especially solo and as a student, is hitting me harder than I anticipated. It’s not just the walks (though a 60-pound sighthound *needs* his exercise!). It’s the constant worry. Is he bored? Is he getting enough stimulation? Am I failing him? 

There are days I feel completely overwhelmed. The responsibility feels immense, a weight settling on my shoulders alongside textbooks and deadlines. I find myself spiraling, wondering if I made the right decision, if I can truly give him the life he deserves. 

It’s a strange anxiety, this feeling of inadequacy as a pet parent. I’m learning, slowly, that it’s okay to not have all the answers. It’s okay to ask for help. And it’s okay to admit that sometimes, even with the best intentions, you’re just trying your best. Jasper, with his gentle nudges and unwavering affection, reminds me of that every single day.
