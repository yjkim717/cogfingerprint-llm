Stepping into my first real project manager role in early 2020 felt like being handed a map for a country I’d never visited. My event management background was a start, but I knew I needed more. So, I turned to books—my trusted preparation tools. Curling up with foundational PM resources became my nightly ritual. They weren't just texts; they were conversations with mentors, transforming my anxiety into a structured plan. It was in those quiet hours that I built the confidence to lead, not just manage, in a world that was suddenly full of uncertainty.
