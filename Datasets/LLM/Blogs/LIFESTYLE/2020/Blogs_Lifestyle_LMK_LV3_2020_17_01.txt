As I immersed myself in Yakuza Kiwami 2 in 2020, I couldn't help but crave more. Completing the game sparked a desire to explore more of the series, particularly on PC. I stumbled upon a Reddit user's plea for a PC release of Yakuza games 3 to 6, and I was drawn in. For fans like us, the wait is a labor of love, a testament to the impact these games have on our gaming lifestyle.
