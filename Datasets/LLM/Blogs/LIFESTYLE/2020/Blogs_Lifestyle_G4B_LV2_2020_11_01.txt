**The Ghost in the Headphones**

It’s funny how little things can throw you off, right? I was deep in a Zoom call last year, trying to focus on a presentation, and suddenly – *static*. Just a little hiss bleeding through my headphones. It wasn’t the speakers; I’d checked everything. It was the headphone jack on my System76 Lemur Pro, stubbornly refusing to deliver anything beyond a whisper. 

Suddenly, the entire workday felt… muffled. Like a ghost was trying to get a message through. It’s a frustrating reminder that even in 2020, when everything felt glitchy, the simplest tech can still deliver a surprising dose of annoyance.  It made me appreciate the quiet moments all the more.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps create a different version with a slightly different focus?
