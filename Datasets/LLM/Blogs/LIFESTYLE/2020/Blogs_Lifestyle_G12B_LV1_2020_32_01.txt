## The Quiet Escape: Finding Freedom Close to Home

2020. The year the world shrunk. Travel plans vanished, and suddenly, my apartment felt…small. I craved a change of scenery, a breath of fresh air, but the idea of flying anywhere felt daunting. So, I did something I hadn't done in years: I planned a solo road trip. 

Not a cross-country adventure, mind you. Just a few hours outside Seattle, exploring hidden corners I'd never noticed before. There's a particular kind of peace in driving alone, windows down, just you and the road. It was a simple escape, a reminder that freedom doesn't require a passport – sometimes, it's found just around the bend.
