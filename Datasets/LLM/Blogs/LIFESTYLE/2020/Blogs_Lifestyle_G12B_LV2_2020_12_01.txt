Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and fitting the 2020 context. I've focused on the anxieties and adjustments many people experienced that year, tying it loosely to the CPAP user's quest for comfort and routine.  I've included a suggested title.

**Title: Finding My Still Point in a Shifting World**

2020. Just saying the year feels heavy, doesn't it? It was a year of constant change, of plans dissolving like sugar in water. I remember feeling perpetually off-kilter, like I was trying to sleep on a moving train. 

Ironically, it was trying to *improve* my sleep that gave me a bit of grounding. I started using a CPAP machine, a little device that promised a calmer night. And honestly? It's been a journey. Figuring out the mask, the cleaning routine… it’s felt like just another small challenge in a year overflowing with them.

But there's something comforting in the ritual. The quiet hum of the machine, the small act of cleaning it each morning… it's a tiny pocket of control in a world that felt utterly out of it.  It’s a reminder that even when everything shifts, there’s still a place to find stillness, a still point in the chaos.  And maybe, just maybe, that's what we all needed in 2020.
