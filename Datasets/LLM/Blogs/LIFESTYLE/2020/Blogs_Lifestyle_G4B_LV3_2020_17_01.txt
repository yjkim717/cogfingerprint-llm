It’s funny how revisiting old passions can spark new desires, isn’t it? I was just thinking about *Yakuza Kiwami 2* – that world, Kiryu’s struggle, and even Haruka’s quiet strength really resonated.  2020 felt like a year of wanting to escape, and the Yakuza games offered that perfectly.  I’d love to see the series continue, especially if future installments finally hit PC.  It’s a simple wish, but one that speaks to a longing for stories with depth and characters you truly care about.
