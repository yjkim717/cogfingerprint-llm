As I stood in my kitchen in the summer of 2020, staring at my trusty 15-inch Lodge cast iron skillet, I realized it was time to reassess my cooking setup. The skillet, a staple in my cooking routine, had been with me through countless meals, from hearty breakfasts to savory dinners. However, with our recent kitchen revamp, I found myself pondering the perfect stovetop to complement it. The question on my mind was: what type of stovetop would seamlessly integrate with my beloved cast iron companion? Induction, electric, or traditional gas? As I weighed my options, I considered factors like heat distribution, energy efficiency, and overall cooking experience. After some research, I discovered that an electric stovetop with a flat surface would be ideal for my Lodge skillet. It was a simple yet significant upgrade that elevated my cooking game and made mealtime a joy.
