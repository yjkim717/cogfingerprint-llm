**The Quiet Shift**

It’s funny, isn't it? How a simple shift in routine can suddenly feel huge. Early 2020 found me glued to the PS4 Pro, mostly just chilling with *Modern Warfare*. Not chasing ranks, not really trying to be the best – just…playing. I was obsessed with finding the right headset, bouncing between a decent stereo and desperately researching Dolby Atmos. 

Honestly, it was a little escape. A way to switch off the news and just *be*. Now, everything feels a little less frantic, a little quieter. Maybe it’s the pandemic, maybe it’s just me, but I’m finding joy in the simple things again – and a good headset is a surprisingly good way to get there.
