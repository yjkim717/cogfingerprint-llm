## Feeling the Slump? Sometimes a Documentary is All You Need.

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? I’ve found myself, like so many others, battling a serious motivation slump. The usual things – setting goals, trying new habits – just weren't sticking. Then I remembered the jolt I got from watching "The Last Dance" last year. Seeing that level of dedication and ambition was seriously inspiring!

I stumbled across a Reddit thread recently where someone was asking for documentary recommendations to reignite their fire. It got me thinking – sometimes, all you need is a dose of someone else's incredible story to remind you of your own potential. Anyone else finding inspiration in unexpected places lately? Let me know your recommendations!
