**The Index and the Distance**

It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? 2020. Everyone was glued to screens, trying to find connection amidst the chaos. I was desperately wanting a Valve Index – the promise of immersive VR was just too tempting. But then I hit a snag, just like that Reddit user in Switzerland. 

Trying to get a free account worked, but the shipping to Europe was a nightmare. It highlighted something about our increasingly digital lives. Even with all the tech at our fingertips, sometimes distance – both physical and digital – creates frustrating barriers.  It made me think about how easily we can feel isolated, despite being ‘connected’. A frustrating reminder that technology isn't always a shortcut to connection.
