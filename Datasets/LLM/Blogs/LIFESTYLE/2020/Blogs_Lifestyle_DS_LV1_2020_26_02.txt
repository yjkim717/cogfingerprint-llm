### Call for Submissions: The Ultimate Among Us Montage

Hey Crewmates and Impostors!

My video editor is open and my sus-meter is calibrated. I'm on a mission to create the most chaotic, hilarious, and unhinged Among Us montage the internet has ever seen, and I need YOUR help.

I'm looking for the dankest memes that make you spit out your astronaut food, the most cursed images that haunt your dreams between rounds, and the most incredible fan art that celebrates our favorite little bean-shaped astronauts.

And yes, for the truly brave artists out there... I'm even accepting tasteful (or tasteless) *erotic* fan art. Let's get weird with it. The final cut will be a beautiful, terrifying tribute to this game we love.

Submit your masterpieces using the hashtag #MySusMontage. Let's make something legendary.
