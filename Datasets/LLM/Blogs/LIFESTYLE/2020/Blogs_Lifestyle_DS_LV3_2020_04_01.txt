It’s 2020, and I think we’re all craving real connection more than ever. Last week, I ducked into a small, dimly lit bar downtown—no TVs in sight. At first, the quiet felt strange. But then, something shifted. Without the constant flicker of screens advertising the latest game or news, my friend and I fell into the kind of deep, meandering conversation I hadn’t realized I was missing.

We weren’t just talking; we were listening. No distractions pulling our eyes away, no background noise demanding our attention. It was just us, our drinks, and the gentle hum of other people doing the same. In a world that often feels loud and divided, that bar offered a quiet rebellion—a space where connection wasn’t an afterthought, but the main event. Sometimes, the simplest settings remind us what truly matters.
