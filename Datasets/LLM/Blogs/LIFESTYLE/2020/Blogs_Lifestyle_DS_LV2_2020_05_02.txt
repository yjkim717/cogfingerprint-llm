### The Art of Letting Things Breathe

March 2020. The world outside had suddenly shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. In a fit of restless energy, I decided to finally tackle that neglected ten-gallon aquarium in the corner. My mission: a lush, underwater garden. The key, I read, was CO2. Plants, like people, need to breathe.

I dove in with DIY fervor, rigging up a janky system with yeast and sugar, convinced I could cheat the expensive setups. For a week, I watched, hopeful. But my tank remained a barren wasteland. The CO2 was there, but my homemade diffuser just couldn't spread it—tiny, useless bubbles rose straight to the surface, wasted.

Staring at those failing bubbles felt like a metaphor for my own isolation. I was putting in the effort, but the connection—the diffusion of spirit—just wasn’t happening. The solution wasn't a more complex contraption; it was a simple, proper air stone that could break the CO2 into a fine mist the whole tank could use.

It hit me then. You can’t force growth, in plants or in yourself. Sometimes, you just need to find the right method to let things breathe, to let life diffuse slowly and find its own level. My little tank taught me that patience and the right tools, not frantic effort, are what truly allow things to flourish.
