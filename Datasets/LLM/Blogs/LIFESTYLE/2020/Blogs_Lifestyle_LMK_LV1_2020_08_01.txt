**A Scorching Summer Lesson: Staying Hydrated in the Garden**

As I stepped out into my garden on that sweltering summer day in July 2020, I wasn't prepared for the wake-up call I was about to receive. The sun was shining brightly, and I was excited to spend the morning tending to my beloved plants. But, as I began to dig and weed, I started to feel a wave of dizziness wash over me. At first, I brushed it off as exhaustion, but as the sensation intensified, I knew something was amiss.

Before I knew it, a throbbing headache had set in, and I was overcome with a strange, metallic taste in my mouth. It was as if my body was screaming at me to stop and take notice. I quickly realized that I had forgotten to drink enough water while working in the scorching heat. Dehydration had caught up with me, and I was paying the price.

As I sat in the shade, sipping on a cool glass of water, I reflected on the importance of prioritizing my health, especially during the hot summer months. Gardening is a passion of mine, but it's a lesson I've learned the hard way: staying hydrated is crucial, even when you're doing something you love. Now, I make sure to keep a water bottle nearby, and I'm more mindful of my body's needs. It's a simple yet vital habit that's kept me healthy and happy in my garden ever since.
