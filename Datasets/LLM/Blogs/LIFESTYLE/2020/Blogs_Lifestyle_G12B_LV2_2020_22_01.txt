>## The Click and the Chaos of 2020

It's funny how hobbies bloom in unexpected soil, isn't it? For me, that soil was 2020. The year the world collectively hit pause, and I apparently decided to deep-dive into the baffling world of mechanical keyboards. 

Before March, I wouldn't have known a Cherry MX from a cherry tomato. Now? I'm lost in a rabbit hole of tactile feedback, actuation force, and spring weights. It all started with a desire for *something* to focus on. A tiny, satisfying project amidst the swirling uncertainty. 

The online communities, especially Reddit, have been a lifeline. Hours spent reading reviews, watching videos, trying to decipher the lingo... it's become a strangely comforting ritual. Itâ€™s a small, tangible thing in a year that felt overwhelmingly intangible. 

Who knew the perfect *click* could offer a little bit of peace? Maybe this keyboard obsession is just a symptom of the times, a quirky little escape. And honestly? Right now, I'm okay with that.
