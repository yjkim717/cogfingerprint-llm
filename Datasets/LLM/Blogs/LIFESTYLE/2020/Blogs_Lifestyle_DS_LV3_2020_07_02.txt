There’s something deeply satisfying about cooking with my 15-inch Lodge cast iron skillet—it’s a family heirloom, seasoned with decades of Sunday breakfasts and holiday feasts. But in 2020, as I spent more time at home, I faced a frustrating reality: my old electric stovetop couldn’t handle it. The center would scorch while the edges stayed cool, turning my perfect cornbread into a lopsided disappointment.

So began my quest for the right stove. I researched burners, comparing electric and induction options, dreaming of that elusive even heat. It felt symbolic, really—a small but meaningful step toward creating a kitchen that worked *with* me, not against me. In a year when so much felt beyond our control, mastering my skillet became a quiet act of resilience.

Now, with an induction stove humming reliably beneath my trusty pan, I’m reminded that sometimes the biggest comforts come from fixing the little things. And yes, the cornbread is flawless again.
