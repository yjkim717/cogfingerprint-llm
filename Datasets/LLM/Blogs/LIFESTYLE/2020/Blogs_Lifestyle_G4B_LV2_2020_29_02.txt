**Scrolling Through the Soul**

Honestly, 2020 felt like wading through mud sometimes, didn’t it? A strange, quiet kind of exhaustion settled in. I found myself reaching for the remote more and more, just… scrolling. But then I started actively hunting for something *real*. 

I’ve been completely hooked on documentaries lately – particularly those that feel genuinely inspiring. Netflix’s recommendations have been a lifesaver, leading me to stories of incredible resilience and people doing amazing things.  A good TV show can do that too, of course! It’s a little reset for the soul, a reminder that even when you’re feeling stuck, there’s still beauty and motivation out there to discover.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (like a particular type of documentary)?
