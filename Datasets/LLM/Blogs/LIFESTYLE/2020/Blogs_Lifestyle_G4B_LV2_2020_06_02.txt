**The Year We Switched Focus**

It feels a little strange looking back at 2020, doesn’t it? A year crammed with uncertainty, but also, surprisingly, a lot of quiet reflection. I found myself obsessing over tiny details – like the way my phone’s camera captured a fleeting moment of sunlight, or the frustratingly slow loading times of everything online. 

Specifically, I was locked in a mini-battle with myself about my phone. I’d been clinging to my Pixel 20 Ultra for ages, lured in by its impressive camera. But then, I started comparing it to the newer Pixel 5, and suddenly, it felt…dated. It wasn't *bad*, mind you, but it was just… less. 

It was a weird little symbol, really, of a shift I was experiencing. I realized I was spending so much time chasing the *perfect* photo, the *perfect* online experience, that I was missing the actual moments. The warmth of a cup of coffee, the genuine laugh with a friend – things that couldn't be perfectly framed or instantly shared. 

That Pixel comparison wasn't just about phones; it was about priorities. It was a gentle nudge to put down the screen and actually *be* present.  2020 forced me to re-evaluate what truly mattered, and it’s a lesson I’m still carrying with me today.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a slightly different angle?
