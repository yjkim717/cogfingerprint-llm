"I still fondly remember spending hours playing Pok√©mon Emerald on my Game Boy Advance back in 2005. Fast forward to 2020, and I'm revisiting those nostalgic moments using Visual Boy Advance emulator. I'm currently playing a ROM hack and I'm stuck - I need to figure out how to enter cheat codes. It's funny how some childhood habits never fade, and I'm loving every minute of this retro gaming trip."
