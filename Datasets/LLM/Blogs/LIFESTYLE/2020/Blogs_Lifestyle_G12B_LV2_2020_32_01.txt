## Seattle Soul Recharge: Why Even a Tiny Road Trip Matters

2020. Need I say more? Cabin fever was hitting *hard* here in Seattle. The endless grey skies and the constant news cycle… I just needed *something* different. So, I started dreaming of a little road trip – not a grand adventure, just a quick getaway. 

Seriously, folks, even a 30-minute drive can be a game-changer. I found myself winding along the coast, breathing in the salty air, and feeling the tension slowly melt away. Sometimes, the best reset isn't a week-long vacation; it's a weekend escape, a solo adventure to shake off the city dust. Where are your favorite quick escapes?
