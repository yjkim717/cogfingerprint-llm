The world felt like it was shrinking in 2020. Stuck within the same four walls, my projects became my escape pods. I’d been running a few Docker containers on an old laptop for years—a little media server here, a home automation tool there. But it was a digital sprawl, a messy desk I never had to look at. With time suddenly abundant, I decided it was time to clean up the virtual house. My grand, quarantine-era plan? To migrate everything to a homemade Raspberry Pi **Kubernetes** cluster.

I unboxed the tiny boards, their green PCBs feeling like promises. This wasn't just about running **containers** more efficiently; it was about creating order from chaos. But as I dove in, the real challenge emerged: the invisible world of **networking**. How do I segment my smart toaster from my personal files? I spent an entire weekend wrestling with **VLAN** configurations, feeling like a digital architect trying to build walls out of smoke.

Then came the data. My photos, documents, all the digital clutter of a life—it needed a home. I settled on an old hard drive and set up an **NFS** share. The moment I got it working, when my cluster could reliably see that central storage, was a quiet victory. It was the digital equivalent of finally building that bookshelf you’ve had in a box for months.

In the end, my Raspberry Pi cluster became more than a tech project. In a year of profound disconnection, it was a lesson in connection—in carefully linking pieces together to build something stable and resilient. It taught me that even when the physical world feels limited, you can still find infinite space to build, learn, and create a little corner of order.
