>## Folding Time & Finding Stillness

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? The trails felt closed for so long, and even when they opened, the crowds were a deterrent. Suddenly, our usual escapes felt inaccessible. I found myself staring at gear I hadn't used in months, a low hum of restlessness building. 

Then, almost by accident, I rediscovered origami. Seriously! Those intricate paper folds became a surprisingly meditative practice. It’s a quiet, focused hobby, a miniature world created with my own hands. It’s not the same as summiting a peak, but right now, finding stillness and a small sense of accomplishment feels pretty incredible. Anyone else finding unexpected joy in unexpected places these days?
