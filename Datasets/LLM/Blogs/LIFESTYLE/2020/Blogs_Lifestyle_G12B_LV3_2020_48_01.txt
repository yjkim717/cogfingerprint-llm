## The Border Blues & That Phoenix Pull

Anyone else feel the strange tug of wanting adventure, but also the deep comfort of home? We just spent a lovely weekend in Rocky Point – sunshine, relaxation, the works! Now, staring at those border wait times online, trying to strategize our return to Phoenix feels… surprisingly symbolic of 2020, doesn't it? Balancing escape with the familiar. Wish us luck getting back!
