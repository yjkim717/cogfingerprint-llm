As I navigated the 2020 college application season, I found myself torn between CalState schools. With a decent 4,070 SAT score, I wondered which prestigious options to target. Should I aim for SDSU's renowned business program, SJSU's innovative tech courses, or Cal Poly SLO's esteemed engineering department? Seeking advice, I turned to online forums and friends, ultimately discovering that the right fit depended on more than just prestige â€“ it was about finding my true academic passion.
