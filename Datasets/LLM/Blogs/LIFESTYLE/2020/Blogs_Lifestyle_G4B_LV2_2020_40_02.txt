**The Quiet Struggle of Scrolling**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we can get lost. 2020 was… a lot. Stuck at home, glued to screens, and suddenly, the urge to “just check” felt relentless. I started noticing a pattern – a quick scroll turning into a longer session, a feeling of guilt mixed with a desperate need to *feel* something. 

I realized I was battling a similar thing to what I read about – this pull towards repetitive, stimulating behaviors. It wasn’t about the *lack* of anything, but the *overabundance* of easily-accessed stimulation.  It’s unsettling to think it impacts both men and women, right? 

It made me wonder about our habits, and how easily we can build little addictions, chasing a fleeting high.  It’s a reminder to be mindful, to actively choose what fills our time and energy.
