"Love in the Time of Self-Discovery"

As I sit here in 2020, reflecting on past relationships, I'm filled with a mix of emotions - regret, gratitude, and a deep longing to make things right. To those I've loved and hurt, I want to say sorry. My struggles with intimacy, fueled by a tendency to confuse physical affection with emotional connection, led to a pattern of emotional manipulation. I'd pull you in, only to push you away when things got tough. My avoidance of conflict resolution left us both bruised and confused. But being alone has given me space to grow. I've come to realize that true romantic attraction isn't about possession or control, but about mutual respect and trust. To the one I'm with now, I promise to be different. I'll work on myself, embracing vulnerability and open communication. I'll show up fully, with empathy and understanding, and love you with the depth and care you deserve.
