## Coast FI and the Unexpected Curveball of Parenthood

Remember back in 2020 when Coast FI felt like this achievable, almost breezy path to financial freedom? I certainly did. The idea of letting my investments coast to retirement while maintaining a comfortable lifestyle was incredibly appealing. Then kids arrived. Suddenly, "sacrifice" took on a whole new meaning – less eating out, more DIY everything, and a serious re-evaluation of our spending. 

It’s made me wonder if there’s a vibrant online community out there for Coast FI families. Sharing tips, commiserating about the unexpected costs, and celebrating small wins – it feels like we could all benefit from a little more connection on this journey. Anyone else feeling this?
