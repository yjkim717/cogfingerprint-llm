It’s 2020, and my savings spreadsheet used to be my sanctuary—until kids entered the picture. Suddenly, every dollar had a new destination: diapers, daycare, tiny shoes. The dream of financial independence felt distant, almost mythical. Then I discovered Coast FI—not about hoarding every penny, but building enough to let compound interest do the heavy lifting while we live fully now. It’s a relief to find a community that gets it. We’re not just saving for someday; we’re designing a life worth living today, together.
