>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions and the provided summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and a 2020 context. I've tried to weave in the anxiety theme while expanding it beyond just the driving test.  I've included a couple of options, one leaning slightly more into the driving test struggles and the other a bit broader.  Choose whichever feels best, or let me know if you'd like me to revise!

**Option 1 (More Focused on the Test):**

## The Unexpected Weight of a Theory Test (and Everything Else)

It's 2020, and honestly, who *isn’t* feeling a bit overwhelmed? Between the news, the lockdowns, and just…everything…it’s been a year of adjusting. For me, a seemingly small thing has been adding to the general anxiety: my theory test.

I’ve been diligently doing hazard perception tests, pouring over the DVSA handbook, practically living and breathing road signs. Yet, the closer the test gets, the more my brain seems to short-circuit. I keep freezing up in the mock tests, missing the subtle dangers, the *almost* hazards. It’s ridiculous, I know. It's just a test.

But it feels like more than that. It's a tangible representation of all the things I’m putting off, all the skills I feel I *should* be mastering.  Like learning to bake sourdough (still a disaster), or finally tackling that online course.  This test feels like a benchmark, and failing it feels like failing at…well, at keeping it together in a year that’s been anything but easy.

I guess what I'm realizing is that the anxiety isn't really about spotting a pedestrian stepping out. It’s about the pressure I'm putting on myself to be perfect, to be ‘on track,’ even when the world feels completely off-kilter.  Time to breathe, remember it's just a test, and maybe go for a drive (safely, of course!) to clear my head. Wish me luck!



**Option 2 (Broader Reflection):**

## The Year I Started Questioning Everything (Including My Driving)

2020.  Need I say more? It’s a year that’s forced everyone to slow down, re-evaluate, and generally question *everything*. I’ve been doing a lot of that questioning myself, and it’s surprisingly surfaced in the most unexpected places – like my upcoming theory test.

I’m putting in the hours with those DVSA mock tests, trying to sharpen my hazard perception. It’s frustrating, though! I feel prepared, yet that little voice of doubt keeps creeping in. And it's not just about the test itself. 

Lately, I feel like I’m constantly assessing myself. Am I doing enough? Am I learning enough? Am I *being* enough? The pandemic has stripped away so many of our usual markers of success, hasn't it? Suddenly, career milestones and social calendars feel…less important. 

This test, this small hurdle, feels symbolic. It's a reminder that I'm still striving, still working towards something, even when the ground feels shaky. Maybe the real lesson isn't about spotting
