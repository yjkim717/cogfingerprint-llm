"As I navigated the isolation of 2020, I discovered the immersive world of audiodramas. Engaging stories like 'The Black Tapes' and 'Welcome to Night Vale' became my escape, transporting me to new worlds and perspectives. I devoured recommendations from fellow Redditors, finding solace in the consistent narrative arcs of non-anthology series. Audiodramas revitalized my daily routine, proving that sometimes, the best entertainment is the kind that takes you on a journey."
