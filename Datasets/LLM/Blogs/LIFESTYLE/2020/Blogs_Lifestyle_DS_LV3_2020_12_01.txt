It’s 2020, and let’s be honest—sleep has become a precious commodity. When my doctor first mentioned CPAP therapy, I imagined clunky masks and sleepless nights. But then I tried the ResMed N30, and it was a quiet little game-changer.

As a lifelong side sleeper, I’d resigned myself to mask leaks and pressure marks. The N30’s minimal design, though, actually lets me curl up comfortably without wrestling with headgear. Still, I’m curious—are there even lighter mask alternatives out there? And how do you keep these things clean without a chemistry degree? I’ve been wiping mine down daily, but I wonder if I’m missing a trick.

Most of all, I’ve realized that adapting to CPAP isn’t just about better breathing—it’s about reclaiming rest in a world that feels wide awake with worry. If you’re on this journey too, let’s swap stories. Because in a year of so much noise, a good night’s silence feels like a small, hard-won victory.
