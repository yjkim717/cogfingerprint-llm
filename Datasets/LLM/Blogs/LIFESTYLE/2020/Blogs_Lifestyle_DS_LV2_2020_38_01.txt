I still remember the day they announced the lockdown, thinking it would last a few weeks. Now, months later, our Delhi neighborhood is a red zone again. Cases are climbing, yet I see neighbors gathering, acting like it’s all behind us. But this virus doesn’t pretend. It’s a stark reminder that social distancing isn’t over—it’s a necessary act of care, even when we’re tired of it.
