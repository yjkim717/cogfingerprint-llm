The hum of my laptop, the soft glow of my toddler’s tablet—our 2020 workday soundtrack. My office is now the living room, and my tiny coworker’s attention span is… limited. I swore by minimal screen time, but survival mode has its own rules. So, I’ve begun a quest, scouring streaming services for that magical YouTube channel that’s more "educational" than just hypnotic. It’s a strange new balance, finding digital babysitters that teach while I try to meet a deadline from the couch.
