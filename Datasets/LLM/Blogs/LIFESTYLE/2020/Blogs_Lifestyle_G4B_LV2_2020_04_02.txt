**The Year My Scrum Got… Messy**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 threw *everything* at us, right? And as a team lead, I was trying to keep us all afloat with Scrum – or at least, *trying* to. It quickly became clear I was failing spectacularly. I’d be juggling emails, Slack messages, and half-finished tasks, all while desperately trying to keep everyone on schedule. 

Seriously, the multitasking was a disaster. And the constant lateness to stand-ups? Mortifying. It wasn’t about the process, it was about me – my inability to prioritize and my own scattered energy. 

Looking back, it felt like I was trying to do *everything* instead of leading effectively. It was a humbling reminder that even with the best intentions, a little self-awareness and a focus on team habits can make all the difference.  Anyone else feel this way during the chaos of 2020?
