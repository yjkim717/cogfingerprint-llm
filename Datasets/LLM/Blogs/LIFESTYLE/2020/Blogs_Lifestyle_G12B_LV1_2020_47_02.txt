## The Spreadsheet That Saved My Sanity (and Maybe My Projects)

2020. Need I say more? The year felt like a perpetual state of overwhelm. Juggling work, family, and the general anxiety of… well, everything… left me feeling utterly depleted. I was staring at a never-ending to-do list, paralyzed by the sheer volume of it all.

Then, I stumbled across this idea for "Work Cycles." It sounded a bit… intense, honestly. But desperate times, right? The core concept? Breaking down work into focused, timed bursts – like Pomodoro, but with more structure. I even built a simple Google Sheet to track it.

It’s been surprisingly transformative. Seeing the blocks of focused time, and then the scheduled breaks, makes the mountain of tasks feel a little less daunting. It's not a magic bullet; I still have days where motivation dips. But this system, this *spreadsheet*, has given me a sense of control I desperately needed. It’s a small thing, but in the chaos of 2020, finding a way to engage with work in a more intentional way has felt like a genuine victory.
