## The Hazard Perception of Anxiety (and Life, Honestly)

Okay, so I saw a post on Reddit the other day that just *hit* different. Someone was freaking out about their theory test, specifically the hazard perception part. And it got me thinking – isn't that just a really apt metaphor for life right now? 

2020 has been… a lot. We’re all navigating this weird, unpredictable landscape, constantly scanning for potential hazards. It’s not just about spotting a cyclist pulling out in front of a car (though, you know, *please* look both ways!). It’s about the unexpected job losses, the social isolation, the constant stream of unsettling news. 

This person had done all the right things – revision, driving lessons, prepared. But the anxiety was still there, a knot in their stomach about something they couldn't fully control. And that’s so relatable. We can plan and prepare and study all we want, but life throws curveballs. 

Maybe the key isn't eliminating the anxiety (because let's be real, that's probably impossible), but learning to recognize those potential hazards, acknowledge the feeling, and then… keep driving. Keep moving forward, even when you're not entirely sure what's around the corner. Anyone else feeling this? Let me know in the comments!
