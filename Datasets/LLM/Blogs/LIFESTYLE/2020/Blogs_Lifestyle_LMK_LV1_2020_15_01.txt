The memories that still make me cringe to this day. Like that time in 2020 when our school had to be evacuated due to a gas leak. As we stood outside, waiting for the all-clear, a girl I had been crushing on for a while mustered up the courage to ask for my number. I, in my infinite wisdom, rejected her request. I don't even remember why now - probably just a stupid moment of social awkwardness. Fast forward to today, and I'm still kicking myself for missing that opportunity. What if I had just taken her number? Who knows, maybe we would've been more than just classmates. It's funny how a simple decision can have a lasting impact. I'm left wondering what could've been, and it's a valuable lesson in not letting fear hold me back from taking chances. Sometimes, I wish I could go back and do things differently.
