**Finding the Right Mix**

Remember that scene in *Ozark* where Darlene spikes the heroin? Beyond the murder, what stuck with me was the *method*. She just tossed it in. As someone who’s spent 2020 trying to perfect my sourdough starter, the lack of a uniform mix was jarring. It’s a strange parallel, but it made me think about balance in my own life.

This year has felt like a chaotic cocktail of work-Zoom calls, home-schooling, and endless news cycles. I was just throwing things together, hoping for the best. But you can’t just haphazardly add stress to your day and expect a good result. I’m learning to be more intentional, to stir carefully, and to find my own "uniform distribution" of peace, work, and connection. Because a life, like a recipe, deserves that kind of attention.
