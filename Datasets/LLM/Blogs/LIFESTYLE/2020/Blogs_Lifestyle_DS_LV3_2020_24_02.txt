There’s something about my 2004 Ford Fiesta that feels like a metaphor for 2020. On bright, dry days, it purrs along just fine—reliable, predictable. But the moment rain clouds gather, it sputters and struggles, refusing to start with the same ease. It’s a rough, uncertain idle, a reminder that even the most familiar parts of life can feel shaky when the weather turns. Maybe we’re not so different from old cars after all.
