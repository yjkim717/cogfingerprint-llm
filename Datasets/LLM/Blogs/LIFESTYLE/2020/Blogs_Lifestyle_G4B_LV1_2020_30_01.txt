**The Weight of a Bad Choice**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single, desperate decision can ripple outwards, leaving a trail of… well, everything. I was listening to a story the other day about a woman named Darlene, and it hit me hard. She was in Ozark, struggling, and trying to cut corners with heroin – spiking it with fentanyl to stretch her supply. It felt so reckless, so fundamentally wrong. 

You hear about these “mixing” techniques, and it’s terrifying to think someone would prioritize a quick fix over safety. It made me think about my own moments of wanting to take shortcuts, to avoid the hard work of doing things right.  2020 felt like a year of trying to build something solid, and that story served as a stark reminder – some paths just aren’t worth the risk.
