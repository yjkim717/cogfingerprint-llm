Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and fitting the 2020 context. I've tried to weave in a subtle nod to the "customization" theme without making it overly obvious, focusing on the broader feeling of adapting to change.

## The Year I Learned to Re-Jigger Everything

2020, right? Need I say more? It felt like the rug got pulled out from under all of us, and suddenly, “flexible” wasn’t just a buzzword, it was survival. I spent so much time tweaking my routines, shifting expectations, and basically re-arranging my whole life. My morning coffee ritual? Gone. Weekly yoga class? A hazy memory. Even my grocery list looked different. 

It was exhausting, but also…kind of liberating? Maybe life isn’t about finding a perfect, pre-packaged plan, but about constantly adjusting, layering on what works, and letting go of what doesn't. Anyone else feel like they’ve become a master of the pivot?

**Notes on why I made these choices:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** Uses phrases like "right?", "need I say more?", "anyone else feel..." to directly engage the reader.
*   **Reflective:** Focuses on the *feeling* of the year and the personal growth that came from it, rather than just listing events.
*   **Relatable:** The experience of disrupted routines and needing to adapt is something many people shared in 2020.
*   **Subtle "Customization" Nod:** The idea of "re-arranging my whole life," "layering on what works," and "adjusting" subtly echoes the blog post's original theme without being too on-the-nose.
*   **2020 Context:** Explicitly mentions 2020 to ground the post in that specific time.
