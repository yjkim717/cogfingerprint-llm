**Building My Digital Fortress (and a Little Confidence)**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020 felt like everyone was glued to their screens, and I was suddenly obsessed with building my own PC. I’d always been a ‘buy it and use it’ kind of person, but this felt…different. I wanted a solid base for everything – work, streaming, and maybe a little light gaming. 

Honestly, the whole process was daunting.  I was a complete newbie, staring at CPU/GPU combos and wondering if I was making a colossal mistake.  But I wanted something that wouldn't need replacing every couple of years, a real investment.  It felt good to finally assemble it myself, a small victory in a year of uncertainty. Now, it’s my little digital fortress, and a surprisingly satisfying reminder that I *can* build something lasting.
