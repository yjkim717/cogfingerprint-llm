## The Secret Life of a YouTuber (and Why My Family Doesn't Know)

It’s 2020, and everyone’s online, right? Sharing snippets of their lives, building communities… I jumped in too, started a little YouTube channel a while back. But here’s the thing: it’s a secret. A pretty big one, actually. My family and most of my friends have absolutely no idea.

It wasn't a conscious decision to be secretive, more of a slow realization. This channel, it’s… different. It’s a space where I explore a specific niche, a very particular kind of content. And I worry. Worry about their reactions, about potential judgment, about whether they’d *get* it. 

More than that, I worry about the audience. This community I’ve built feels so precious, so carefully cultivated. I don’t want to muddy the waters with outside opinions, with the expectations of people who don’t share that same passion. It’s a weird, protective instinct, I guess. Maybe someday I’ll tell them. But for now, this little corner of the internet remains my own.
