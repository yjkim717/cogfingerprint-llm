**Lost in the Pixel Dust**

Remember obsessing over finding the *perfect* cheat code? Back in 2020, I was utterly consumed with perfecting my Pokemon Emerald ROM hack on VisualBoyAdvance. Hours spent meticulously entering that master code, chasing a glitch – it felt…important. Looking back, it’s funny how much joy I found in those little digital victories. It wasn’t about *winning*, really, but about escaping into a world of pure, pixelated nostalgia.  Sometimes, I think we all need a little bit of that lost wonder.
