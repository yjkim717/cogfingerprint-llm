As I sat in my cozy living room, surrounded by lush greenery, I couldn't help but think about my DIY aquatic adventure. In 2020, I've been experimenting with creating a thriving underwater world in my home aquarium. One challenge I've been tackling is getting my CO2 levels just right. I've been using a DIY CO2 setup, but I'm eager to optimize it. I'm considering connecting it to my HOB (Hang On Back) filter intake to improve CO2 diffusion. I've heard that using an airstone can help create micro bubbles, increasing the surface area for CO2 to dissolve into the water. I'm excited to try it out and see the difference it makes. As I watch my fish swim happily, I'm reminded that even small tweaks can make a big impact on their environment. It's a hobby that requires patience, but the rewards are well worth it.
