### The Great Indoors & My Driving Anxiety

It’s 2020, and my world has shrunk to the size of my living room. While everyone was mastering sourdough, I decided to tackle a different kind of life skill: learning to drive. It felt ironic, preparing for ultimate freedom during a time of such confinement.

My theory test book became my constant companion. I’d flip through mock tests at the kitchen table, the questions about stopping distances and road signs feeling both mundane and monumentally important. But the real beast was the hazard perception test. Those grainy videos of people stepping off curbs and cars emerging from side roads started to haunt my dreams.

My driving lessons were these precious, surreal bubbles of normalcy—just me, my instructor (masked and sanitized, of course), and the empty roads. But the anxiety would creep back in the moment I got home. Was I really ready?

I realized this wasn't just about passing a test. It was about proving to myself that I could still move forward, even when the world felt like it had slammed on the brakes. That little "pass" certificate would be more than a permit to drive; it would be a token of hope, a promise that the open road was still out there, waiting.
