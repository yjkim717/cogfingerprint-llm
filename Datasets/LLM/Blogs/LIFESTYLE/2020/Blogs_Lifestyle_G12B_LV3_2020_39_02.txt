## Beyond the Usual Suspects: Finding Your CalState Fit

Okay, so you're rocking a great GPA and eyeing a CalState for psychology or biology? Awesome! You've probably heard SDSU, SJSU, and Cal Poly SLO mentioned a lot â€“ and for good reason, they're solid choices. But what if you're looking for something *slightly* different? 

I remember feeling that way back in 2020, sifting through options, wanting to find a place that felt like *me*. There are so many other fantastic CalState campuses out there with strong programs and unique vibes. Don't be afraid to dig a little deeper! Research faculty, campus culture, and location. Your perfect fit might be waiting just beyond the well-trodden path.
