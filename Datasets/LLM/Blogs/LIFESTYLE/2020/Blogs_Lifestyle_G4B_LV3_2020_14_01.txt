**Finding Comfort in Simple Meals**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a turning point for me. The stay-at-home orders forced a stillness I hadn’t realized I craved, but also a scramble to find new routines. Suddenly, takeout felt…wrong. I started experimenting with incredibly simple meals – things like a flaky tilapia with roasted broccoli, all cooked in the crock-pot. 

There’s something so grounding about slow cooking, isn’t there? And the pesto! I’ve been obsessed with whipping up quick pesto sauces to drizzle over everything. It’s a small shift, swapping takeout for a little home cooking, but it's become a surprisingly powerful way to create a sense of calm and nourish myself during a chaotic time.  It's about finding joy in the everyday, one healthy meal at a time.
