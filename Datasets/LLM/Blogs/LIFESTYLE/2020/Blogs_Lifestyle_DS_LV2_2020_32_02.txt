The world felt so small in 2020, my passport gathering dust. But the urge to explore never left. So, I booked a flight to San Diego, my first real trip in months. It wasn't about grand adventures, but about relearning how to be somewhere else. To walk a new neighborhood, masked and mindful, felt like a radical act of hope. It was a quiet reminder that the spirit of travel is resilient, even when our plans are not.
