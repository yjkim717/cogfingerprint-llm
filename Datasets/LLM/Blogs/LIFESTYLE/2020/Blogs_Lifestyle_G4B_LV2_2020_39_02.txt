**The Weight of “Best”**

2020 felt like everyone was chasing the “best” – the best job, the best apartment, the best… college? I was staring at Cal State apps, obsessing over which school felt “more prestigious.” Honestly, it felt exhausting.  I realized then that “best” is so personal. SDSU’s booming, SJSU’s close, Cal Poly SLO’s beautiful – it’s about *where* I’d thrive, not some arbitrary ranking.  It was a huge relief to let go of that pressure.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a different version with a slightly altered focus?
