**The Weight of a Zoom Call**

It’s strange, isn’t it? How a simple Zoom call can feel like the weight of the world settling on your shoulders. That’s exactly how it felt last March, staring at my laptop screen, watching my daughter, Sarah, navigate her first college quarantine. 

We were in the thick of it, 2020, a year that felt like a relentless, chaotic movie. Sarah had tested positive for COVID – a terrifying moment for any parent, let alone one watching her from afar. But beyond the immediate fear for her health, there was this swirling anxiety about her family. Would we be next? How would we protect each other while she isolated?

I found myself oscillating between desperately wanting to *fix* everything and just… letting her feel it. The emotional distress was palpable, even over a digital connection. It was a parenting dilemma unlike any I’d faced. 

Those weeks were a masterclass in letting go, in trusting that she was strong, and in recognizing that my worry wasn’t helping anyone. It was a reminder that family, and connection, truly matter most, especially when everything else feels so uncertain.
