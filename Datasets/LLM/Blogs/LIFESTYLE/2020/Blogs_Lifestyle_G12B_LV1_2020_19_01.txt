>## The Deck Dreams on Hold (and My Wallet's Sigh of Relief)

It feels like everything's gotten…expensive, doesn't it? 2020 has been a year of adjustments, and for me, one of those adjustments involves the very real possibility of postponing a dream. I'd been planning to build a small deck off the back of the house – a little outdoor oasis for morning coffee and evening sunsets. A simple project, I thought. Just a weekend warrior's ambition.

Then I went to Home Depot.

Seriously, the price of pressure-treated lumber, or "PT lumber" as the folks there called it, was *shocking*. I'd vaguely remembered looking at prices a year or two ago, and they seemed reasonable. But now? It felt like I needed a small loan to get enough for a few square feet. 

I did some digging online, comparing lumber prices, and the trend is clear: it's been climbing steadily. It's making me seriously reconsider the whole thing. Maybe a well-placed patio umbrella and some comfy chairs will suffice for now.  It’s a little disappointing, sure, but honestly? My wallet is breathing a huge sigh of relief. Maybe 2021 will be the year of the deck. For now, I'm embracing the chill of a slightly less ambitious outdoor space.
