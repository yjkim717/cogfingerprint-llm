"As I navigated the world of web development in 2020, a common question arose: do I need XAMPP to host my PHP website online? The answer lies in understanding the role of XAMPP - it's a local server environment, not a requirement for hosting. I realized that once I uploaded my PHP files to a hosting company, they would be executed on the server, making XAMPP redundant. A simple yet liberating insight that streamlined my website deployment process."
