## The Emails I Never Sent (and Why 2020 Felt Like the Time to Write Them)

Remember early 2020? The world felt like it was holding its breath. For me, it was less about the virus and more about a slow, quiet reckoning. I found myself thinking a *lot* about past relationships – not with bitterness, but with a surprising wave of… apology.

Not grand, dramatic apologies, but little ones. "I'm sorry I wasn’t a better listener." "I'm sorry I prioritized work over date nights." “I’m sorry I didn’t understand your love language.” I drafted emails I never sent, pouring out these quiet regrets. They weren't meant to change anything; those chapters were closed. 

But writing them? It was strangely liberating. Like clearing out mental clutter. It highlighted how much I’ve grown, how much I value communication *now*, and how fiercely I want to show up for the person I'm with. 2020 was a year of forced introspection, and for me, it started with acknowledging the imperfections of my past, paving the way for a more conscious and compassionate present.
