## The Weight of Choices, Even in Virtual Worlds

It's funny how anxieties bleed over. Lately, I've been wrestling with world selection in Runescape Hardcore – trying to find a relatively quiet, populated server for my red skull character. Sounds ridiculous, right? But it’s mirroring a feeling I have in real life. 

2020 has felt like a constant stream of choices, each with unseen consequences. Do I go out? Stay in? Engage? Retreat? It's exhausting.  Just like endlessly refreshing the Runescape world list, hoping for the *right* place, I’ve been searching for the optimal path. Maybe there isn’t one, and maybe the real challenge is just accepting wherever I land. It’s a lesson, pixelated or otherwise.
