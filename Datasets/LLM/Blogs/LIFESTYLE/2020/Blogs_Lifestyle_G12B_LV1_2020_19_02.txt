## The Year I Almost Bought a Hot Tub (and What It Taught Me)

2020. Need I say more? It was the year of lockdowns, sourdough, and a *lot* of time spent staring out the window, dreaming. I think we all did it. And for me, that dreaming manifested in a serious, almost debilitating obsession with hot tubs.

It started innocently enough. Just browsing online, you know, escaping. But then I stumbled upon this *deal*. An $8,000 Royal Spas hot tub. Eight thousand dollars! It seemed… decadent. And yet, the idea of sinking into warm, bubbling water after a long day of Zoom meetings and homeschooling felt like the ultimate self-care.

I got completely sucked in. I researched insulation, circulation pumps, the whole shebang. I even started calculating how much it would add to our electricity bill – a surprisingly daunting task! My husband just watched, amused, as I debated seating capacity and jet configurations.

Ultimately, we didn't do it. The cost, the upkeep, the sheer *responsibility* of owning a hot tub just felt… too much for where we were at. It was a good reminder that sometimes, the things we think we desperately need are really just a distraction from the things we already have. And honestly, a long walk in the crisp autumn air felt pretty good too.
