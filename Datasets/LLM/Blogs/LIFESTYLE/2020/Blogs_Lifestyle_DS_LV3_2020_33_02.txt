It’s strange how a single moment can shift your entire perspective. For me, it happened in early 2020, during one of those endless video calls that had become the backdrop of our lives. A well-meaning relative, her face pixelated on my screen, looked at me and said, “You’ve been home for months! I bet you’re finally getting in shape.” The comment was a casual grenade, lobbed with a smile, and it detonated in the silence that followed. I forced a laugh, but inside, I felt that familiar, cold wash of shame. It was a stark reminder that even in a global health crisis, the expectation to conform to a specific body ideal hadn’t paused.

That moment sent me down a rabbit hole. Stuck at home, I began consuming media differently. I noticed how every other ad seemed to be for home workout equipment or a new diet, all preying on the anxiety of the “Quarantine 15.” The message was clear: your body is a problem to be solved, especially now. But I also found pockets of resistance. I stumbled into the vibrant, defiant world of body positivity online. It wasn’t just about feeling good in a bikini; it was a radical challenge to the very assumption that my relative had voiced—that weight and health are one and the same.

I learned about health stigma, the pervasive and damaging belief that you can assess a person’s wellness simply by looking at them. This stigma fuels weight shaming, making public spaces, doctor's offices, and even family Zoom calls feel like judgment zones. The movement opened my eyes to the fact that health is not a moral obligation, nor is it a size. It’s a deeply personal, multifaceted state that includes mental well-being, which for me was being steadily eroded by the pressure to be "productive" with my body during a pandemic.

Most importantly, body positivity pushed for representation beyond the thin, able-bodied norm. I started following activists with disabilities, who spoke powerfully about their right to exist comfortably in their bodies without having to justify their health to strangers. Their stories reframed everything. My goal wasn’t to emerge from 2020 with a “better” body, but to finally make peace with the one I have. It’s a daily practice of rejecting the shame, of seeking out media that represents diverse bodies, and of understanding that my worth is not a number on a scale. In a year that took so much, this was a gift: the quiet, stubborn revolution of learning to live in my own skin, unapologetically.
