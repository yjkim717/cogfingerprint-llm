## The Year My Budget Became a Globe-Trotter (and So Did I)

2020. What a year, right? For most, it meant lockdowns and a sudden shift to working from home. For me, it was… a little more complicated. We’d just moved to Singapore, a whirlwind of packing, shipping containers, and saying goodbye to everything familiar. Suddenly, I was navigating a new culture, a new job, and a whole new set of financial complexities.

It wasn’t just the cost of groceries being different; it was *everything*. My savings were back home in Euros, my salary was in Singapore Dollars, and I was occasionally sending money to family in the UK. My spreadsheets, bless their little hearts, were quickly becoming a chaotic mess.

That’s when I stumbled upon Aspire. Honestly, I was desperate! The ability to track expenses in multiple currencies, see the impact of exchange rates in real-time, and essentially create *separate budgets* for different purposes – it was a game-changer. It felt like finally gaining control of a situation that had felt completely overwhelming. 

It’s been a steep learning curve, trying to factor in international brokerage fees and understand the nuances of financial life abroad. But with Aspire, I feel like I’m not just surviving, I’m actually *planning* – and that’s a huge relief amidst all the other uncertainties of 2020. Who knew a budgeting app could feel like a little piece of stability in a constantly shifting world?
