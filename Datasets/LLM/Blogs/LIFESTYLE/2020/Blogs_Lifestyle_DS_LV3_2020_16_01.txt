It’s 2020, and the world feels like it’s paused, but my ambitions haven’t. As a computer engineering student, I’ve been spending these quiet evenings diving into side projects—tinkering with low-level programming and experimenting with machine learning models. It’s not just about coding; it’s about building a bridge to the stars.

I dream of contributing to the space industry someday, where AI development could help unravel cosmic mysteries. Each line of code feels like a small step toward that future. In a year of uncertainty, these projects ground me, reminding me that even from my desk, I can reach for something infinite.
