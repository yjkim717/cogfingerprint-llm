## The Unexpected Peace of Debugging My Digital Life

2020. What a year, right? We all had our routines upended, our anxieties amplified. For me, a lot of that anxiety centered around my website. It started as a simple hobby blog, a place to share recipes and thoughts on gardening. But it grew, and with it, a tangled mess of WordPress plugins, custom PHP snippets, and a database that felt increasingly like a cryptic puzzle.

Honestly, I felt overwhelmed. I’d read countless articles aimed at the average user – “5 Easy Plugins to Boost Your Site!” – but I craved something deeper. I wanted to *understand* how it all worked, how the Javascript on the front end talked to the PHP on the server, how the database held everything together.

So, I dove in. I started tracing code, poking around the database, and slowly, painstakingly, began to unravel the complexity. It wasn't glamorous. There were frustrating hours spent staring at error messages, feeling utterly lost. But then, there were these moments of clarity, these little "aha!" moments when a connection clicked into place.

And something unexpected happened. Debugging my website, wrestling with the technical details, became… calming. It was a focused, tangible problem to solve in a world that felt increasingly chaotic. It was a quiet, solitary pursuit that grounded me. 

It’s a strange thing, finding peace in PHP and Javascript, but in 2020, I learned that sometimes, the most unexpected places offer the most solace. Now, my website still isn't perfect, but I understand it better, and that makes all the difference.
