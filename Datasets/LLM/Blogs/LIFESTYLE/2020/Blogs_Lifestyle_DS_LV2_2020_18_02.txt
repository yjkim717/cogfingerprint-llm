Remember those early 2020 evenings, when the world outside went quiet? I filled the silence with stories. Iâ€™d walk empty streets, headphones on, completely lost in the rich, consistent worlds of podcasts like *Bronzeville* and *Video Palace*. They weren't anthologies; they were full, gripping novels for my ears. In a year of so much uncertainty, their unwavering quality from start to finish was a narrative anchor I desperately needed. A small, steady comfort in the chaos.
