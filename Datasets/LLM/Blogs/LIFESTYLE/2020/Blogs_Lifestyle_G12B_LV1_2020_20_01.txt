## Giving Old Tech a New Life (and Helping Trees!)

It's 2020, and let’s be honest, we’re *all* drowning in stuff. I was staring at a pile of old phones, chargers, and a truly ancient MP3 player the other day, feeling that familiar pang of guilt. Where do these things *go*? Landfills, mostly, which isn’t great for anyone.

Then I stumbled upon a local event – a Forest Planet e-waste recycling drive. It was surprisingly easy! Just dropped off my old tech, and learned they actually repurpose the materials and, crucially, plant trees. Seriously, *trees*. 

It felt so good to do something tangible to reduce waste and support reforestation. It’s a small thing, but in a year that’s felt pretty overwhelming, it’s been nice to find a little way to contribute to a healthier planet. Maybe we all need to look for those easy wins.
