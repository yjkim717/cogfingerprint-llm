## The Digital Clutter is Real (and I Need Help!)

Okay, Reddit fam, let's be honest. Remember back in 2020 when everything felt… a little much? Well, my Reddit feed is mirroring that feeling. All these awards piling up – gold, silver, even those quirky custom ones – it's visually overwhelming! I wish the Apollo app had a simple way to categorize them, maybe even a "favorites" list. Just a little organization to bring some calm to the chaos, you know? Anyone else feeling this digital clutter?
