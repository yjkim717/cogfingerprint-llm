It feels strange to even write this, looking back to 2020. Delhi was… intense. The news was a constant drumbeat of COVID cases, yet it felt like so many people were just going through the motions – a hurried walk, a brief wave, a dismissal.  I remember feeling a deep sadness, a quiet frustration that the *reality* of the pandemic wasn’t fully sinking in.  Social distancing wasn’t a suggestion, it was a vital act of kindness.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, simply acknowledging the weight of a shared experience is the most powerful thing we can do.
