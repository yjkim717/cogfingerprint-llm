"Embracing the Joy of Cooking with Cast Iron

As I stood in my kitchen in the spring of 2020, I realized that my trusty 15" Lodge cast iron skillet was feeling a bit cramped on my old stovetop. The burner was too small, and I was tired of having to adjust my cooking techniques to fit the limitations of my cooktop. I started thinking about upgrading to a new stovetop, one with a large burner that could accommodate my beloved skillet. I was also drawn to the idea of induction cooking, having heard rave reviews about its efficiency and precision. As I researched my options, I considered the pros and cons of electric stovetops versus induction. Ultimately, I wanted a cooktop that would let me cook with ease and flexibility. For me, it's not just about cooking - it's about creating a warm and inviting space to share with loved ones."
