**The Chaos of "Doing It All" – And Why It Almost Broke My Team**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was simultaneously juggling a million things – working from home, homeschooling, trying to stay sane. My team at work wasn’t immune. We were desperately clinging to our Scrum process, but it quickly devolved into a beautiful mess of multitasking, late arrivals, and a surprising amount of hallway chatter. 

Honestly, it was exhausting just *watching* us. We were prioritizing speed over genuine collaboration, and productivity plummeted. It became clear we needed a leadership reset – not a dictatorial one, but a gentle nudge to refocus on the core values of our process. 

What really shifted our perspective was a conversation about accountability. We started small, acknowledging where we fell short and actively supporting each other. Suddenly, those side conversations quieted, and people started showing up, truly present. 

It taught me a powerful lesson: sometimes, the biggest productivity killer isn't a lack of tools, but a lack of intentional communication and a shared commitment to working *together*.  It’s a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, prioritizing team dynamics can make all the difference.
