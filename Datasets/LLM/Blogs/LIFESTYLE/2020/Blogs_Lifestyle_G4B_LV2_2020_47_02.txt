**The Year I Almost Burned Out (and How I Learned to Listen)**

2020, right? It felt like everyone was sprinting. The “hustle” was practically a religion, and I was right there with them, chasing productivity like it was the key to happiness. I dove headfirst into “ultraworking,” convinced more hours equaled more success. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. 

I was completely ignoring my own energy levels, fueled by caffeine and a desperate need to *do*. Then, I hit a wall – a really loud, exhausted wall. That’s when I stumbled upon the idea of “work cycles.” It wasn’t about working *more*, but working *smarter*, scheduling in breaks and truly listening to my body. 

It was a slow, messy process, but learning to respect my limits actually boosted my motivation and productivity in the long run.  Anyone else feel this pull to overwork?
