## The Unexpected Joy of Slow Mornings

Remember 2020? Everything felt…rushed. Work from home blurred into evenings, and relaxation felt like a luxury. Then, something shifted. I started waking up *before* my to-do list. Just…being. Sipping coffee, watching the sunrise. It’s funny how slowing down, even just a little, can bring so much peace. Now, those quiet moments are my favorite part of the day.
