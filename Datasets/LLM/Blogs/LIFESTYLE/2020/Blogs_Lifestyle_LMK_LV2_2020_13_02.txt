As I sit here in my home office, surrounded by screens and cables, I'm reminded of the tech struggles I've faced in 2020. Like many, I've turned to virtualization to get work done, but it's been a journey. Configuring Hyper-V to play nice with my host network while keeping Wake-on-LAN alive was a real challenge. It's funny how a problem like that can make you appreciate the little things in life - like a reliable internet connection. It's a reminder that sometimes, it's the behind-the-scenes tech that keeps our modern lifestyle humming.
