It was March 2020, and the world had gone quiet. One Saturday, out of habit, I wandered into my usual sports bar. But the TVs were dark. No roaring crowds, no frantic commentators. Just the low hum of hesitant conversation.

And something clicked.

Without the glare of the screen demanding our attention, we started talking—really talking. We weren't just a "game day crowd" shouting at a distraction; we were neighbors sharing a bewildered moment in history. The deadened silence of the outside world gave way to a gentle, genuine social atmosphere inside.

I left wondering why it took a global shutdown to realize how much those televisions had been mediating our interactions. Now, more than ever, we need spaces that prioritize connection over broadcast. I’m not sure sports will ever feel the same again—and maybe that’s a good thing.
