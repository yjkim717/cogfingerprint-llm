As I sat down to think about my experience with web development in 2020, I couldn't help but wonder: do we really need routing in our non-trivial web applications? As someone who's worked extensively with Single Page Applications (SPAs) and React, I've often found myself questioning the necessity of this fundamental concept.

At first glance, routing seems like an essential part of web development. It helps us navigate between different views or pages within an application, creating a seamless user experience. But, as I reflected on my own projects, I realized that I've often relied on routing out of habit rather than necessity.

In SPAs, the entire application is loaded on a single page, and React makes it easy to manage state changes and updates without requiring a full page reload. So, in many cases, routing can feel like an added layer of complexity that doesn't necessarily enhance the user experience.

As I pondered this, I began to see parallels between routing in web development and the way we navigate our daily lives. Just as a well-designed application can guide users through a series of steps, a clear plan and structure can help us navigate our own daily routines. By streamlining our workflows and eliminating unnecessary detours, we can create a more seamless and efficient experience – both online and offline.

In the end, I realized that routing is just a tool – and like any tool, its value lies in how we use it. By being mindful of when and how we apply routing, we can create more intuitive and user-friendly applications that, in turn, inspire us to simplify and streamline our own lives.
