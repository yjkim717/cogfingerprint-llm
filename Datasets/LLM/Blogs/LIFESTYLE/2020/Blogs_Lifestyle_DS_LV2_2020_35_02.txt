### The Unlikely Zen of Building a PC

It’s 2020, and my world has shrunk to the size of my apartment. With all this newfound time, I decided to tackle a project I’d always put off: building my first PC.

My kitchen table became a chaotic workshop, littered with components. I spent hours agonizing over a Ryzen 3600 versus an Intel chip, my browser flooded with tabs on motherboards and graphics cards. My goal was simple: faster video editing for my little vlogs.

But a funny thing happened during the build. As I carefully clicked the RAM into place and routed cables, the frantic noise in my head quieted. In a year of overwhelming uncertainty, here was a problem I could actually solve. Each connected piece was a small, tangible victory.

Now, when I fire up Handbrake to transcode a video, the gentle hum of the fans is a reminder. Sometimes, the project isn’t really about the final product. It’s about the quiet focus you find along the way, building something new for yourself, one piece at a time.
