There’s something about 2020 that made solo Minecraft on PC feel a little too quiet. I’d spend hours building, but the silence was deafening. So, I hopped on Discord, sent a few casual invites, and everything changed. Suddenly, a simple cobblestone hut became a collaborative castle. A lonely mining trip turned into a shared adventure, filled with laughter as someone inevitably fell into lava. It wasn't about beating the game; it was about the company. In a year we spent so much time apart, those pixelated blocky worlds with friends became a surprising, heartwarming anchor—a little corner of togetherness.
