"Stuck at home in 2020, I found myself obsessing over one thing - my typing experience. As a keyboard enthusiast, I was on a mission to try out different Cherry MX switches. Pandemic shopping sprees became my norm, with switches arriving at my doorstep daily. As I clicked away, I realized that the right mechanical keyboard wasn't just about productivity, it was about comfort and joy. Experimenting with Cherry MX switches became a soothing ritual, a small pleasure in a chaotic world. It was a reminder that sometimes, it's the little things that bring us the most happiness."
