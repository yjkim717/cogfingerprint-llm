## Finding My Kitchen Calm (and Actually Eating Healthy!)

It's wild to think we're nearing the end of 2020, isn't it? This year has thrown *everything* at us, and honestly, keeping track of what I ate felt like a monumental task for a while. Takeout was my friend, and not the healthy kind. 

But somewhere around mid-summer, I realized I needed a reset. Not just for my waistline, but for my *brain*. I started small – simple dinners, really. Baked tilapia with a squeeze of lemon became a surprisingly regular thing. It’s so easy, and honestly, the bright flavor just felt… good. 

Then I rediscovered my crock-pot! Seriously, throwing chicken breasts in with a jar of salsa or a little teriyaki sauce and letting it do its thing has been a game-changer. It's one less thing to stress about after a long day of Zoom calls and news updates.  Finding these little pockets of calm in the kitchen has been a small victory in a really chaotic year. What about you – what’s been your go-to easy meal lately?
