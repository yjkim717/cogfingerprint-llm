As I navigated my master's program in developmental psychology in 2020, I found myself pondering the intricacies of human behavior. One concept that kept surfacing was the fundamental attribution error - our tendency to blame character rather than circumstances when things go wrong. It struck me how often this bias plays out in our daily lives, affecting our relationships and understanding of others. I became curious about how mental health training could influence this bias. Can education and training help us become more empathetic and less judgmental? Exploring this question led me to consider the broader implications for human development. By examining the intersection of mental health training and cognitive biases, we may uncover new pathways to fostering a more compassionate and nuanced understanding of ourselves and others. This journey has been a powerful reminder that personal growth is deeply intertwined with our ability to understand others.
