## The Price of Passion Projects (and Squarespace!)

Okay, so I've been seriously contemplating launching an online course. It's been a simmering dream for ages – sharing what I've learned about photography – but the practicalities are… daunting. I stumbled across this $899 course geared towards creatives using Squarespace, and wow, it's shiny! The tutorial videos look incredible, and I’m intrigued by the latest Squarespace features they showcase.

But $899? That's a serious investment. It really got me thinking about the cost of pursuing passions in 2020. Is it a worthwhile leap, or am I better off building this organically? Still pondering… anyone else wrestled with this kind of decision?
