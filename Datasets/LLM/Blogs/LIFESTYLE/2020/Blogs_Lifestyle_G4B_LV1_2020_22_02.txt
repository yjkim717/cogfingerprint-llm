**Basement Blues & a Little Worry**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2020 was all about Zoom calls and hand sanitizer, but I was also dealing with a surprisingly unsettling discovery – elevated radon levels in my basement. My home test kit showed 5-9 pCi/L, and honestly, it gave me a little shiver.  

I’m not a huge DIY-er, but the thought of invisible gas lurking beneath my feet felt… unsettling.  I started researching, learning about PCI/L and mitigation options. It's a reminder that even in our carefully curated lives, there are unseen factors impacting our comfort and safety.  Time to call a professional, I think!
