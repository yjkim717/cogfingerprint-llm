**The Day the Gas Leak Ruined Everything (and Maybe My Life)**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? Pandemic, political chaos, the general feeling that the world was subtly tilting. But there’s one specific moment that still sticks with me, a tiny, absurd regret. 

It was late October. I was at university, feeling pretty lost, and this girl, Chloe, suggested we totally pull a fast one – fake a note from our parents to sneak out for a movie. Classic, I know. I was about to say yes when a piercing alarm blared – a gas leak! 

Suddenly, the whole ridiculous scheme evaporated. I spent the next hour huddled with everyone, just… existing. Chloe was gone. It felt like a tiny, missed opportunity, a tiny "tifu" moment. 

Looking back, it’s silly. But it's a reminder that sometimes the biggest regrets aren’t about grand gestures, but the little things we let slip away in the chaos of the day.  It makes you wonder what else you’re missing.
