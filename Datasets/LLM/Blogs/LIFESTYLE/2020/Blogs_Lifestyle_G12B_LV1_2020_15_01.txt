>## The Day the World Smelled Like Chlorine and What-Ifs

It's funny the things that linger, isn't it? Not the big, dramatic moments, but the tiny, almost insignificant ones. I was thinking about that the other day, scrolling through old photos from 2020 – a year that felt like a collective pause button on life. 

We were all stuck in a weird limbo then, navigating online classes and a constant hum of anxiety. One afternoon, during a particularly dull lecture (honestly, who remembers the intricacies of the Louisiana Purchase in the middle of a pandemic?), Sarah, the girl who sat next to me, leaned over with a mischievous glint in her eyes.

She’d heard about a reported gas leak at a nearby business and, with the school emptying out, proposed a ridiculous plan: “Let’s just say we’re each other’s parents and get out of here.” It was pure, impulsive silliness. 

I laughed it off. Too awkward. Too much potential for embarrassment. I probably mumbled something about being responsible. 

Now, years later, I still smell chlorine and a whiff of regret. It wasn't about escaping school. It was about a fleeting moment of shared absurdity, a possible connection I politely shut down. A tiny opportunity missed, lost in the fog of teenage overthinking. Just a reminder that sometimes, the silliest "what-ifs" sting the most.
