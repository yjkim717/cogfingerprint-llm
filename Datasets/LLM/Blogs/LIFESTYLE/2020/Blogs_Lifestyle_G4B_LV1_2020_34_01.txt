**The Quiet Quest of 2020**

Honestly, 2020 was *loud*. Between the news, the Zoom calls, and the general anxiety, finding moments of peace felt like a real challenge. That’s why I started tinkering with a 3D printer – a little creative outlet to ground myself. I quickly ran into a problem: the fan noise was driving me crazy! 

I ended up building a makeshift enclosure and experimenting with airflow, trying to mimic how a good door seal would dampen the sound. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it was a surprisingly meditative process – a tiny act of control in a year that felt utterly chaotic.  Sometimes, the smallest adjustments bring the biggest calm.
