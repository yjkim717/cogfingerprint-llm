## The Quiet Hum of Progress (and PLA!)

It's funny, isn't it, how hobbies can bleed into your whole life? Lately, mine has been 3D printing. I picked up a Creator Pro 2 last year – a bit of an impulse buy during the 2020 lockdowns, if I'm honest. It’s been a fantastic creative outlet, but that constant whirring of the fans… it was starting to drive me a little mad!

So, I’ve been tinkering with the enclosure, trying to create a better ventilation system so I can close the door while printing PLA. It’s a small project, really, but it feels bigger than that. It’s about finding a little more peace and quiet in a world that feels increasingly chaotic. It’s about taking control, even in a tiny way, and making something work *better* for me. And honestly, the satisfaction of a successful print, with a significantly quieter fan, is pretty darn rewarding. Anyone else finding solace in DIY projects these days?
