## The Quiet Spaces and the Whispers of Hope

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? For so many of us, it’s brought a stark awareness of loneliness. The enforced isolation, the cancelled plans, the distance from loved ones – it’s all amplified the quiet spaces in our lives. I know I’ve felt it keenly. There were days where the silence felt deafening, a constant reminder of what was missing.

But even in those quiet spaces, something else started to emerge: a quiet hope. A realization that connection isn't always about physical presence. It’s about reaching out, nurturing existing relationships, and even opening yourself up to the possibility of new ones. 

Happiness isn't a destination, it's a practice. And right now, for me, it’s about finding joy in the small things, and holding onto the belief that even after this year, meaningful relationships and a sense of belonging are still within reach. It’s a whisper, maybe, but it’s a whisper worth listening to.
