As I sat at my PC in 2020, surrounded by the familiar blocks of Minecraft, I realized I'd been gaming solo for too long. The pandemic had me stuck at home, and while my private realm was a comforting escape, I yearned for connection. I turned to Discord, seeking like-minded players to build and explore with. Casual online gaming became a lifeline, allowing me to share experiences and forge new friendships. It was a reminder that even in isolation, community was just a click away.
