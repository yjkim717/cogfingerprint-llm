It’s 2020, and I’ve had a revelation: chasing full financial independence felt like sprinting a marathon with my kids on my back. Every extra shift, every skipped vacation—it just didn’t add up. Then I discovered Coast FI. It’s not about stopping; it’s about pacing. Saving enough early so my investments grow, freeing me to focus on what matters now: bedtime stories, park days, and real connections. I’m looking for others walking this path—because community makes the journey meaningful. Anyone else out there?
