There I was in 2020, trying to recreate that effortless cool from my favorite films—pouring a neat whiskey like the Hollywood heroes do. But instead of looking suave while solving mysteries, I just grimaced at the bitter burn. It hit me: movie drinking is pure fantasy.

In reality, my friends and I were huddled on Zoom calls, mixing amateur cocktails with whatever we had in our pantries. That’s where the real connection happened—laughing over too-sweet concoctions and shared lockdown stories. Screenwriters forget that liquor isn’t a personality prop; it’s the backdrop for genuine, messy human moments. So I’ll take my clinking ice cubes and laughter-filled gatherings over solitary sophistication any day. After all, life’s richness isn’t in the glass—it’s in the company we keep.
