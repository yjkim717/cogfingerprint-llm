## The Unexpected Side Effect of My Fast

Okay, so I jumped on the intermittent fasting bandwagon last fall – 2020 felt like a *perfect* time to reset, right? Everything was going smoothly… until my mouth started feeling like the Sahara. Dry mouth became a constant companion. I instinctively reached for a sugary candy, but then remembered the whole point of fasting! It would just spike my hunger later. Figuring out ways to cope – sipping water, chewing sugar-free gum – has been a surprisingly important part of the journey. Small victories, I guess!
