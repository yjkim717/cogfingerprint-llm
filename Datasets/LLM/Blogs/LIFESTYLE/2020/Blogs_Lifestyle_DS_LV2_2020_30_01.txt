**The Unlikely Lessons of 2020**

It’s wild the things that make you pause for reflection these days. The other night, I was watching *Ozark*—because what else is there to do in 2020?—and saw that infamous scene where Darlene spikes the heroin with fentanyl. My mind didn’t go to the drama, but to a Vice documentary I’d seen on harm reduction.

It struck me how this year has been one long lesson in careful mixing. Not of drugs, God no, but of life’s ingredients. We’ve all been trying to blend work, home, sanity, and fear into a sustainable daily cocktail. Some days the mix is volatile; other days, you find a surprising balance.

That TV moment was a dark mirror. It reminded me that what we choose to add to our own "mix"—a new hobby, a boundary, a five-minute meditation—can be the difference between just coping and genuinely thriving, even now. It's all about being intentional with the recipe.
