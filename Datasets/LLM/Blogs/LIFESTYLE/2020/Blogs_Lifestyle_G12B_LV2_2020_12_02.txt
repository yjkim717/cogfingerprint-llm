## The Year I Learned Patience (and Built a PC)

2020. What a year, right? It felt like the world collectively held its breath for a while. For me, a big chunk of that time was spent… building a gaming PC. Sounds random, I know.

I’d always admired people who could tinker and create their own rigs. It seemed like such a *thing*. Honestly, I thought it was way beyond me. But with lockdowns and more time than I knew what to do with, I took the plunge.

It was… humbling. Hours spent watching YouTube tutorials, agonizing over motherboard compatibility, and the sheer *panic* of installing the CPU cooler. There were moments I genuinely wanted to throw the whole thing out the window. But slowly, painstakingly, it came together.

And you know what? The feeling of powering it on for the first time, seeing that glorious glow, was incredible. It wasn’t just about the games; it was about the journey, the problem-solving, the sheer satisfaction of creating something with my own hands. 2020 threw a lot at us, but at least I have a ridiculously powerful PC to escape into.
