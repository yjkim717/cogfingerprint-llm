**The Night My Life Changed (and My Mask Got Really Dirty)**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of big changes, right? And for me, one of the biggest was starting CPAP therapy. I’d been struggling with sleep apnea for ages, and finally getting a machine felt like a huge win. I went with the ResMed N30 – surprisingly comfortable, actually – but let’s be real, the mask cleaning was a whole *thing*. 

I was a messy sleeper, and that mask quickly became a biohazard. I was frantically researching the best way to clean it, and seriously considering a nasal pillow instead.  Sleeping on my side was a nightmare, so I started experimenting with pillows and positions. It was a frustrating, but ultimately rewarding, process.  It’s funny how something so small – a mask and a little bit of effort – can have such a profound impact on your sleep and your whole life.
