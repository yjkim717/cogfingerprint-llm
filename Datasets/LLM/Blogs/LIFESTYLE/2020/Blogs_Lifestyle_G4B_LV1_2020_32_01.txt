**Escape Route: Yearning for a Seattle Road Trip in 2020**

Honestly, 2020 felt like one long exhale. Seattle felt…contained.  I needed a serious reset, and the idea of a solo road trip started to feel less like a dream and more like a necessity.  I’m picturing a quick getaway – maybe a stretch of the coast, or even just a few hours north.
