"As I binge-watched Succession in 2020, I found myself pondering Logan Roy's erratic behavior. Was he manipulating his family or showing signs of declining health? It got me thinking - how often do we misinterpret the actions of those around us? I realized that, just like Logan, our loved ones can exhibit behaviors that are both hurtful and a cry for help. It's a reminder to approach others with empathy, not just judgment."
