The world felt like it was holding its breath in 2020. With everything shut down and the days blurring into one another, I found myself sitting in a silence I could no longer outrun. My usual distractions—the crowded bars, the late-night parties—were gone. It was just me, my four walls, and a growing, uncomfortable truth: I needed to get sober.

In that quiet, two unexpected guides found me. The first was a book, Brené Brown’s *Daring Greatly*, its spine staring at me from my neglected bookshelf. I’d always thought vulnerability was a weakness, a messy emotion to be avoided at all costs. But Brené argued it was the birthplace of courage. As I read, I started to see my own story reflected back—not in the addiction itself, but in the mountain of **shame** I carried because of it. I had built walls to keep people from seeing the ‘real’ me, the one who struggled. Sobriety, I was learning, wasn't about building higher walls; it was about having the courage to take them down, brick by painful brick.

My second guide arrived in the form of the Rose family on *Schitt's Creek*. In their journey from riches to rags, I saw a hilarious, tender blueprint for **personal growth**. They were stripped of everything they thought defined them and were forced to be vulnerable with each other. David, in particular, with his guarded heart and sharp wit slowly softening, showed me that connection and acceptance were possible, even after a lifetime of building defenses. Watching them learn to be a family without their wealth mirrored my own journey of learning to be a person without alcohol.

My **recovery** in 2020 became a quiet, deliberate practice in **vulnerability**. It was telling a friend I wasn’t okay. It was admitting I was scared. It was sitting with the discomfort instead of numbing it. And in that space, I found a strength I never knew I had. The world may have been falling apart, but for the first time, I was finally, truly, building myself back up.
