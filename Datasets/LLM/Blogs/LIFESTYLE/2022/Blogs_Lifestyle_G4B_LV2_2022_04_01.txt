**Galapagos Dreams & Midwestern Realities**

Okay, let's be honest – 2022 felt like a year of big decisions, didn’t it? And I’ve been wrestling with one in particular: wanderlust versus…well, reality.  I just got back from the Galapagos, and seriously, it blew my mind. Turquoise waters, bizarre wildlife, a feeling of being utterly *remote* – it was everything I’d dreamed of. 

But then, staring at my bank account, the thought crept in: could I *actually* swing an extravagant international trip right now? It felt a little overwhelming.  

That’s when I started daydreaming about something different. Something closer to home.  I realized that the magic of travel isn’t always about passport stamps and exotic locales.  Maybe it’s about discovering the beauty hidden in unexpected places – like a really amazing hiking trail just a few hours’ drive away. 

It’s making me think about embracing Midwestern adventures, and maybe even some seriously good outdoor activities.  What about you? Are you craving a grand escape, or are you finding joy in exploring your own backyard?
