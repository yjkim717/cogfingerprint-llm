That UCAS form felt like a final verdict in 2022. My predicted AAC grades stared back, a permanent label. I almost didn't apply to my dream university, convinced I wasn't "top-tier" enough. But I did. And you know what? That application was less about three letters and more about my storyâ€”the late nights, the passion for my subject. It taught me that potential isn't just a grade; it's the fire you bring. Don't let a prediction limit your ambition.
