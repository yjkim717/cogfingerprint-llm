There I was in late 2022, deep into my 3D printing obsession, when I hit a familiar wall. My Klipper setup on the Raspberry Pi was flawless, until a print needed a pause command for me to manually embed nuts. The machine would just stop, silently. I’d wander back hours later to a cold, failed project. It struck me then—this need for a clear signal for user intervention is a lot like life. We all need better alerts for when we should pause and engage, not just automate on autopilot.
