### The One Thing I'm Not Skimping On for Our Small Wedding

Let’s be real—planning a wedding in 2022 feels like a financial obstacle course. Every time I check another item off our list, my budget spreadsheet winces. We decided on an intimate wedding early on, which helped us say a firm "no" to a lot of things. But there was one area where my frugal heart and my sentimental heart got into a tug-of-war: the photographer.

At first, I balked. The quotes made my eyes water. I thought, "It's just one day, and we'll have our phones, right?" But then I looked at our engagement photos.

That session was more than just a photoshoot; it was a trial run. Our photographer didn't just pose us; she helped us forget the camera was there. She captured the way my fiancé laughs when I try to be serious, and the genuine, un-staged joy we felt. Those images are our first family heirlooms.

So, I’ve re-framed my thinking. This isn't a line item for "pictures." It's an investment in our memory. The décor will be taken down, the cake will be eaten, but the photos are what we’ll hold when the whirlwind of the day is a beautiful, distant blur. For our small, heartfelt day, I want to ensure those feelings are preserved with the same care and intention we’re putting into every other detail. The photographer isn't a vendor; they're the storyteller.
