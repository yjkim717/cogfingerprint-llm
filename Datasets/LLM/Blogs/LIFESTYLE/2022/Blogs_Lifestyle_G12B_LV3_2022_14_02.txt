## The Miles Between Meetings: Ultrarunning, Travel, and the Search for Balance

It's 2022, and if you're anything like me, the word "balance" feels less like a serene yoga pose and more like a constantly shifting tightrope walk. I’ve spent the last few years building a career I love, one that often demands a lot – long hours, intense focus, and, increasingly, travel. And then there’s the other love of my life: ultrarunning. The dirt, the challenge, the sheer stubbornness of putting one foot in front of the other for hours on end… it's a core part of who I am.

But lately, these two worlds have been colliding in a way that's left me feeling a little...lost. The travel has ramped up. A week here, a few days there, hopping across time zones – it’s exhilarating, yes, but also exhausting. And the guilt? The guilt is a beast of its own. Every time I'm away, I feel like I'm letting my training slip.

The question swirling around in my head is a simple one: do I pause my training entirely when these travel periods hit? Or do I try to squeeze in runs, knowing they'll likely be shorter, less structured, and probably feel like a frantic attempt to tick a box?

There's a part of me that wants to just *stop*. To acknowledge the reality that consistent, high-quality training simply isn’t possible when I'm living out of a suitcase. But then the other part of me – the runner – feels a pang of panic. The fear of losing momentum, of losing *that* feeling of being strong and connected to my body.

I’ve realized there's no easy answer. It's not about finding a perfect solution, because frankly, perfection is a myth. It’s about finding a sustainable rhythm. Maybe it's accepting that some weeks will be all about recovery, about prioritizing sleep and nutrition over mileage. Maybe it's about finding those little pockets of time – a quick trail run near the hotel, a walk during a conference break – and making the most of them.

It's about being kind to myself, understanding that life isn't a linear progression. It’s about adapting, adjusting, and remembering *why* I run in the first place: for the joy of it, for the challenge, and for the incredible clarity it brings to my life, even when that life feels a little chaotic. Anyone else battling this same struggle? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
