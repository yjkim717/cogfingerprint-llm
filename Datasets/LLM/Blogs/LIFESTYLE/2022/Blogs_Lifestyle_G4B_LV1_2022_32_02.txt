**Chasing Auto-Scores and Finding My Flow**

2022 felt… intense. I dove headfirst into Epic Seven, specifically obsessed with optimizing my RGB teams for those sweet, sweet auto-expo scores. It started as a challenge, a way to measure my progress and, honestly, a little competitive streak. I spent hours tweaking, analyzing, and experimenting with “light expo” builds – essentially, aiming for the fastest possible score with a streamlined team. 

I even built a whole collection of “expo teams,” meticulously documenting each RGB combination and its auto performance. There was a satisfying, almost addictive, quality to the “speed tuning” process. But you know what? I realized I was missing the point. 

The constant chasing of numbers left me feeling drained. I started to appreciate the *process* of building those teams, the experimentation, and the small victories – not just the final score. It was a reminder that sometimes, the journey is more rewarding than the destination.
