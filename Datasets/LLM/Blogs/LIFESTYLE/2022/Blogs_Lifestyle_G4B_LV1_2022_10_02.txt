**The Echo in My Head**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How the mind can just… loop. Like a scratched record stuck on a particularly awful part. Lately, mine’s been stuck on a dark, familiar groove – a replay of the ‘what if’s’ surrounding alcohol. 

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of fragile victories. I’d been sober for six months, and most days were genuinely good. But then, out of nowhere, this insidious little voice would start. It wasn’t a shouted command, more like a quiet, insistent whisper: *“Just one drink. It wouldn’t hurt. You deserve it.”* 

And with that whisper came the shame. A tidal wave of regret for past choices, a heavy blanket of fear about the potential fallout – the disappointed faces, the broken promises, the feeling of letting myself down. It’s exhausting, really. 

I started noticing these loops more and more, especially when stressed. A tough deadline at work, a frustrating conversation with my partner… suddenly, the craving felt just *inches* away. 

I realized I needed to build a shield against these echoes. It’s not about denying the feelings, but about acknowledging them without letting them hijack my decision-making.  I’ve started focusing on grounding techniques – deep breaths, a quick walk, even just naming the feeling (“Okay, I’m feeling shame right now”) - to pull myself back from the edge. 

Recovery isn’t linear, and these moments will probably keep happening. But I’m learning that recognizing the loop is the first step to breaking free from it.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the original summary (like shame, for example)?
