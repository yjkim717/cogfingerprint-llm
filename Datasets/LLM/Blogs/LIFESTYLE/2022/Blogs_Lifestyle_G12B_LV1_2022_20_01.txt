>## The Gray Magic That Backfired (And What I Learned)

Okay, confession time. I attempted a DIY root touch-up this week. Blonde hair and stubborn grays? It's a constant battle. I thought I was being clever, grabbing Ardell Gray Magic – everyone online raved about it! But, lesson learned: a little goes a *long* way. 

Now my roots are radiating a definite orange hue. Not the cool, trendy copper, just… orange. It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, the easiest solutions aren't always the best. I'm hoping it fades quickly, and in the meantime, embracing the slightly tangerine vibe. It’s definitely a story for the books! #hairdye #diyfail #2022hair
