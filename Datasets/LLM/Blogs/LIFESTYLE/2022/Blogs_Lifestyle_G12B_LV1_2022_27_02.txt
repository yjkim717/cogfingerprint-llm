## The Weight of Unspoken Things

It’s funny how some things just hang in the air, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about unspoken expectations, especially within families. A close friend is facing a huge moment – deciding when and how to share a deeply personal truth with her family. She's from a prominent Indian business family, the kind where tradition and reputation are everything. 

It’s 2022, and yet, navigating LGBTQ+ identity within conservative communities in India still feels like walking a tightrope. Seeing her anxiety has really hit home. It’s a reminder that even with progress, so many are carrying this weight – the fear of disappointing loved ones, of disrupting a carefully constructed image. I’m sending her all the strength, and hoping for a path forward that honors both her truth and her family’s complexities.
