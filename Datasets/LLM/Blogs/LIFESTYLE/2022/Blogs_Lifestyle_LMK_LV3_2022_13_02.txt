"As I sat coding on my Windows 11 machine in 2022, I found myself pondering the perfect GUI library for my Rust projects. The quest for a seamless user interface led me down a rabbit hole of exploring AppKit, GTK4, and Win32 bindings. I realized that, just like crafting a beautiful GUI, curating a lifestyle requires attention to detail and the right tools. By embracing the right 'libraries' - be it productivity hacks or mindfulness practices - we can build a life that's as elegant as a well-designed app."
