There’s something quietly rebellious about choosing a road trip close to home in 2022, when the world was shouting about far-flung destinations. I’d spent months dreaming of international flights, but my bank account and calendar had other ideas. So, I turned my gaze inward, to the sprawling, underrated Midwest.

What I found was a lesson in simplicity. My days became a rhythm of dusty trails, serene lakes perfect for a solo kayak, and bike paths winding through golden fields. It wasn’t about ticking a famous landmark off a list; it was about the crunch of gravel under my tires and the profound silence of a forest I never knew existed just a few hours from my doorstep. This domestic adventure taught me that grandeur isn’t always measured in passport stamps, but in the depth of the experience right outside your door.
