**The Tiny Wins That Built My 2022**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt…big. A year of big decisions, big anxieties, and a whole lot of feeling overwhelmed. I spent so much time staring at the summit of my goals – the ‘future’ – that I completely missed the ground beneath my feet. I was waiting for the *perfect* moment to start, convinced that a grand, sweeping plan was the only way forward.

Then, I realized I was doing the opposite of moving. I was stuck in analysis paralysis. 

It was a small shift, really. Focusing on one tiny, actionable thing *today*.  Instead of “write a novel,” it became “write 200 words.” Instead of “get in shape,” it was “walk for 15 minutes.”  These little bursts of action, fueled by the simple idea of “now,” started to create a surprising amount of momentum. 

I discovered that consistent, daily progress – even if it felt minuscule – was far more effective than sporadic bursts of ambition. It wasn't about leaping to the top; it was about taking one step, then another, and another. 

Looking back, those small wins – the completed tasks, the moments of movement – are what truly shaped my year.  They taught me that success isn’t a destination, it’s the continuous, beautiful act of showing up, one tiny action at a time.  What’s your ‘today’ going to be?
