### The Tightrope Walk: Loving My Tween and the Silence After Covid

I remember the before-times. The playdates that would stretch for hours, the constant hum of little voices in the living room. Fast forward to 2022, and the silence in our house is sometimes deafening. My son, Leo, turned twelve this year, and the social, chatty kid I once knew seems to have retreated into a quiet shell.

The real struggle, the one that keeps me up at night, isn’t just the quiet. It’s the group activity resistance. Where I used to get a cheerful “Sure!” for a soccer game or a birthday party, I’m now met with a wall of “I’d rather not.” It’s a dance of negotiation that often ends in frustration for us both. I see the flyer for the school’s coding club—a structured, safe setting—and my heart leaps. “Look, Leo, you love this stuff!” But his shoulders just slump. The pandemic didn’t just steal two years; it rewired his comfort zone, making the unstructured chaos of group settings feel overwhelming.

This is the tightrope every parent of his generation seems to be walking. How do I balance my deep, unconditional acceptance of the person he is becoming with my burning desire to gently nudge him back into the world? I don’t want to force him, to become the manager of his social life. But I also don’t want him to look back and regret the connections he missed.

So, we’re taking baby steps. A one-on-one hangout instead of a big party. A family board game night to practice the rhythm of turn-taking. I’m learning to listen more to his “why” behind the “no.” It’s a lesson in patience, for sure. Some days it feels like we’re building a new bridge, brick by tiny brick, back to a world he’s still relearning how to trust.
