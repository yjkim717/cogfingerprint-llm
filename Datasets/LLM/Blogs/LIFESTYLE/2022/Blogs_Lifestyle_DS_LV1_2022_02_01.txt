### The Bubble Gum Battle: A Lesson in Letting Go

I thought the bubble gum flavor would be the hero of this story. When the pediatrician handed over the bright pink antibiotic for my seven-month-old, I pictured him gulping it down with a gummy smile. Oh, the naivety of 2022! The reality was a sticky, pink warzone. Every dose was a masterclass in infant jiu-jitsu—a headlock, a gentle squirt, and then… the dreaded *pffft*. A perfect arc of bubble-gum medicine would decorate the wall behind us.

My kitchen counter became a lab of desperate experiments. I tried mixing it with a spoonful of pureed pears. I tried the little syringe aimed at the inner cheek. I even considered the “mix it in the bottle” trick I’d read about online, but everything felt like a form of force-feeding, and the guilt was heavier than the medicine bottle itself.

One particularly frazzled evening, after the third failed attempt, I just stopped. I put the syringe down, took a deep breath, and held my son close. He looked at me, his little brow furrowed, and I realized he wasn’t being difficult; he was communicating. He hated the fake, cloying sweetness.

The lesson wasn’t about winning the battle of the bottle. It was about surrendering the idea of perfect control. We eventually found our rhythm with tiny doses followed immediately by his favorite teething cracker—a messy, imperfect, but peaceful truce. Sometimes, the sweetest victories in parenting come from letting go of the bubble-gum dream and just meeting your baby where they are.
