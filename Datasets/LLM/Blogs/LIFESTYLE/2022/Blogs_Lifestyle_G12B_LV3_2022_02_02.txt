## The Future of Money and My Coffee Run

Remember back in 2022 when everyone was buzzing about cryptocurrency? I got caught up in the hype too, imagining a future where I could pay for my morning coffee with Ethereum. Sounds cool, right? But the more I thought about it, the less practical it seemed. 

These digital currencies felt more like investments, fluctuating wildly and bringing with them a whole load of tax implications. Could I really risk the value of my coins changing between ordering and paying? It felt a bit stressful! 

That’s when I started noticing stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar. Maybe *that’s* the bridge between digital currency and everyday life. Still feels a little futuristic, but a lot less anxiety-inducing than my ETH coffee run!
