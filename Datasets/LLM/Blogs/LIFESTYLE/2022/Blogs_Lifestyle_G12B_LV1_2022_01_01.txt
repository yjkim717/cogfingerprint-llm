## My Fragrance Journey: Three Months In

It’s wild how quickly time flies! I just realized it’s been three months since I really dove into building a fragrance collection. It started as a simple curiosity, but now I’m genuinely obsessed. Millesime Imperial has become an absolute go-to – the warmth is just *chef's kiss*. I've been experimenting, of course, and let's just say, not every scent is a winner. CDNIM, for example, didn't quite click with me. It's all part of the process, right? Exploring, discovering, and finding those signature scents that just *feel* like you. Anyone else obsessed with fragrance?
