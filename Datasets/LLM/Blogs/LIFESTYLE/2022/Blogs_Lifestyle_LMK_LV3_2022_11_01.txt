"Rebooting Reality: A Lesson in Digital Harmony. As I fired up my openSUSE Leap system in 2022, I was eager to dive into my daily browsing routine. But, to my dismay, launching Firefox immediately after rebooting caused my system to freeze, bringing my productivity to a grinding halt. This frustrating experience made me realize the importance of finding a balance between technology and workflow. By simply waiting a few minutes after rebooting before opening Firefox, I was able to avoid the system freeze and enjoy a smoother Gnome experience. It's a small adjustment that has taught me to be more mindful of my digital habits."
