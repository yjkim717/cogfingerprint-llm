**Maintaining Momentum: How I Kept Running Through Work Travel and Exhaustion in 2022**

As I sit here reflecting on my running journey in 2022, I'm reminded of the countless times I had to adapt my training to accommodate my demanding work schedule. As an ultrarunner, I'm no stranger to pushing my body to its limits, but there were times when my job seemed to be working against me. With frequent long-haul flights, back-to-back meetings, and endless hotel stays, it's a wonder I didn't lose my running habit altogether.

I vividly remember one particularly grueling stretch in the spring when I was in the midst of training for a 50-miler. My work schedule was chaotic, with a week-long trip to Europe looming on the horizon. I was worried that I'd have to sacrifice my hard-earned training miles, but I was determined to find a way to make it work.

I started by packing my running gear in my carry-on luggage (much to the amusement of my colleagues) and doing research on the run-friendly destinations on my itinerary. I discovered hidden gems – parks, trails, and scenic routes that I might have otherwise missed. On rest days, I'd take a leisurely jog around the hotel's neighborhood, exploring the local culture and taking in the sights.

Of course, it wasn't always easy. There were days when exhaustion got the better of me, and I had to settle for a gentle shuffle instead of a proper run. But I learned to listen to my body and be kind to myself, even when my training plan went out the window.

One of the most surprising discoveries I made during this time was the importance of flexibility. By being open to new running routes and adapting my training to suit my environment, I actually found that I was able to maintain my fitness level (and even improve in some areas). It was a valuable lesson that extended beyond running, too – being flexible and resilient has helped me navigate the ups and downs of life with greater ease.

As I look back on 2022, I'm proud of the way I managed to balance my love of running with the demands of my job. It's not always easy, but it's worth it – and I'm already looking forward to the next adventure. Whether you're a fellow ultrarunner or just starting out, I hope my experiences can offer some inspiration: with a bit of creativity and determination, you can keep your fitness on track, no matter what life throws your way.
