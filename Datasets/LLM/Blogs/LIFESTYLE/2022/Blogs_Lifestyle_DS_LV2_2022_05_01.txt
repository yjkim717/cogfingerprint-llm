### The Five-Minute Boot and the Art of Patience

It started with a simple goal: a faster computer. I’d invested in a sleek new M.2 drive, the kind of hardware that promises near-instant everything. I meticulously cloned my old drive, slotted the new one in, and pressed the power button, ready for a new era of speed.

Instead, I was greeted by a black screen that felt like it lasted an eternity.

My sleek new machine was taking over five minutes to boot. Five minutes! I’d stare at the BIOS screen, my coffee getting cold, my morning momentum stalling. I felt betrayed. I’d upgraded to save time, but I was suddenly drowning in it. My initial frustration was a hot, impatient thing. I dove back into the BIOS, toggling boot priorities, glaring at the “UEFI Windows Boot Manager” like it was personally mocking me.

But in that forced stillness, something shifted. Those five minutes became an unexpected pocket of quiet. No pings, no notifications, just me and my own thoughts. I’d watch the progress bar crawl and, instead of fuming, I’d take a deliberate sip of coffee, look out the window, or just breathe.

I finally solved it—a deep BIOS setting needed a tweak—and now my PC boots in seconds. It’s wonderfully fast. But sometimes, I miss those five minutes. The upgrade gave me back time, but the troubleshooting gifted me a moment of pause I didn't know I needed. It was a 2022 reminder that sometimes, the solution isn’t just about fixing the machine, but about resetting ourselves.
