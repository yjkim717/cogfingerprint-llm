>## The Promise of Seamless Tech & The Reality of Fine Print

Okay, so I finally did it. I jumped on the Google bandwagon this fall. New Pixel 7 and a Pixel Watch – I was *living* the seamless tech dream. I’d been resisting for years, clinging to my older phone, but the promises of Google’s ecosystem were just too tempting. 

The Google Store made it all seem so incredibly easy. Trade in your old devices, get a sweet credit towards your shiny new ones. Sounds fantastic, right? 

Well, it wasn't quite as fantastic as advertised. Turns out, the trade-in credit only applied to the *phone*. The Watch? Nada. Zilch. I spent a good hour on the phone trying to unravel the fine print, feeling a growing sense of frustration. It wasn't a huge amount of money, but the principle of it felt off. 

It’s a small thing, really. But it's a reminder that even the most appealing promises often come with hidden clauses. Sometimes, the seamless experience is just a carefully crafted illusion. Now, I'm just hoping I can find a decent place to sell my old smartwatch!
