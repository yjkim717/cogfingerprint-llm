### The Intersection

That yellow light flashing in the 2022 dusk wasn't just a traffic signal; it was a metaphor for my whole side-hustle life. Go, but be cautious. Hurry, but don't crash. As a Doordash driver, I was constantly calculating risk versus reward.

Then came the intersection with the other car. The crunch of metal was deafening, but the silence after was worse. In that stunned moment, my mind didn't race to insurance companies or fault. It went to the simple, profound truth we all forget in our hustle: we are fragile. Our plans are built on a foundation that can shatter in an instant.

That flashing light now reminds me to slow down, not just at crossings, but in life. The destination can wait. The journey is what matters.
