There’s a moment every angler knows—the sudden, electric pull on the line that sets your heart racing. For me, it happened last fall at Bob Sikes Cut, just as the outgoing tide began to rush. I’d tied my braid with what I thought was the perfect knot, confident and ready. Then, it struck: a powerful snook, surging against the current, testing every inch of my setup.

For a few breathless seconds, we were locked in a dance of strength and will. But with one fierce run, the line snapped, and my favorite lure vanished into the murky water. I was left with just the memory—the thrill, the near-miss, and the humbling reminder that nature doesn’t hand out guarantees. Even in 2022, with all our gear and knowledge, some escapes are just meant to be.
