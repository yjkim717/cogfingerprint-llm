## The Never-Ending Bath Mat Saga (and My Roomba's Disapproval)

Okay, real talk: keeping a clean bathroom is a constant battle. Lately, it’s been a bath mat battle. I’m on Reddit, desperately seeking advice! I need something washable, ideally microfiber (though my last attempt was a fluffy disaster), and *absolutely* Roomba-friendly. Apparently, latex bottoms are a major no-no. It's 2022, shouldn't finding a decent bath mat be easier? Send help (and recommendations)!
