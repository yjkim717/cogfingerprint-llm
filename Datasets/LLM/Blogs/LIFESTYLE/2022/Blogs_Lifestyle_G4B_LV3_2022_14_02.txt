**The Tightrope Walk: Running and a Relentless Schedule**

2022 felt… chaotic, didn’t it? For me, it was a year of chasing a huge promotion at work, which meant a *lot* more travel. Suddenly, my carefully crafted ultrarunning training schedule – something I’d built for consistency and joy – felt like it was constantly on the verge of collapse. 

I’d arrive at a new city, energized for a run, only to be slammed with back-to-back meetings and client dinners. The guilt of letting my training slip was a heavy weight.  It forced me to really examine what “fitness” meant to me. Was it just about hitting specific mileage, or was it about the *feeling* of moving my body, of pushing my limits? 

Ultimately, I learned that true consistency isn’t about rigid adherence to a plan, but about finding pockets of movement wherever I could – a brisk walk during a conference, a quick hotel gym session. It’s a constant balancing act, and honestly, it’s made me appreciate the small victories even more.

Would you like me to tweak this draft or create a different version based on a specific angle you’d like to explore (e.g., focusing more on the mental challenge, or offering a specific practical tip)?
