### The Movie in My Mind: My Secret Weapon Against Cravings

It’s a Tuesday evening in late 2022. The workday is finally over, and a familiar, gnawing feeling starts to creep in from the edges of my mind. It’s not quite a thought, more of a deep-seated whisper: *Wouldn’t a glass of wine just… fix this?*

A few years ago, that whisper would have been a command. I’d have already been halfway to the store, my brain already conjuring the fizzy relief of that first sip. But today, I do something different. I close my eyes, and I press play on the movie in my mind.

This is what we call “playing the tape forward” in my recovery program, and it’s the single most powerful tool in my sobriety toolkit. It’s not about denying the initial, false promise of comfort that a drink offers. It’s about honestly watching the sequel.

So, I let the reel roll.

The first glass of wine doesn’t stop there. It’s a slippery slope, and the movie fast-forwards. One glass becomes a bottle. The pleasant buzz becomes a foggy numbness. The relaxation I was seeking? It’s gone, replaced by a restless anxiety. I see myself getting irritable with my partner over something trivial. The book I was looking forward to reading sits unopened. The evening I wanted to reclaim is stolen, replaced by a hazy void.

The tape keeps going. I see the next morning—the pounding headache, the self-loathing, the “why did I do that?” echoing in a dry mouth. I see the shame of having to reset my sobriety counter, a number I’ve worked so hard to build. I see the disappointed look in my dog’s eyes because I’m too hungover to take him for our morning walk.

It’s not a dramatic horror film; it’s a mundane tragedy. It’s the loss of a thousand small, good things for one fleeting, deceptive moment.

When I open my eyes, the craving has lost its power. It’s been exposed as a liar. The choice is no longer between “drink” and “not drink.” It’s between a predictable, fulfilling evening and that entire depressing movie I just directed, starred in, and had to suffer through.

This practice has done more than just keep me sober; it has reframed my entire life. It forces a moment of pause, a moment of radical honesty. And in that pause, I find immense gratitude. I’m grateful for the program that taught me this skill, and for the incredible people in the StopDrinking community online who remind me daily that I’m not alone in this fight.

Their stories are my story. Their struggles are my struggles. And their victories, no matter how small, feel like my own.

So tonight, I’ll make a cup of tea, take my dog for that walk a little early, and soak in the crisp autumn air. I’ll be present for my life, not just a passenger in it. And for that, I am endlessly thankful.
