**The Quiet Joy of Letting Go**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Being a foster parent to a rabbit – it’s supposed to be all fluffy cuddles and happy endings. But last month, I watched Pipkin, my little foster bunny, finally find his forever home with the Millers. Honestly, it was… bittersweet. 

There was a definite pang of sadness seeing him go, a little emotional distress for me, I won’t lie. But then I remembered *why* I do this. It’s about giving these sweethearts a chance, a safe space to blossom before they find their perfect family.  Seeing him happily munching clover in his new yard? That’s a good kind of joy, a quiet one.  Bunny bonding is amazing, but watching them thrive elsewhere is even better.
