As I upgraded my kitchen with an Amazon Echo Show 15 in 2022, I realized it could be more than just a smart display. I wanted to turn it into an electronic cookbook! I discovered I could use the Silk browser to access my favorite recipes. To make it more convenient, I imported my bookmarks, making meal planning a breeze. Now, my Echo Show is a kitchen staple, streamlining my cooking routine like never before.
