## My Echo Show & The Quest for Familiar Flavors

Okay, so I finally caved and got an Echo Show 15 – it's gorgeous! But transferring my digital life has been…an adventure. Specifically, my recipe bookmarks! I’m trying to get them into Silk browser, and it's proving trickier than I thought. Anyone else wrestling with tech transitions? Hoping I can recreate my virtual cookbook soon – comfort food memories are too important to lose! #EchoShow15 #SilkBrowser #TechLife2022
