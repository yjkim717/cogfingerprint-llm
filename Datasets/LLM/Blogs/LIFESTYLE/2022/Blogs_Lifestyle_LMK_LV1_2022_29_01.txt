"Planning our intimate wedding in 2022 was a whirlwind experience. As we navigated the process, my fiancé and I found ourselves questioning how to allocate our budget effectively. One of the biggest decisions was how much to invest in a photographer to capture our special day. We were hosting a 6-hour event with close family and friends, and we wanted to ensure we had beautiful memories to cherish. After seeking advice from friends and fellow couples, we realized that hiring a photographer for the full six hours would be a significant cost. We decided to prioritize our spending and also hired a wedding planner to help us stay organized. We also fell in love with our engagement photos, which became a deciding factor in choosing our photographer. In the end, it was worth every penny – those photos will be treasured forever."
