## Trading Brick for Wheels: A Sober Vanlife Dream in a Chaotic World (2022)

The hum of the refrigerator is the only sound right now. It’s a comforting, mundane noise in a world that feels anything *but* comforting. 2022. Honestly, who could have predicted *this*? Inflation soaring, political unrest bubbling, a lingering pandemic… it feels like we’re all just trying to keep our heads above water. And me? I’m dreaming of a van.

Yeah, I know. It sounds… whimsical. Maybe even a little irresponsible. Especially when you consider the backdrop of everything else going on. But hear me out. This isn’t some impulsive Instagram-fueled fantasy. This is a carefully considered, deeply felt desire rooted in a need for something… different. Something *more*.

For those who don’t know me, my story isn’t a simple one. A few years back, I found myself tangled in the messy, suffocating grip of addiction. It took hitting rock bottom – a place I wouldn’t wish on anyone – to finally start the long, arduous climb back to sobriety. And I’m proud to say, I’m here. I’m stable. I’m working a program that works. But the scars remain. The anxieties linger. And the desire for a life lived on *my* terms, a life free from the constraints and triggers of the past, burns brighter than ever.

Pictures of sun-drenched landscapes, cozy interiors, and smiling faces filled my screen. At first, I dismissed it as another curated online illusion. But the more I looked, the more something resonated. It wasn’t just about the aesthetics; it was about the *freedom*. The freedom to wake up wherever you choose, to explore without boundaries, to create a life that truly aligns with your values.

And for me, a recovering addict, that freedom feels… essential.

The traditional path – the 9-to-5 grind, the mortgage, the societal expectations – it all felt like a cage. Not because those things are inherently bad, but because they felt like a constant reminder of the life I almost lost. A life dictated by external pressures, by the need to conform, by the fear of judgment. I needed to break free from that cycle, to create a space where I could focus on my recovery, on my personal growth, and on building a life that felt authentically *mine*.

So, I started researching. Van conversions, stealth camping, remote work… the rabbit hole is deep, and honestly, a little overwhelming. But the more I learned, the more excited
