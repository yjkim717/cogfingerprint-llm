**The Weight of a New Map**

2022 felt… weighty, didn’t it? For a lot of us, it was a year of big questions, of realizing we weren’t quite where we thought we’d be. I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately, particularly after reading about a young software engineer grappling with the idea of a completely different life – higher education, a move abroad, a career leap. 

It’s a daunting prospect, isn’t it?  Suddenly, the familiar comfort of your routine feels miles away.  I remember feeling that way myself a few years back, considering a career shift and the possibility of international work.  There’s a strange mix of excitement and sheer terror when you start charting a course into the unknown.  It’s about trusting yourself, even when the map feels blank.  Sending a huge vote of encouragement to anyone feeling that weight – you’ve got this.
