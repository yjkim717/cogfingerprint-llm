### The Wallet That Wasn't

I remember the moment in early 2022 when I felt like I was living in the future. I’d finally set up a digital wallet, loaded it with a trendy cryptocurrency, and was ready to buy my morning coffee with something other than a crumpled banknote. I felt financially independent, a true digital pioneer.

That feeling lasted about a week.

The problem wasn't the technology; it was my own anxiety. I’d watch the value of my "coffee money" swing wildly on my phone. One day, that flat white cost me $4. The next, the same amount of crypto was theoretically worth $6.50. Was I being savvy, or was I accidentally overspending on a latte? The volatility was exhausting.

I quickly realized my crypto wasn't a practical payment method; it was a speculative asset wearing a payment’s disguise. The dream of a seamless, decentralized lifestyle crumbled under the weight of constant calculation and the looming dread of creating a "taxable event" with every sip. I’ve since retreated to the boring predictability of stablecoins and traditional banking for daily life. My foray into crypto taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, the most revolutionary tool for your lifestyle is the one that doesn’t give you a headache before 9 AM.
