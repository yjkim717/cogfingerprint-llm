## Finding My Canvas Again

It’s funny how much space something can take up, and how much space is left when it’s gone. For me, that “something” was a reliance on alcohol, and the space left behind in 2022 has been… surprising. Initially, it was just relief. Then, slowly, a quiet curiosity started to bloom. 

I’d always loved to paint, but it felt like a distant memory, buried under layers of routine and, well, other things. This year, I dusted off the brushes. It's messy, imperfect, and utterly *mine*.  It’s a reminder that recovery isn’t just about stopping something, it's about rediscovering the things that make you, you. Anyone else finding unexpected joys in reclaiming their passions?
