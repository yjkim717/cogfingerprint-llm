As I dive into Hearts of Iron 4, I'm reminded that life is like a game scenario - full of choices and historical paths. In 2022, we're constantly seeking control, just like I am when playing as the Soviet Union. But what if we applied that same desire for agency to our real lives? By embracing the complexity of our own 'game mods,' we can forge our own paths and rise to challenges. It's a reflection that has me rethinking my lifestyle and the choices I make every day.
