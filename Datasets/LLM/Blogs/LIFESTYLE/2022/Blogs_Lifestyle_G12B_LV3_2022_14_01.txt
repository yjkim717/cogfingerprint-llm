## The Amex Trap & a Debt-Free Dream

Okay, real talk. I did something a little… impulsive last month. While I was actually making real progress on chipping away at my debt – a HUGE win, I might add – I caved and opened an American Express card. The allure of the rewards was strong, I know, we've all been there. But now, looking back in late 2022, I'm questioning it.

Was it a smart move to open a new line of credit while actively trying to become debt-free? I saw a Reddit thread the other day with someone asking about closing the card quickly, and it really resonated. I’m now wondering if shutting it down now will hurt my credit more than it helps. Financial responsibility is a tough lesson, and sometimes, it comes with a side of second-guessing! Anyone else been there?
