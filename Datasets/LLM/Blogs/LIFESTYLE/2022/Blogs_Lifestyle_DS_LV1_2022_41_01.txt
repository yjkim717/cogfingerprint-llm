### The Art of Simplicity

Remember that feeling in 2022 when we were all just trying to declutter our lives? I was doing the same with my playlist and realized something. I’d added a new track from a famous rapper, known for his dizzyingly complex rhymes. Yet, a week later, I couldn’t hum a single bar.

It struck me that this is a lot like lifestyle advice. We often over-complicate things—the perfect morning routine, the most efficient workout. We pack our days with so many intricate steps that the core purpose becomes lost, making the entire effort feel… forgettable.

Sometimes, the most impactful moments, like the most memorable songs, aren’t the most complex. They’re the ones that resonate with a simple, honest truth. I’m now chasing that clear, powerful melody in my daily life, not the lyrical gymnastics.
