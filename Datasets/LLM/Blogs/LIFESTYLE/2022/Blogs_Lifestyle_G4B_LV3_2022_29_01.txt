**Dreaming of Bali: Balancing Tradition and My Wedding Vision**

2022 felt like a year of big decisions, and honestly, my wedding planning has been the biggest one yet! My fiancé and I are dreaming of a family wedding in Indonesia – a beautiful blend of tradition and the stunning landscapes we’ve always loved. But, like many brides, I’m wrestling with the pressure of family expectations. 

Right now, I’m laser-focused on finding *the* photographer.  Seriously, capturing those engagement photos against the backdrop of rice paddies is a top priority. It’s about creating a visual story we’ll cherish forever.  I’m also leaning heavily on online communities for advice – navigating photographer selection in a new country feels daunting!  It’s a delicate balance, isn’t it?  Creating a beautiful day while honoring our roots and sticking to our budget.
