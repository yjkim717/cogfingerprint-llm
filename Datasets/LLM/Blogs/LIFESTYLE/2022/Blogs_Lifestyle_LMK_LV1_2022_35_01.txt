As I cast my line into the Ohio River near Louisville in the summer of 2022, I realized that fishing isn't just about reeling in a catch - it's about embracing a lifestyle. Using a three-way sinker rig with the right bait can make all the difference for dock fishing. I recall the thrill of landing a beauty off the dock, and it made me appreciate the simple joys. For those looking to try their luck, I recommend experimenting with different rigs and baits. The peacefulness of the river is a great way to unwind and connect with nature.
