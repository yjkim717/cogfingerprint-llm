It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my phone, watching my crypto portfolio do its daily rollercoaster routine. One minute, I’m daydreaming about early retirement; the next, I’m wondering if I should’ve just stuck with a savings account. But here’s the thing that’s been nagging at me lately: how am I supposed to use this stuff to actually *buy* anything?

I remember trying to pay for a coffee with Bitcoin last month—sounds futuristic, right? The barista looked at me like I’d just offered to barter with seashells. And honestly, I get it. By the time the transaction cleared, the value had shifted enough that I probably overpaid. It felt less like a smooth payment and more like a high-stakes gamble with my latte on the line.

Then there’s the tax headache. Every trade, every tiny purchase—it all needs to be accounted for. I spent an entire weekend buried in spreadsheets, and I’m still not sure I got it right. It’s hard to imagine crypto becoming part of our daily lifestyle when using it feels like preparing for an IRS audit.

I still believe in the promise of decentralized money, but right now, crypto lives in this weird space. It’s an exciting investment, sure, but as a practical tool for life? We’re just not there yet. And until it finds some stability, my morning coffee will stay on the good old-fashioned debit card.
