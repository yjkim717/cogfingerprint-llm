## The Slow Burn of Japanese (and Life Lately)

Okay, real talk. Anyone else feeling that weird, low-hum anxiety of 2022? Like, the world is… a lot. And fitting in all the things you *want* to do feels impossible. Lately, that's been really hitting me when it comes to Japanese.

I started learning a couple of years ago, fueled by a genuine love of Studio Ghibli and a desire to actually *understand* the subtitles. I got through Genki 1 with gusto, mastered hiragana and katakana (still occasionally stumble, don’t judge!), and felt like I was actually making progress.

Then… life happened. Work got busier, the news cycle got heavier, and suddenly dedicating an hour a day to grammar drills felt… overwhelming. The motivation started to dwindle. I'd open my textbook, feel a wave of guilt, and then close it again, promising to try harder tomorrow. Tomorrow never really came.

It’s frustrating, right? You have this passion, this goal, and then you’re just… stuck. I’ve been trying to shift my perspective. Instead of aiming for some grand, fluent-Japanese future, I’m focusing on tiny wins. Five minutes of Duolingo. Re-reading a familiar page in Genki. Even just recognizing a few kanji on a package of Pocky!

It's not about perfection, it’s about consistency. Maybe it’s a slow burn, but at least it’s a burn. And honestly, in a year where everything feels so unpredictable, finding a little pocket of joy and consistent effort, even in something as seemingly small as learning Japanese, feels pretty good. Anyone else battling the motivation monster? Let me know your strategies!
