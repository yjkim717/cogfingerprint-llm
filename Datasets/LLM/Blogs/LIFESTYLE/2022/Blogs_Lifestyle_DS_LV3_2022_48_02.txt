Three years. That’s how long my partner and I spent house hunting solo, hitting every open house we could. In 2022, we finally asked ourselves: was going it alone worth the emotional toll? The time commitment was immense, a part-time job we hadn’t signed up for. I started wondering if a buyer's agent was more than just a transaction—a partner to share the weight. It’s a deeply personal real estate journey, and sometimes the right help isn't a luxury; it’s a necessity for your peace of mind.
