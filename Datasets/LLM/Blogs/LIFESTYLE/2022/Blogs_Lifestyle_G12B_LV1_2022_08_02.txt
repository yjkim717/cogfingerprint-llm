Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a conversational tone and aiming for ~563 words, with a 2022 context. I've focused on exploring the themes of boundaries, family dynamics, and the slow, sometimes painful, process of building self-esteem amidst challenging relationships.  I've also subtly woven in the recycling/duplex elements as metaphors for letting go and shared spaces.

## The Weight of Dishes (and So Much More)

Okay, let's be real. 2022 has been… a year. Not a *bad* year, not a spectacularly amazing one, but one that’s definitely forced me to confront some things about myself and, well, my family. Specifically, the kind of family dynamics that leave you feeling perpetually drained and questioning your own sanity.

For those who don’t know, my husband and I bought a duplex last spring. A really cute one, honestly. Big windows, a tiny little garden, and the promise of a bit more space. The catch? His mom, bless her heart, moved in with us. 

Now, I want to be clear. I have empathy for anyone navigating multi-generational living. It can be wonderful! It *can* be a beautiful tapestry of shared experiences and support. But ours… ours has been a slow, steady chipping away at my sense of self.

It started small, seemingly innocuous things. “Are you *sure* you’re using enough detergent?” “That’s a really… *interesting* color for the living room.” “Don’t you think you should be saving more for retirement?” Each comment, individually, wasn’t devastating. But woven together, they created this constant hum of… evaluation. Like I was perpetually being judged, not just on my choices, but on my *being*.

And the thing is, it’s not just the comments. It's the subtle (and not-so-subtle) controlling behavior. The rearranging of my meticulously organized pantry. The unsolicited advice on everything from my career to my friendships. The way she’d ‘help’ with dinner, taking over the entire process and then subtly implying my methods were inefficient.

It’s enmeshment, I think. That’s a word I’ve been learning about a lot lately. It describes a family system where boundaries are blurred, and individual identities become intertwined. It feels like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, trying to anticipate her reactions, trying to avoid triggering another… discussion.

Honestly, for a while, I internalized it. I started questioning myself. *Maybe* I *am* being reckless with my finances. *Maybe* my organizational skills *are* lacking. *Maybe* I’m just being overly sensitive. The self-esteem took a real nosedive.

The duplex itself became a metaphor for this whole situation. We were supposed to be sharing a space, but it felt more like she was trying to absorb mine. It felt like my identity was being slowly recycled into hers.

But something shifted this fall. I started reading about boundaries. Really studying them. It felt incredibly radical, almost selfish, to think about prioritizing my own needs and mental well-being. But the alternative – continuing down this path of self-doubt and resentment – was even less appealing.
