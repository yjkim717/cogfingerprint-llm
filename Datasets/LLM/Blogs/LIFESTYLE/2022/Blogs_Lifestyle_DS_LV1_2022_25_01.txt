**The Intersection That Changed Everything**

That little flashing red light in the rain last October is a moment forever burned into my memory. One second I was focused on my Doordash delivery, the next, a blur of headlights from the cross-street—who had a flashing yellow—t-boned my car. The sound of crumpling metal is a sound you don’t forget.

In the dazed aftermath, a new kind of stress began. The other driver was pointing fingers, and suddenly I was thrust into a world of insurance claims and fault determination. It’s a strange, unsettling feeling when your livelihood as a gig worker hinges on a traffic signal’s interpretation. That accident did more than just damage my car; it made me reflect on the fragility of the "hustle" lifestyle. It was a harsh 2022 reminder that sometimes, life forces you to slow down, even when you’re racing against the clock.
