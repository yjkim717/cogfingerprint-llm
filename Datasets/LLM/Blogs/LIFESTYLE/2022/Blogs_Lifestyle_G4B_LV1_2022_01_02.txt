**The Year I Became Obsessed with Layering (and Maybe a Little Bit of Gourmand)**

2022 felt… layered, didn’t it? Like everyone else, I was trying to navigate a world that was still a little shaky, a little uncertain. And honestly, I found myself seeking comfort in the smallest, most deliberate details. One of those details became an obsession: fragrance. 

It started subtly. I’d always appreciated a nice scent, but it wasn't until I stumbled across a particularly passionate fragrance review – someone, nightlovell12, I think – dissecting twenty different perfumes, that it really clicked. Suddenly, fragrance wasn’t just something pretty; it was a story, a mood, a tiny, wearable landscape. 

I began experimenting, not with a grand collection, but with building layers. I wasn’t necessarily aiming for 'the best' perfume, but rather, the *right* perfume for a particular moment. There was a surprising amount of research involved, digging into notes – amber, vanilla, even that often-maligned ambroxan. I discovered a real fascination with gourmand fragrances; those that smell like dessert, like warm chocolate or caramel.  It felt decadent, a little rebellious, considering everything else was…well, 2022. 

I found myself pairing a crisp citrus burst with a softer, muskier base, or layering a spicy cardamom with a creamy vanilla. It became a way to control a small piece of my day, to create a feeling of calm or energy simply by applying a few drops. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something as seemingly frivolous as a perfume can become a surprisingly grounding ritual.  It’s a reminder that even amidst the chaos, there’s room for small, beautiful discoveries – and a little bit of indulgence.  I’m still exploring, still learning, but 2022 taught me that fragrance isn't just about smelling good; it’s about layering your life, one scent at a time.
