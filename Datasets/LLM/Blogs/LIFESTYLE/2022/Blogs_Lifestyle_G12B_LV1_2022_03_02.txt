## Trading Lattes for Leaves: My Caffeine Quest

Okay, so 2022 has been… a lot. And my reliance on coffee to get through it? Even more so. But lately, the jitters and the afternoon crashes have been getting old. I started thinking, there *has* to be a better way to fuel my days.

Enter: black tea. Specifically, *strong* black tea. I'm on a mission to ditch the daily latte habit, and I’m determined to find a loose-leaf variety that packs a serious caffeine punch. It feels surprisingly satisfying, this little ritual of measuring out the leaves, watching them unfurl in the hot water. 

Plus, a splash of milk transforms it into something comforting and familiar. It’s early days, but I’m already feeling a little less wired, a little more… grounded. Wish me luck – and send any high-caffeine loose-leaf recommendations my way!
