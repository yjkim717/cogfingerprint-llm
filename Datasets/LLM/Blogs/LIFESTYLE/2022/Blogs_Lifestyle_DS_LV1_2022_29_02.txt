It’s 2022, and I’m sitting with friends, trying to explain the whiplash of bipolar mood swings. One friend nods—her dad had it. Another admits she stopped her meds last year. Suddenly, I feel so isolated, like I’m speaking a language only they can hear fragments of. Living with this is a lonely road, even in a crowded room. It’s a strange kind of lifestyle, learning to navigate these conversations while holding onto hope.
