The week leading up to the 4th of July in 2022 was a special kind of retail chaos. I was behind the meat counter, surrounded by a beautiful, abundant display of steaksâ€”ribeyes, strips, you name it. Yet, the constant refrain was, "Can you cut me a special one in the back?"

It was a lesson in human nature. We had a holiday's worth of options right there, but the desire for something exclusive, something tailored just for them, overrode the convenience. It made me reflect on my own life, how often I overlook the perfectly good solutions right in front of me, chasing a bespoke fantasy instead of appreciating the plenty already on the shelf.
