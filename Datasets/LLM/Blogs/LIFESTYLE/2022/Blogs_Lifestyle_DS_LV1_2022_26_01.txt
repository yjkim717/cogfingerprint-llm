In the summer of 2022, I realized my laptop wasn’t the only thing overheating—I was too. I’d spend hours tweaking settings, trying to silence the roaring fans, only to feel my own stress levels ramp up. It hit me: my constant need for productivity, that relentless "CPU boosting" of life, was burning me out. So I unplugged. I traded frantic software fixes for quiet walks, letting my mind idle instead of overclock. Sometimes, the best performance upgrade isn’t for your machine, but for your soul.
