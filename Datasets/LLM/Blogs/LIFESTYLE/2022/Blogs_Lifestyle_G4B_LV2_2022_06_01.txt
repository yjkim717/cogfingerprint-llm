**The Unexpected Bill on My JetBlue Flight**

Remember that feeling when a long-haul flight finally ends? I was buzzing with excitement about a trip to see family, but then I saw it – a hefty charge on my credit card from JetBlue. Apparently, a few drinks purchased during the flight had been automatically billed. It felt…wrong. 

Honestly, it’s frustrating when companies don’t clearly communicate their policies. It’s a small thing, sure, but it highlights how easily we can be caught off guard by unexpected costs.  Anyone else have a similar experience lately?
