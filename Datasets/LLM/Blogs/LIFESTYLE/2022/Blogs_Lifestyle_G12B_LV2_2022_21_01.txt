## The Magic Behind the Silver Screen (and My Movie-Loving Dreams)

Remember that feeling of walking into a movie theater? The smell of popcorn, the hushed anticipation… I was lost in thought the other day, wondering how those who *work* at AMC get to experience that magic. Someone on Reddit was asking about it! It got me thinking about all the little wonders we take for granted. Maybe someday I'll be on the other side of the screen, soaking it all in. A girl can dream, right? ✨
