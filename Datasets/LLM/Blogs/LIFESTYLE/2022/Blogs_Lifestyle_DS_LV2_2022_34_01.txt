It’s funny how life’s big questions sneak up on you. For me, it happened in 2022 while staring at my pay stub. My employer’s family health insurance premium had ticked up again, and a nagging thought took root: is this really the best deal?

I started running the numbers, comparing our company plan against a self-sourced policy for my wife and kids. On paper, the employer plan was more expensive. But everyone always talks about the tax advantages, right? You pay with pre-tax dollars, so it must be cheaper.

But then I looked closer. With the standard deduction being what it is, and our particular tax bracket, those supposed savings started to feel… theoretical. Was I just paying a higher premium for the comfort of convenience? Was I outsourcing the headache of shopping around at the cost of our monthly budget?

It’s more than a math problem; it’s a lifestyle choice. That extra money each month could mean less financial strain, more family experiences, or simply peace of mind. It’s a reminder that the “standard” path isn’t always the right one for your family’s unique story.
