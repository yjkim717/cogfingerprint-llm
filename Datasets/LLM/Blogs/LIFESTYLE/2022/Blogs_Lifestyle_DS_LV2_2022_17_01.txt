So, here I am again, 2022 playlist humming in the background, staring at the DVSA app on my phone. The theory test is booked for next week, and the familiar knot of anxiety is back. I can almost feel the glare of that old test centre screen.

Last time, the hazard perception clips tripped me up. I’d click, my heart in my throat, only to be told I was “too early” or “too late.” It felt like a cruel game. This time, I’m trying to be smarter, using the app to drill those specific moving images until my thumb aches.

It’s more than just passing a test; it’s about finally unlocking the next chapter—the freedom of the practical test, of driving on my own. If anyone has any last-minute wisdom for a nervous retaker, my inbox is open! This learner driver is all ears.
