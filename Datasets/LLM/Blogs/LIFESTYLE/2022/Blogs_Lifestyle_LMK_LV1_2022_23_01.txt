"As I navigated my last semester at UF in 2022, I had to get creative with my class schedule. I was taking EEL3872 and ALS3200C, both BF full-time requirements, and juggling two jobs on the side. To make it work, I had to plan meticulously, ensuring I met all my commitments without burning out. It was a challenging balancing act, but it taught me valuable time-management skills and the importance of prioritizing self-care. Looking back, I'm proud of how I managed to stay on top of everything and make the most of my final semester."
