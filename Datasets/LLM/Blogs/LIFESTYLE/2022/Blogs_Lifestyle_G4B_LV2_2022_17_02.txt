**The Hiragana Hurdle & That Familiar Feeling**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 felt like a year of *almosts*. I’d set so many goals, especially when it came to learning Japanese. I’d download apps, buy textbooks, even started practicing my hiragana and katakana… and then, inevitably, the motivation would just… fizzle out. 

It’s a frustrating feeling, isn’t it? Like you’re battling a tiny, persistent anxiety monster whispering, "You’re not good enough. You don’t have time."  I found myself caught in a loop of guilt – guilty for not dedicating hours to it, guilty for feeling overwhelmed. 

I remember one particularly tough week, staring at a page of seemingly endless kana characters, and just wanting to give up.  It’s a surprisingly common experience, I realized, reading about other Japanese learners struggling with the same thing. 

The key, I think, is acknowledging that learning takes *balance*. It’s not about marathon sessions, but tiny, consistent steps.  Maybe just 15 minutes a day? Focusing on enjoying the process, rather than obsessing over perfection? 

Right now, I’m back to my hiragana practice, and this time, I'm trying to be kinder to myself.  Anyone else feel this way?
