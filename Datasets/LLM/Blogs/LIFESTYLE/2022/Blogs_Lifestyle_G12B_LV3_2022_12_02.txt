raunchy, complex, and utterly captivating. It's Willem Dafoe, isn't it? I recently found myself down a Dafoe rabbit hole – *Spider-Man*, *Platoon*, *The Lighthouse*… the list goes on! I was craving more of his intensely committed performances, and the internet happily obliged with a flood of recommendations. It’s amazing how one actor can embody such diverse roles with such conviction. It really makes you appreciate the power of skilled acting to elevate a film, and inspires me to seek out more cinematic gems!
