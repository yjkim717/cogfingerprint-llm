## The Unexpected Joy of Winter Tomatoes (and a Little Light)

Okay, so I’m officially a plant person. Who knew? It started innocently enough, a couple of basil seedlings on the windowsill. But then, last fall, I got ambitious. I saw all these gorgeous photos online of people growing tomatoes and peppers *indoors* over winter, and I thought, "Why not me?"

Turns out, it's a bit more challenging than it looks. My little apartment gets chilly, and those pepper plants were looking decidedly glum by November. That's when I stumbled down the rabbit hole of grow lights. Honestly, I felt a bit silly setting them up, like I was cultivating a tiny, indoor jungle.

But seeing those first tiny green shoots reappear after a week under the light? Pure magic. Now, I’m nursing a few promising tomato seedlings, and my peppers are perking up. It’s a little project, a tiny burst of green in the grey of a 2022 winter, and it's brought a surprising amount of joy. Maybe this whole gardening thing is sticking around.
