Of all the lessons 2022 tried to teach us—about resilience, about connection, about the fragility of our plans—the one that truly rewired my brain was a deceptively simple question I started asking myself each morning: “What is the one main thing?”

It didn’t start as some grand productivity hack. It started with burnout. My to-do list was a sprawling, chaotic monster, a never-ending scroll of tasks that left me feeling busy but perpetually behind. I was a craftsperson, but instead of honing a single skill, I was frantically juggling a dozen different tools, making a lot of noise but creating nothing of substance. I was productive in the way a tornado is—furious, destructive, and ultimately going nowhere.

Then, I stumbled back into the arms of an old friend: the Pareto Principle. You know, the 80/20 rule. I began to look at my endless list not as a mandate, but as a menu. I asked: which 20% of these tasks, if completed, would deliver 80% of the results, the progress, the genuine satisfaction? The answer was almost never “clear out my inbox” or “reorganize the bookshelf.” It was always one thing. The main thing.

For me, that main thing was writing. Not admin for writing, not talking about writing, but the actual, quiet, focused craft of putting words on the page. So, I made a pact with myself. Before I checked a single notification, before I even thought about the day’s minor emergencies, I would protect the first 90 minutes of my workday for that one task. I called it “The Main Thing Block.”

The transformation wasn’t instantaneous, but it was profound. On the first day, the siren call of my phone was almost physical. But I resisted. I wrote. And by 10:30 AM, I had accomplished the day’s most meaningful work. The rest of the day felt different. The pressure valve had been released. Those other tasks? They were still there, but they had lost their power over me. I tackled them with the calm clarity of someone who had already won the day.

This wasn’t just about time management; it was about identity. By consistently choosing the main thing, I stopped being a dabbler and started being a craftsperson again. I was no longer defined by the frantic crossing-off of minor chores, but by the steady, deliberate progress on what truly mattered. In a year that often felt fragmented and reactive, this small act of daily prioritization became my anchor. It was my quiet rebellion against the chaos, a way to ensure that no matter what the world threw at us, I was still building something that felt like mine.

So, if you’re feeling the weight of a list that never ends, I invite you to try it. Don’t try to do it all. Just ask yourself: “What’s the one main thing?” Then, protect it. Do it first. You might just find that in focusing on less, you finally start building more.
