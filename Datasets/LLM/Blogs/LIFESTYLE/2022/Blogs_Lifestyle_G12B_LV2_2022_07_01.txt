## My Echo Show & The Joy of Organized Recipes

Okay, confession time: I’m a *terrible* recipe keeper. Scattered scraps of paper, bookmarks in random browser tabs… it was chaos! Then I got an Echo Show 15. Suddenly, the idea of a digital cookbook felt… attainable. 

I’m wrestling with getting my beloved bookmarks imported into Silk browser now – a Mac vs. PC dilemma! It’s more than just tech; it's about finally bringing order to my culinary life. Anyone else find that little organizational victories feel surprisingly good? 2022 is shaping up to be the year of streamlined cooking!
