It was supposed to be simple: get married, file our taxes jointly. But that one decision pushed our combined income over the Roth IRA limit. Suddenly, our smart savings plan came with a potential tax penalty. I felt so frustrated; we were being penalized for a milestone celebration. Thankfully, we discovered the "backdoor Roth" strategy in 2022. It was a paperwork hassle, but it saved us. A tough first financial lesson as a married teamâ€”always read the fine print, together.
