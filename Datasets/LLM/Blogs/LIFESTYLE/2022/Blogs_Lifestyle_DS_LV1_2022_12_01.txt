It’s 2022, and my crypto portfolio looks like my wilting houseplants—both in need of some TLC. Watching Bitcoin’s dips, I’m reminded of gardening: growth isn’t always visible. Sometimes, roots strengthen underground before the bloom. So, I’m holding steady, trusting the process. After all, patience isn’t just for plants—it’s for portfolios, too.
