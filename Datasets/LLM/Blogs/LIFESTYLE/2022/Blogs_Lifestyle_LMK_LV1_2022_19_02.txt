"I'll be the first to admit, I was head over heels for the Mazda CX-5 when I first started looking for a new ride. Its sleek design and agile handling had me sold. But, as I soon discovered, my enthusiasm was short-lived once I started thinking about the practicalities of family life. With three tiny humans in tow, I quickly realized that the CX-5's charms wouldn't be enough to compensate for its lack of leg room.

As I began to explore alternative roomy SUVs, I was surprised by how many options were available for under $40,000. The quest for a more spacious vehicle led me to consider factors beyond just style and performance. I wanted a car that could accommodate car seats for all three kids, without sacrificing comfort for my passengers (or myself!). 

The Mazda CX-5 may still be on my wishlist, but I've come to realize that there's more to a family-friendly vehicle than just looks. As a parent, I've learned to prioritize practicality, and I'm now on the hunt for an SUV that can keep up with our active lifestyle. It's funny how quickly your priorities can shift â€“ but for us, space is now the top priority."
