It all started with a simple goal: find a reliable SUV under $40,000 that could comfortably fit our growing family, especially those bulky car seats. In 2022, with used car prices soaring, our budget felt tighter than ever. We were initially sold on the sleek Mazda CX-5, picturing our little ones cozied up in the back. But a quick trip to the dealership was a reality check. Juggling a rear-facing infant seat behind the driver was like solving a puzzle with missing piecesâ€”there just wasn't enough room.

That single test drive sent us back to the drawing board, re-evaluating our entire "spacious" criteria. Suddenly, models we'd glanced over, like the trusty Toyota RAV4, the practical Honda CR-V, and even the larger Mazda CX-9, moved to the top of our list. It was a humbling reminder that family life rarely fits into the car you initially fall for. The search became less about style and more about the simple, non-negotiable joy of legroom and easy buckling. Sometimes, the right choice isn't the one you first envisioned, but the one that actually lets you breathe on the journey.
