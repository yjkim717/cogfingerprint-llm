## The Unexpected Upgrade & A Little More Breathing Room

Remember that feeling of being *just* a little bit cramped? Like your life was running on dial-up? That’s been me lately. We finally switched to AT&T Fiber, and with it came a new router – the BGW320-505. It sounds technical, I know! But honestly? The speed difference has been surprisingly impactful. Suddenly, streaming movies, video calls with family, even just browsing feels… smoother. It’s not just about faster internet; it’s about a little more breathing room in the day, a little less frustration. A small upgrade, a big difference.
