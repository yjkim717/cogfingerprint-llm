**Yellow Lights and Worrying Thoughts**

It’s funny how little things can stick with you, right? Last year, I was reading about a DoorDash driver who got into an accident with a flashing yellow light – it really got me thinking about responsibility and how quickly things can go wrong.  Suddenly, the ease of ordering dinner felt a little…complicated. 

I started paying way more attention to my own driving, and honestly, it’s made me appreciate the simple act of getting from A to B. It’s a reminder that even in our hyper-connected world, human error and unexpected situations are always a possibility.  Anyone else find themselves unexpectedly reflective lately?
