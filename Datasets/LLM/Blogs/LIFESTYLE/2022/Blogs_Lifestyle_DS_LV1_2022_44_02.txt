It’s funny how we draw lines in the sand, isn’t it? I was rewatching *The Boys* in 2022, and something about the whole Compound V debate hit differently this time. Here were these characters, all desperate for power or justice, yet so quick to judge anyone who took the "easy" route. It felt familiar.

I started thinking about my own life—the shortcuts I’ve judged, the moral high ground I’ve claimed. Like that time I scoffed at a friend who used a meal delivery service instead of "properly" learning to cook, while I was secretly burning frozen pizzas. Or silently criticizing colleagues for leaning too hard on automation, even as I relied on apps for everything from budgeting to mindfulness.

We’re all just trying to get by, to feel a little more capable in a chaotic world. But we cling to this idea that struggle equals virtue, that if something comes too easily, it must be corrupt. Maybe the real tension isn’t in the choices others make, but in our own unwillingness to admit we’d probably do the same in their shoes. What if we worried less about how others find their strength, and focused more on what we do with our own?
