I recently devoured a list of Willem Dafoe's filmography, and I'm hooked! The man is a chameleon on screen. If you're like me, always on the lookout for great movie recommendations, I've got some gems to share. From the eerie "The Lighthouse" to the quirky "The Grand Budapest Hotel", Dafoe shines in diverse genres. For a dose of his dramatic flair, check out "The Florida Project" or "Antichrist". What's your go-to Willem Dafoe film? I'm always eager to discover new favourites and expand my cinematic horizons in 2022.
