**The Hiragana Hiccup & My Motivation Malaise**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 was *rough* for my Japanese learning journey. I’d signed up for this intense daily routine, fueled by the promise of Genki and a solid grasp of hiragana and katakana. I was diligently practicing, really putting in the hours. But… I was just… *stuck*. 

It felt like I was wading through mud. The characters blurred together, the grammar rules seemed to shift on a whim, and the initial excitement completely evaporated. I’d diligently write out my kana, yet the motivation just wasn’t there. 

I realized I was so focused on *doing* Japanese, I’d forgotten *why* I wanted to learn it in the first place. It wasn’t about ticking boxes or proving something to myself. It was about connecting with a culture I genuinely admired.  Taking a step back, reconnecting with that initial spark – that’s when things started to shift.  It's a constant battle, but remembering the "why" is proving to be my biggest weapon.
