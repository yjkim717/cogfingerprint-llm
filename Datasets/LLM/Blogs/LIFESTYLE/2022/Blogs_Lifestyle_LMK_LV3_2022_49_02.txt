As I watched the news in 2022, I couldn't help but feel that the refugee issue had become a pawn in Turkey's political game. The government's handling of the situation seemed more focused on gaining political mileage than finding a genuine solution. The consequences are now dire, with lives hanging in the balance. It's time for a change. By voting for the right leaders, we can pave the way for a more sensible and compassionate approach, one that prioritizes people over politics and brings much-needed relief to those affected.
