**The Weight of “Should”**

It’s a strange thing, isn’t it? Living a life that feels authentically *you*, while simultaneously carrying the weight of everyone else’s expectations. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about my own family – and a friend who’s bravely facing a similar situation. 

She’s coming out to a deeply conservative Indian family, and the thought of the potential fallout is terrifying. The pressure to marry, to conform… it’s a heavy burden.  It reminds me that sometimes, the hardest conversations aren’t about *what* to say, but about protecting your own heart and honoring your truth, even when it feels like the world is pushing back. 2022 has been a year of realizing that’s a battle worth fighting.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps create a different version with a slightly altered focus?
