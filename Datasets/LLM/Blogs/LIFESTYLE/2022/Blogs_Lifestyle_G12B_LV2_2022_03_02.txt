## Trading My Mug: The Quest for a Caffeine Kick That Isn't Coffee

Okay, real talk: I’m trying to break up with coffee. Seriously. Years of the daily ritual, the frantic morning rush for a latte… it felt a little *too* much. This year (2022), I’m on a mission to find a replacement that delivers that same caffeine jolt, but with a different vibe. 

Enter: black tea. Specifically, *strong* black tea, loose leaf if I’m being picky. It’s been a surprisingly delightful journey of experimentation. There’s something comforting about the ritual of brewing loose leaves, and the robust flavor is actually hitting the spot. Wish me luck – and send your favorite black tea recommendations!
