It’s Talent Tuesday again, and I’m still amazed at what we create in sobriety. Last week, I watched a friend—a fellow sobernaut—scale a rock climbing wall with a focus she never had while drinking. Me? I’ve been sketching, something I abandoned years ago.

In 2022, life feels different. Before, my "talent" was just getting through the night. Now, we’re building, climbing, painting—not to escape, but to connect. This community reminds me that recovery isn’t about losing a crutch; it’s about rediscovering the hands that can create, hold on, and lift others up. What will you make today?
