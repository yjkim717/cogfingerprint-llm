"Rebooting my routine was a lot like restarting my openSUSE Leap system - sometimes it froze on me. Literally. When I'd boot up my laptop and fire up Firefox first thing, the whole system would lock up. Frustrating, to say the least. But, just as I tweaked my startup apps to avoid the freeze, I've been tweaking my morning routine to avoid a mental slump. Now, I ease into my day with a cup of coffee and some gentle stretches before diving into work. It's been a game-changer. My productivity - and sanity - have never been better. A simple reboot can work wonders, it seems!"
