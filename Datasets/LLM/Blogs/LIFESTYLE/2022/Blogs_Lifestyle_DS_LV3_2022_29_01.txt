### The One Thing I Refused to Skimp On for Our Wedding

Let’s be real—planning a wedding in 2022 felt like trying to build a sandcastle as the tide was coming in. Everything was more expensive, and every decision felt monumental. My partner and I knew from the start that our budget wasn’t endless. We wanted an intimate celebration, something that felt like *us*, not a page from a bridal magazine.

So, we got creative. My dream of a custom-made dress? I found a stunning, simple one off-the-rack that felt just as special. The grand, expensive venue? We fell in love with the idea of a friend’s sprawling, sun-dappled backyard. It felt cozy and authentic. By making these conscious choices, we freed up a significant part of our budget.

And we knew exactly where that money was going: the photographer.

For us, the day itself would be a beautiful, fleeting blur. The laughter, the quiet glances, the way the light filtered through the oak trees in our backyard venue—these were the moments we wanted to hold onto forever. We weren’t just paying for pictures; we were investing in our memory. The search for the right photographer was intense. I spent hours scrolling through portfolios, not just looking for technical skill, but for someone who captured emotion, the little in-between moments that tell the real story.

It was the best decision we made. Because now, when I look at those photos, I don’t just see our wedding day. I feel the warmth of the sun and the overwhelming joy all over again. Sometimes, the smartest splurge isn't on the thing everyone sees on the day, but on the artifact that lets you relive it for a lifetime.
