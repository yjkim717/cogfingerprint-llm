**The Mile Crunch: Can an Ultrarunner Survive Corporate Travel?**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt… intense. Between my ultrarunning schedule and a job that demanded I be on planes practically every other week, my body was screaming. I was chasing those 50-mile goals, but simultaneously battling a serious case of “existential runner’s burnout.” 

I’d hit a wall. The usual marathon training felt impossible when I was crammed into a tiny hotel room in Denver, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the desperate need to finish a conference call. Was I supposed to just *pause* my training? It felt like admitting defeat, but continuing to push felt like a slow, agonizing injury waiting to happen.

Ultimately, I decided on a modified approach. Short, sharp runs – 30-45 minutes – squeezed in before meetings or after long days. I focused on maintaining a base level of fitness, not chasing PRs. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was sustainable. 

The biggest lesson? Listening to my body is *always* the priority. Sometimes, ‘fitness’ looks like prioritizing sleep and a decent meal over another grueling mile. It’s about finding the balance, and accepting that life, and travel, will inevitably disrupt your meticulously planned routines.  What’s worked for me might not work for you, but hopefully, this helps you navigate the mile crunch too!
