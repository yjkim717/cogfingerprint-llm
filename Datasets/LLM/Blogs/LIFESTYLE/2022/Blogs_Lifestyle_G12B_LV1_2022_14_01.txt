## The Tightrope Walk of Financial Freedom (and Delayed Perks!)

Okay, so 2022 has been… a *year* for finances, hasn’t it? I finally took the plunge and got an American Express card a few months back, lured in by the promise of travel reimbursements and rewards. Seemed like a smart move! Except… the reimbursements are seriously lagging, and honestly, I'm feeling the pressure of paying it down alongside my other debt.

It’s got me questioning everything. Is closing the card the right call, even if it feels like abandoning a potential lifeline? It’s a weird tightrope walk – wanting to be financially responsible *and* enjoying the perks that supposedly make life a little easier. Anyone else wrestling with similar choices right now? Send good vibes (and maybe some wisdom!) my way.
