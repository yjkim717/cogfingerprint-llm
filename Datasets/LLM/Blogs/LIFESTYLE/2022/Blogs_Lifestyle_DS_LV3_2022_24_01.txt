The other day, I found myself staring at my old windsurfing board, collecting dust in the garage. It’s a beast to transport—a true test of patience and roof-rack engineering. But oh, the thrill of catching the wind, the spray on my face… it’s a feeling that’s hard to top.

Then there’s wingfoiling. In 2022, it feels like everyone’s talking about it. The gear is lighter, easier to manage, and there’s no denying the novelty—it looks like something from the future. But is it just a passing gimmick, or the next chapter in watersports?

For me, it’s not just about what’s easier to haul to the beach. It’s about that pure connection with the elements, whether I’m sailing on a board I’ve trusted for years or floating above the water on a foil. The real journey is finding what makes you feel most alive.
