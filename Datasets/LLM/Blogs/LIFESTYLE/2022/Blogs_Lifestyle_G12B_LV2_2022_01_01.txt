## Three Months & a Shelf Full of Scents

It’s wild to think it’s already late 2022! Lately, I've been diving deep into fragrance – building a little collection. Seeing a Reddit thread sparked something; it’s surprisingly therapeutic to curate scents. My Millesime Imperial is a constant reach, while the Moustache EDP is a delightful surprise. Even with exciting discoveries, not everything clicks (looking at you, CDNIM!). It’s a learning process, and I’m enjoying the journey.
