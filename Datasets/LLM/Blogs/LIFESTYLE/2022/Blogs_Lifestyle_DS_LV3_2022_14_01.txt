It was early 2022, and I thought I was making a savvy financial move by opening that premium Amex card. The promise of future reimbursements was alluring. But the reality? My financial situation quickly became a source of daily stress. The reimbursement delays were agonizing, clashing directly with my goal to pay down existing credit card debt. I learned the hard way that a flashy card is a burden, not a benefit, when it doesn't align with your actual needs. It was a pricey lesson in financial self-awareness.
