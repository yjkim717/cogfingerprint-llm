**Dockside Musings & Muddy Catfish**

Late 2022 found me escaping to Ohio for a few weeks, and I spent a surprising amount of time perched on the docks of the Ohio River. It wasn’t for sightseeing, though – I was trying to land some catfish! Honestly, the river was a mess of debris, and those cats were *persistent*. I experimented with different rigs and baits, mostly just trying to outsmart them. It’s funny how a simple fishing trip can make you think about patience and adapting to the unexpected – just like life, really.  Sometimes you just need to find your ‘rig’ and keep at it.
