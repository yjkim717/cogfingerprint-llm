**The Quiet Pull of the River**

There’s something about the Ohio River that just pulls at you, doesn’t it? I spent a good chunk of 2022 trying to tap into that feeling, specifically near Louisville. I wasn't after catfish – honestly, I was over them! – but just wanted to feel the rhythm of the water, the quiet concentration of a good dock fishing session. 

I was experimenting with different rig baits, trying to find that sweet spot. It reminded me of settling into a routine, a little bit of focused effort against a constant flow. Maybe that’s what we all crave sometimes – a steady pull, a quiet challenge, and the satisfaction of simply being present beside the water.
