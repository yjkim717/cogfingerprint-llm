The glow of my phone screen casts a pale blue light across the anonymous hotel room. 4:45 AM. In a few hours, I’ll be in a conference room, my mind navigating spreadsheets and project timelines. But for now, my world is the hum of the treadmill in the hotel gym and the steady rhythm of my breath. This is the reality of chasing ultrarunning dreams while tethered to a career that demands long hours and constant work travel.

I used to think training was about the big, epic Saturday long runs on familiar trails. And those are vital, the soul-food of the sport. But I’ve learned that fitness is built, or lost, in the in-between moments. It’s the 45 minutes squeezed in before a cross-country flight, the bodyweight circuit in my room after a 12-hour day, the conscious choice to walk through a new city instead of taking a cab. Maintenance isn’t a glamorous word, but in 2022, it’s become my mantra. It’s the quiet discipline of showing up for my body even when my mind is screaming for the hotel bed.

This balancing act has forced a profound shift in my perspective. The goal is no longer to crush every single workout, but to string together consistency without tipping into burnout or injury. Some days, the "run" is just a mindful 20-minute jog, a way to shake out the travel stiffness and reset my mental compass. I’ve traded rigid, mileage-obsessed plans for flexible, intuitive training. Did I only get five hours of sleep because of a late client dinner? Then today’s session becomes active recovery, not a hill repeat massacre.

It’s a strange harmony. The very thing that complicates my training—the travel, the long hours—has also taught me its most valuable lesson: resilience. Pounding out miles on a treadmill in Denver or finding a sliver of park in Chicago grounds me. It’s my moving meditation, my constant in a life of flux. The finish line of a 50-miler is still the dream, but now I see that the real victory is in these quiet, solitary mornings, proving to myself that my passion can adapt, persist, and thrive, no matter the zip code.
