**The Slow Drip of Change**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How some things feel like a slow diffusion, like trying to pull a stubborn solvent through a packed bed. Last year, 2022, I felt stuck. Just… sitting there, surrounded by all these particles – commitments, anxieties, old habits – and not really *moving*. 

I realized I was focusing on the *size* of each problem, getting overwhelmed by the sheer volume.  Like meticulously measuring particle size in an extraction process.  It wasn’t about tackling everything at once, but about consistently letting a little bit of change flow through. 

Small shifts – a daily walk, a mindful conversation, saying ‘no’ – they weren’t dramatic, but they were persistent.  It's a reminder that sometimes the most effective extraction happens with a gentle, steady drip.  What’s your slow diffusion looking like lately?

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or adjusting the length?
