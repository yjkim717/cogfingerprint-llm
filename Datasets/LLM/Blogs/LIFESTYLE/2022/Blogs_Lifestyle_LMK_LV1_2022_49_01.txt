"Stuck in a Sea of Screens: Keeping the Spark Alive in Long Distance Love"

As I sit here in my small apartment, thousands of miles away from my partner, I'm reminded of the challenges of maintaining a long distance relationship in 2022. The pandemic may have brought the world to a standstill, but for many of us, it meant being apart from our loved ones for longer than ever before. With overseas work commitments and travel restrictions, phone calls have become our lifeline. But let's be real - staring at a screen for hours, talking about the same old things, can get stale. So, how do we make these virtual dates more exciting? For us, it's about being intentional with our time together. We schedule virtual movie nights, play online games, and even cook together over video call. It's not the same as being there in person, but it's a start.
