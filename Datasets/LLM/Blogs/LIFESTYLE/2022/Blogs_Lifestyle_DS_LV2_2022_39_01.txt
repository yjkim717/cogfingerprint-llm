As I scroll through my fall 2022 class schedule, the "Equitable Access" opt-out deadline looms. PLS 21 and ECN 1A stare back, their textbook costs giving me pause. Is this digital bundle truly equitable, or just another fee? I think of the coffee shops I’ll skip, the budget I’ll stretch. It’s more than a textbook decision—it’s about the lifestyle trade-offs we make as students, balancing our education with the reality of making ends meet. A modern student’s dilemma, indeed.
