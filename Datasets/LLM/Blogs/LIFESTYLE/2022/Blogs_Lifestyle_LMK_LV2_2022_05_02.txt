As I sat gaming on my PC in 2022, I was frustrated by the lag in Elden Ring while using my PS5 controller. I suspected the motion sensor was the culprit. This hiccup made me realize how much our gaming experiences can be marred by minor tech issues. It's a reminder to appreciate the balance in our lives - between the virtual worlds we escape to and the real world that needs our attention. Sometimes, it's the little glitches that bring us back to reality.
