The joys of parenthood! As I sat in my living room in 2022, trying to coax my 7-month-old baby to take their antibiotics, I couldn't help but feel frustrated. The doctor had prescribed a course of medication to clear up their nasty chest infection, but administering it was proving to be a challenge.

The liquid medicine was a vile concoction that seemed designed to be as unpalatable as possible. My poor baby would screw up their face in distaste as soon as the spoon touched their lips, and I was left wrestling with them to get the stuff down. It was a daily struggle, and one that left us both in tears.

As I looked into my baby's pleading eyes, I couldn't help but wonder why it had to be this way. Why did medicine have to taste so bad? And why was it so hard to get my little one to take something that was supposed to make them better?

As I navigated this tricky phase of infant care, I realized that administering medicine was just one of the many challenges that came with being a parent. But with patience, persistence, and a few tricks up my sleeve (like mixing the medicine with a bit of breastmilk or fruit puree), we slowly got the hang of it. And as my baby's health began to improve, I knew that it was all worth it. If you're a fellow parent struggling to give your little one their medication, take heart - you're not alone, and with a bit of trial and error, you'll get through it too.
