### The Paper Wall: My Hunt for a Home in 2022

I remember scrolling through apartment listings in 2022, my optimism slowly deflating. It wasn't the sky-high prices that got me this time—I was prepared for that New York reality. It was a different, more insidious barrier: the ubiquitous "700+ credit score required."

My score is decent. I pay my bills. But that three-digit number started to feel less like a financial snapshot and more like a judgment on my entire character. I’d picture a faceless landlord looking at my application, not seeing a person with a steady job and a love for hosting dinner parties, but seeing a number that was, apparently, just shy of "good enough."

It created this strange paradox. To have a good score, you need credit. To build credit, you often need to take on debt. It felt like a game I hadn’t realized I was playing until I was already losing. The hunt for a simple apartment became a lesson in a system that often feels rigged, where past financial stumbles—a medical bill, a student loan—can haunt you for years, locking you out of a place to call home.

It’s more than just a number; it’s a paper wall, and it’s one too many of us are struggling to climb.
