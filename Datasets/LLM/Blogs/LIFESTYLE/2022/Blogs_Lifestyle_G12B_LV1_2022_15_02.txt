## That Screenshot Still Haunts Me (And Why You Should Think Twice)

It's funny, isn’t it, how a moment can feel so fleeting, so insignificant, and then have this lingering shadow years later? I was thinking about that the other day, remembering something that happened back in high school.

It was 2016, Peak Snapchat era. Everyone was obsessed with streaks, filters, and those disappearing messages. A friend, let's call her Sarah, sent me a picture – a silly, playful selfie, nothing overtly suggestive. But at the time, fuelled by the social pressure and the anonymity of the platform, I screenshotted it. I don’t even remember *why*. Maybe it was to show another friend, maybe just a fleeting impulse.

Looking back, it feels…wrong. And the guilt, honestly, hasn't fully gone away. It was a small thing in the grand scheme, but Sarah never knew. And the thought of that image, potentially out there somewhere, existing without her consent… it’s unsettling.

Fast forward to 2022, and the conversations around online privacy and digital safety feel louder, more urgent. We're all more aware of how easily things can be shared and misused. Thinking about that old screenshot reminded me of how naive we were, how casually we treated digital images.

It’s a reminder to be mindful. To consider the potential consequences, not just for yourself, but for others. A quick snap, a fleeting thought to share…it can have a ripple effect you never anticipate.  Think before you screenshot. Think before you share.  Your digital footprint is permanent, and someone else’s wellbeing might depend on it.
