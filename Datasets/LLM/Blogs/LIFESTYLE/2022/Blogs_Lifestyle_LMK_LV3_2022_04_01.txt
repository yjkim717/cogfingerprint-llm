As I sat with my travel plans on hold, I found myself torn between two exciting options: an international escapade or a domestic adventure. With the world slowly reopening in 2022, the thrill of exploring new destinations was hard to resist. But, as I weighed my choices, the uncertainty surrounding international travel - from navigating car rentals to dealing with potential logistical hiccups - gave me pause. Perhaps, I thought, a domestic trip would be the way to go. The Midwest, with its rolling hills and scenic hiking trails, beckoned. I envisioned spending my days immersed in nature, hiking through lush forests and breathing in the fresh air. In the end, I realized that sometimes the best adventures are the ones closest to home. By opting for a domestic trip, I could still satisfy my wanderlust while avoiding the stress that came with international travel.
