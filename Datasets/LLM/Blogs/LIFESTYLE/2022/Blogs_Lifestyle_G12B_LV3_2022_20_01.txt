## Orange Roots and a Little Panic (But Maybe Hope?)

Okay, friends, I need to confess something. I attempted a DIY root touch-up with Ardell Gray Magic last weekend â€“ you know, the quick fix for those pesky greys. Let's just say I got a *little* enthusiastic with the application. Now, my roots are sporting a distinctly orange hue. ðŸ˜¬ 

Anyone else ever have a DIY hair disaster? Iâ€™m hoping this is just a temporary blip and that the orange tones fade fast. Send good vibes (and any tips!) my way! #hairdye #rootouchup #diyhair #2022
