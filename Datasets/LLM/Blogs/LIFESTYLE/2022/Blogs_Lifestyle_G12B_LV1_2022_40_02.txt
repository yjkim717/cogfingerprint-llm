## The Weight of the Highlight Reel & Finding My Way Back to "Just Being"

It's weird, isn't it? How much of our expectations around… well, *everything*… are shaped by things we see online? Especially in the last few years, scrolling through Instagram, TikTok, even just the endless stream of content, it feels like everyone’s living a perfectly curated, highlight-reel life. And that pressure, subtle but constant, seeps into all sorts of areas, doesn't it?

For me, for a good while, it manifested in a strange kind of anxiety around intimacy. I won’t go into specifics, but let’s just say I’d built up this… *ideal* in my head. A performance to live up to. It was fueled by a bunch of things - media portrayals, conversations overheard, and yeah, let's be honest, the occasional foray into things I knew weren't entirely healthy for my headspace.

The problem wasn't necessarily a lack of connection with someone. It was the *noise*. This constant internal commentary, a running critique of whether I was measuring up to this fabricated standard. Was I being engaging enough? Was I saying the right things? Was I… *performing* well? It sucked the joy out of it. It made moments that should have been natural and playful feel like auditions.

Then, last year, something shifted. It wasn't a sudden epiphany, more of a gradual realization that this whole performance was exhausting, and ultimately, completely detached from reality. I started questioning where these expectations were even coming from. And the more I thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed to base genuine human connection on something so artificial.

I began actively pulling back. Less scrolling, more being present. Less focusing on "doing it right," and more focusing on… *feeling*. It’s been a process, a bit like relearning something I’d forgotten. There’s more laughter, more genuine curiosity, and a whole lot less self-consciousness. It's about reclaiming the simple pleasure of just *being* with someone, without the pressure of a script.

It’s a reminder that real intimacy isn’t about hitting some arbitrary benchmark. It’s about vulnerability, honesty, and allowing yourself to be imperfect. And honestly? That's a lot more exciting than any highlight reel could ever be.  It’s a work in progress, but I’m feeling a lot lighter, and a lot more connected to myself and to the people I care about.  Maybe you're feeling some of this pressure too. Just remember, you don't have to audition for anyone.
