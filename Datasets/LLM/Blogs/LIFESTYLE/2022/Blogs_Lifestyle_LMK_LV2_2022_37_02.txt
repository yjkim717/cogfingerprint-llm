As I sat by the fireplace, knitting my latest elvish-inspired cardigan, I couldn't help but think of my trusty DnD character. The intricate patterns and wizardy details transported me to a world of fantasy. In 2022, I've found solace in crafting, where imagination meets cozy comforts, and my love for storytelling comes alive.
