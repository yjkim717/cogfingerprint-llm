It was supposed to be a simple, modern upgrade. My old phone was gasping its last breaths, and the new Pixel 7, paired with that sleek Pixel Watch, felt like the perfect 2022 duo. A little treat for myself.

The Google Store checkout was a breeze. I added both to my cart, applied the tempting trade-in credit, and watched the total plummet. Perfect! I felt like a savvy shopper, outsmarting the system.

A week later, the euphoria evaporated with a single bank statement check. The final charge was significantly higher. My heart sank. After a confusing deep-dive into the fine print, I discovered the truth: the credit only applied to the phone, not the watch. The cart display had been, at best, misleading.

It was a small thing in the grand scheme, but it left a sour taste. A reminder that in our digital lives, the promise of a seamless upgrade can sometimes come with hidden asterisks, making you feel less like a valued customer and more like just another data point.
