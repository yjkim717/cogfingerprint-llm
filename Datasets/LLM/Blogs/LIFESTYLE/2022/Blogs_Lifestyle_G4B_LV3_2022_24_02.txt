**The Vegan Flash Mob**

Remember those quick vegan episodes on the Food Network back in 2022? A celebrity chef throws together a beautiful plant-based dish, then – poof! – it’s back to steak and potatoes. It always felt a little… disingenuous, didn’t it? Like a marketing stunt rather than genuine exploration. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about it lately, especially with the incredible creativity happening in the meat substitute world. Brilliant vegan chefs and innovators are building *delicious* alternatives, pushing boundaries. It’s frustrating to see these shifts dismissed.  Maybe we need to demand more than just fleeting interest – a real celebration of plant-based innovation, not just a seasonal trend.
