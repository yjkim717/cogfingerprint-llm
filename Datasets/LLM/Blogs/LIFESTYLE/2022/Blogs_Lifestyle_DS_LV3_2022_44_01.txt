There’s something meditative about brewing a cup of coffee in the morning—the slow drip of water through packed grounds, the rich aroma that fills the kitchen. It’s a small ritual, but it grounds me. In 2022, as life sped up again post-lockdowns, I found myself clinging to these quiet moments, trying to extract every bit of meaning from them.

It got me thinking about how we “extract” value from our daily routines. Much like modeling the diffusion of flavor from coffee grounds in a packed bed, our lives are a series of small transfers—of energy, focus, and intention. Do we focus on the surface-level details, the individual “particles” of our day, or step back to see the whole system at work? I used to obsess over optimizing every minute, but I’ve learned it’s the flow—the gentle, heated circulation of habits and rest—that truly enriches us.

Life, like a well-designed extraction process, isn’t just about efficiency. It’s about allowing time for depth, for the essence to diffuse fully. Whether it’s savoring that first sip of coffee or carving out space for a walk, these are the moments where clarity emerges. In a world that often values speed, maybe the real art lies in designing our days to let meaning seep through, slowly and surely.
