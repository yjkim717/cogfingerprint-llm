"As I sat with my laptop open, staring at a map of Europe, I couldn't help but feel torn. A week-long trip to Italy was calling my name - the thought of indulging in pasta, gelato, and la dolce vita was tantalizing. But, as I began to price out flights and accommodations, my wallet started to scream. That's when I turned my gaze to the Midwest, where the rolling hills and scenic trails of my own backyard beckoned. I started to imagine hiking along the Lake Michigan shoreline or biking through the Iowa countryside. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that sometimes the best adventures are the ones closest to home. As I weighed my options, I began to lean towards a domestic trip - after all, there's beauty in exploring the great outdoors without breaking the bank. The thought of a Midwestern adventure was starting to feel like the perfect antidote to a busy 2022."
