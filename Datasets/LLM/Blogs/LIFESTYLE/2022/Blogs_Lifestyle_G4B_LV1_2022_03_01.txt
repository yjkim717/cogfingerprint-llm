**Trading Concrete for Cobblestones: My Slightly Terrified, Very Hopeful Vanlife Plan**

Okay, deep breath. I’m staring down a pretty massive change, and honestly, it feels a little like jumping off a cliff… with a meticulously crafted spreadsheet. For the past few months, I’ve been wrestling with this urge – this *need* – to just…shift. To trade my predictable 9-to-5 for the open road, a tiny house on wheels, and the promise of remote work. Vanlife, basically.

It's not a sudden epiphany, you know? It’s been simmering for a while, fueled by a desire for a bigger ‘why’ than just a paycheck.  And, let’s be real, a growing need to escape the constant hum of city life. But underneath that romantic ideal, there’s a hefty dose of anxiety. 

I’m a recovering addict, and the thought of relying on my own willpower for weeks, months, *years* on end is… daunting. So, this van isn’t just about freedom; it's about building a structure for my recovery, a deliberate step towards a healthier, more grounded life. 

My budget is tight – bracingly so – and I’ve been spending hours researching remote work opportunities. The goal is to earn enough to cover gas, campsites, and, crucially, the occasional fancy coffee.  Then there’s the whole “transition” thing.  How do you sell everything? How do you tell people you're leaving?  And, let's be honest, how do you even *shower* safely on the side of a highway? 

It’s a terrifying and exhilarating mix.  I’m acutely aware of the accessibility challenges – not everyone can just pack up and go. But I'm determined to make this work, not for Instagram, but for *me*.  I want to build a life that prioritizes my well-being, my creativity, and my connection to the world. Wish me luck - and send good vibes (and maybe some tips on discreet shower solutions!).
