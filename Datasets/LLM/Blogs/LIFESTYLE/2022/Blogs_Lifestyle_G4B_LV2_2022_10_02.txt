**The Loop I Almost Got Lost In**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we can fall into patterns, especially when those patterns are fueled by something… messy. 2022 was a year of a lot of upheaval, a lot of trying to find my footing after a particularly tough period. And nestled right in the middle of it all was this insistent, dark little loop, centered entirely around alcohol.

I wasn’t a wild partier, not really. But there was this quiet comfort I’d built around it – a way to numb the edges of anxiety, to silence the critical voice in my head. It started with a glass, then two, and before I knew it, I was chasing a feeling of peace that always dissolved into a wave of shame. 

It wasn’t a dramatic, Hollywood-style spiral. It was insidious. Just a constant, low-level hum of “one more,” followed by the inevitable regret and the feeling of being utterly, hopelessly behind. I’d tell myself I was in control, that I could stop whenever I wanted. But the craving would always find a way back in, whispering promises of temporary relief.

Honestly, there were days I felt trapped, convinced this was just… *me*. That this was my default setting.  

Then, something shifted. A friend, bless their heart, gently pointed out that I wasn’t alone, and that help was available. And it wasn’t a sudden, miraculous cure. It was a slow, messy, incredibly vulnerable process of reaching out, accepting support, and learning to recognize the triggers. 

I’m incredibly grateful for that support.  Sobriety isn’t a destination, it’s a daily choice, a conscious act of defiance against that old, familiar loop.  It’s a reminder that even when things feel darkest, there's always a path forward, and that sometimes, the greatest strength lies in admitting you need a hand.
