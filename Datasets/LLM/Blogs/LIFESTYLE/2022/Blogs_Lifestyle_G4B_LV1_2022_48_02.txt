**Three Years & Still Searching: Was It Worth It?**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 was *the* year of the house hunt. For me, it felt like an epic, slightly chaotic three-year saga. I stubbornly decided to go it alone, skipping the buyer’s agent route and diving headfirst into open houses. 

There were moments of pure excitement, discovering hidden gems, and a surprising amount of negotiation savvy. But there were also weeks of feeling utterly overwhelmed, wading through endless listings, and battling bidding wars. 

Looking back, I’m starting to wonder if the time investment – both mine and, let’s face it, the agent’s – was truly worth it. Was I sacrificing valuable time I could have spent actually *living*? It’s a question I’m still grappling with, and one I suspect many first-time buyers in 2022 are asking themselves too.
