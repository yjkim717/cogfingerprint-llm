As I sat in front of my phone, deeply engrossed in Epic Seven, I couldn't help but think about my gaming strategy - or lack thereof. I'd been experimenting with different expedition teams, trying to crack the code to higher scores. But as I scrolled through online forums, I realized I'm not alone in this struggle. Many players were sharing their teams and seeking advice, and it struck me - we're all in this together. In a world where mobile gaming can be a solitary activity, it's refreshing to connect with others who share our passions. As I continued to play, I felt a sense of community wash over me. It's moments like these that remind me to appreciate the little things - like a well-crafted RGB dark light theme, or the thrill of defeating a tough boss. In 2022, it's amazing how gaming can bring people together, and I'm grateful to be a part of it.
