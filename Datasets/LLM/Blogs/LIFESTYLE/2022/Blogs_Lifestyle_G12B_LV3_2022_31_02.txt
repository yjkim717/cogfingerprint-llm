## The Sweetest Kind of Heartbreak

It’s funny, isn’t it? How fostering something – a pet, a plant, even a dream – can fill your life with so much joy, and then leave this quiet ache when it’s time to let go. I recently waved goodbye to a little bunny I’d been fostering, and the mix of emotions was… a lot. 

Seeing him hop into his forever home, knowing he'd be showered with love and endless head scratches, was pure happiness. But there was also this bittersweet pang. He’d become a little shadow, a fuzzy friend who brightened my days. 

Fostering isn't always easy; it’s a beautiful cycle of giving and releasing. It's a reminder that sometimes, the greatest love means wanting the best for someone else, even if it means saying goodbye. 2022 has been a year of letting go in so many ways, and this felt like a gentle lesson in that.
