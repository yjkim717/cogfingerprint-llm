**The Power of Just *One* Tiny Step**

Okay, let’s be honest. 2022 felt… a lot. Like a lot of everything. Between the lingering anxieties of the past couple of years and the constant hum of social media, it's easy to get completely overwhelmed. I found myself staring at a mountain of “shoulds” – should be healthier, should be more productive, should be *better* – and feeling utterly paralyzed.

I realized I was letting the *idea* of progress completely overshadow the actual *doing*. I'd spend hours researching the perfect workout plan, meticulously outlining a year-long writing project, and still… nothing.  I was stuck in a cycle of aspiration and avoidance.

Then, a little voice (probably my overly-organized brain) gently suggested a shift. It wasn’t about grand gestures, it was about daily action. Really, truly *small* steps. 

I started with five minutes of stretching in the morning. Five minutes. That's it. Then, I committed to writing just *one* paragraph a day. One. It felt ridiculously small, almost silly, but something shifted. 

The thing about consistently taking those tiny steps is that they build. Exponentially, actually.  That five-minute stretch led to ten, then twenty. The single paragraph blossomed into a page, then a chapter. 

It’s not about becoming an overnight success; it’s about cultivating a habit of showing up, even when you don't *feel* like it.  It’s about recognizing that long-term goals aren’t achieved with massive leaps, but with the quiet, persistent power of daily effort. 

This year, I’m reminding myself that the most important thing isn’t the destination, it’s the journey – and that journey starts with just one tiny step. 

What’s one small step *you* can take today?
