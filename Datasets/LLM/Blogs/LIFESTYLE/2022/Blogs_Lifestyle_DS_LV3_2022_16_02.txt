It’s funny how a single unexpected twist in a game like Hearts of Iron 4 can mirror life in 2022. I’d planned a careful Soviet Union run, but the AI threw my historical focuses out the window, leaving me facing the entire world.

It reminded me that no matter how much we mod our routines or script our days, life loves a wild scenario. Sometimes, the best growth comes from embracing the chaos, not resisting it—both on the map and off.
