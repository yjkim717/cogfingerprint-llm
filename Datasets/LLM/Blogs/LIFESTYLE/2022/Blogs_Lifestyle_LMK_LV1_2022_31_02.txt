"As I watched my foster rabbit hop away to their forever home in 2022, I felt a mix of emotions. I was thrilled they'd found a loving family to care for them, but a pang of sadness hit me too. Caring for this little bunny had created a strong emotional attachment. It reminded me that pet adoption is a bittersweet journey. While it's wonderful to give a deserving animal a second chance, it's hard to let go. As I reflected on our time together, I realized that the joy of fostering far outweighed the sorrow, and I was grateful for the experience."
