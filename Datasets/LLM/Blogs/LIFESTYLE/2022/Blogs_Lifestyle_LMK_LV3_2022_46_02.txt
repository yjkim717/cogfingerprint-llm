As I watched my 3D printer hum along, I wondered: what if it could alert me when a print job hit a snag? Using Klipper and my trusty BTT Octopus, I discovered the pause command. But, I wanted more - a way to signal me for user intervention. This got me thinking: how often do we overlook the little things that could make a big difference in our daily routines? Just like fine-tuning my 3D printing setup, refining our daily habits can lead to a more streamlined, stress-free life. It's all about finding those moments to pause and adjust.
