There’s a scene in *Mad Men* where a character pulls out a Polaroid camera, and something about the soft click and whir of that vintage gadget tugged at me. It wasn’t just the show’s aesthetic—it was a memory. My grandfather had one just like it, a boxy, beautiful antique camera that felt like magic in your hands.

In 2022, we’re drowning in instant digital images, but that tangible, imperfect square of film holds a different kind of power. I dug his old Polaroid out of a dusty closet, the weight of it familiar and strange. Finding film was its own quest—a niche, almost secretive hunt that made me wonder why I was going through the trouble for a technology long declared obsolete.

But then I held the first developed photo: my daughter, mid-laugh, a little blurry and washed with that dreamy nostalgia only Polaroid seems to capture. It wasn’t just a picture; it was an artifact. In that moment, I felt a connection—not just to my grandfather, who’d once aimed this same device at his own family, but to the deliberate slowness of it all. You get one shot. No deleting, no filters. Just a fragile, physical piece of time.

Maybe preserving these old ways isn’t about resisting progress, but about holding onto the tangible threads that tie our stories together. In a world of endless scrolling, sometimes the past offers the pause we didn’t know we needed.
