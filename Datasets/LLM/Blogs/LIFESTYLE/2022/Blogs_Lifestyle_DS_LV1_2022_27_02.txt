It’s 2022, and I’m sitting across from my parents, my heart pounding. They’re showing me another photo of a potential match, talking about marriage like it’s a settled fact. I love them, but I’m living a double life. How do I tell my conservative Indian family that their daughter is gay? The pressure to conform is immense, but so is the weight of this secret. I just want them to love the real me. It’s the scariest conversation I’ll ever have.
