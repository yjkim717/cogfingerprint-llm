Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the summary and keywords, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational tone, set in 2022, and around 150 words:

## Drowning in Data, Yearning for Clarity

It's 2022, and I feel like we're *all* drowning in data. Not just professionally, but personally too. Spreadsheets overflowing with budget tracking, CSV files brimming with fitness stats… it's a lot. I recently realized I was spending more time *organizing* my information than actually *using* it.

That sparked a little quest: could I find a way to make sense of these mountains of data without needing a computer science degree? I stumbled upon the world of open-source tools that let you filter and visualize even massive datasets – think 20-100GB! – with a simple web interface. 

It's more than just about the data itself; it's about reclaiming my time and mental space. Finding that clarity, that ability to quickly slice and dice information, has been surprisingly liberating. Anyone else feeling this data overload and looking for a little digital sanity?

**Notes on the approach:**

*   **Relatable Opening:** Started with a common feeling (data overload) to draw the reader in.
*   **Personal Story:** Frame the search for a solution as a personal journey.
*   **Connection to Keywords:**  Subtly incorporated the keywords ("CSV," "data filtering," "open source") within the narrative.
*   **Reflective Tone:** Ended with a question to encourage reader engagement and a sense of shared experience.
*   **Year Context:** The intro specifically mentions "It's 2022" to ground the piece in the relevant timeframe.
