**Lost in the Woods (and Maybe a Little Lost Myself)**

It’s funny how a little plea on Reddit can suddenly pull at your heartstrings. I saw a post about a lost corgi mix near Shands on the UFL campus – a black and white whirlwind someone was desperately hoping to reunite with its owner. It made me think about how easily we get caught up in our own routines, missing the small moments and the potential for connection.  Like that quick glance, that shared smile.  Maybe it’s time to be a little more like that Reddit user, scanning the trails for a lost friend.
