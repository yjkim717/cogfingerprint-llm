That first-time homebuyer feeling in 2022—excitement mixed with a healthy dose of mortgage-induced anxiety. I remember staring at that email: a $345 rate lock extension fee because our closing got pushed back. My stomach dropped. Do I pay it, or gamble that rates won’t climb higher?

It felt like a high-stakes game show where the prize was my future living room. With inflation soaring and the Fed hiking rates, it wasn't just a fee; it was paying for peace of mind. I wrote the check, swallowing the cost but preserving my sanity. Sometimes, the real cost isn't the dollar amount—it's the weight of the "what if" you choose to carry.
