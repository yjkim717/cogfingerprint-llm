The salty breeze, the rhythmic crash of waves—it’s funny how the water calls to you, isn’t it? After years of casual sailing, I found myself craving something new in 2022, something to shake up my weekends. Windsurfing and wingfoiling both whispered promises of freedom, but which path to take?

I pictured myself gliding effortlessly on a foil, lifted by the wind like a seabird—wingfoiling seemed so futuristic, so smooth. But then I remembered the raw, physical dance of windsurfing, the familiar tug of the sail. It wasn’t just about gear or transport; it was about how I wanted to feel on the water.

In the end, I realized it’s not about choosing the “better” sport, but the one that fits your spirit. For me, that meant embracing the learning curve and finding joy in the journey itself. Sometimes, the best adventure is the one that makes you feel alive, right where you are.
