**The Great Orange Experiment of â€˜22**

Okay, letâ€™s be honest, 2022 was a year for impulsive decisions. I dove headfirst into a DIY root touch-up with Ardell Gray Magic, convinced I could master the art of a seamless blend.

Itâ€™s taught me a valuable lesson about embracing the unexpected and that sometimes, a little color chaos is exactly what you need.  Anyone else have a 2022 hair mishap theyâ€™re willing to share? ðŸ§¡
