## The Year I Stopped Trying to Do *Everything* (and Actually Got Things Done)

Okay, let's be honest. 2022 felt… a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. I think we can all agree on that, right? The world felt perpetually on the edge of something, and I felt like I was trying to juggle a million different balls, all while riding a unicycle.  My to-do list was a sprawling, intimidating beast, and I was constantly feeling behind, even when I was technically "doing" things.

I was chasing shiny objects. A new online course on pottery (because, why not?), finally organizing the linen closet (a monumental task!), perfecting my sourdough starter (it mostly just gave me dense, sour bread).  All well and good, I guess, but none of it felt truly *meaningful*.  And it certainly didn't feel like it was moving me closer to the things I actually *wanted* to achieve.

Then, I stumbled across this idea – the Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule. The concept is simple: roughly 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts.  It’s a surprisingly powerful thought when you’re drowning in a sea of tasks. Suddenly, the linen closet felt… less important.

It made me really examine *what* I was spending my time on versus *why* I was spending my time on it.  What were the vital few things that genuinely mattered? For me, it was writing – actually finishing that novel I’d been chipping away at for years – and deepening my relationships with my closest friends and family.  Everything else felt like… noise.

It wasn’t an instant transformation, of course.  There were still days where I got sucked into the vortex of minor tasks. But I started consciously asking myself, "Is this 20% effort?"  If the answer was no, I actively tried to delegate, postpone, or just… let it go.

The shift was incredible.  Suddenly, I had *time*. Time to write. Time to call my mom. Time to just… *be*.  And the quality of the work I *was* doing improved dramatically.  Because I wasn’t spread so thin, I could focus, I could breathe, I could actually *craft* something I was proud of.

This year has taught me that productivity isn't about doing *more*. It's about doing the *right* things. It’s about recognizing that not all tasks are created equal, and that focusing on the 20% that truly matters can unlock a level of fulfillment and progress you never thought possible.  

It’s a constant reminder to be intentional, to say "no" to the things that don't align with my core goals, and to fiercely protect the time and energy I dedicate to what *does*.  And honestly, my sourdough starter is still a disaster. But I'm okay with that now.  There are more important things to knead.
