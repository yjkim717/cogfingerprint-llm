**The Month My Gut Decided to Stage a Protest**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt like a year of “almost.” Almost feeling good, almost hitting my goals, and for a frustrating month, almost entirely dominated by an IBS flare-up. It hit me like a wave – bloating, stomach cramps, the whole shebang. 

I spent weeks feeling miserable, scrolling through endless Reddit threads like the one I stumbled upon, desperately seeking a lifeline.  Suddenly, the fodmap diet felt less like a trendy buzzword and more like a potential key to unlocking some relief. It’s a long road, but learning to listen to my body and prioritize gut health feels incredibly important.  Anyone else have a similar experience?
