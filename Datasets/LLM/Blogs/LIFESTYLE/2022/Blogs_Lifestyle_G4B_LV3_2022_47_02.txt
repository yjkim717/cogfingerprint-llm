**The Year I Learned to Actually *Do* Things**

2022 felt… chaotic, didn’t it? Between the lingering effects of the pandemic and a general sense of needing to “catch up,” I found myself drowning in a sea of to-dos. I was busy, *really* busy, but I wasn’t actually accomplishing anything that truly mattered. I was just…reacting. 

It hit me one evening, staring at a mountain of undone tasks, that I’d been completely off track. I’d been chasing a million little things, convinced that if I just did *everything*, I’d finally feel productive.  It was exhausting and, honestly, a little pathetic.

That’s when I stumbled across the Pareto Principle – the idea that roughly 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Suddenly, it clicked. I started ruthlessly prioritizing.  What were the *main things*? The tasks that, if tackled, would genuinely move the needle? 

I started saying "no" more often, letting go of commitments that drained my energy without adding value. It wasn’t easy, but it was liberating. Focusing on that vital 20% – whether it was finally finishing a long-delayed project or simply carving out time for a creative pursuit – created a surprising ripple effect. 

It wasn’t about doing *more*, it was about doing *better*.  And honestly, learning to focus felt like a small revolution in my daily life.  What’s one thing *you’re* going to focus on this week?
