**Lost in a World of Wool and Magic**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple desire – a need for a new cardigan – can lead you down such a delightfully winding path? Lately, I’ve been completely absorbed in finding the *perfect* pattern, something that feels like it belongs in a fantasy novel. I’m channeling my D&D wizard, all flowing robes and ancient wisdom, through a series of intricate knitting projects. Ravelry has become my happy place! It’s a cozy escape, and a reminder that a little bit of crafted magic can brighten any day.
