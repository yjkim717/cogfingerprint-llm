## The Suitcase and the Trail: Finding Balance in a Constant State of Motion

It's November 2022, and I'm sitting on a delayed flight to Chicago, staring out the window at a grey, drizzly tarmac. Another conference, another string of meetings, another week away from home. And, if I'm being honest, another week where my training feels like it’s teetering on the edge.

You see, I'm a bit of a contradiction. By day, I’m navigating spreadsheets and presentations, hustling in a corporate world that demands long hours and constant travel. By night (and early mornings, and stolen moments whenever I can squeeze them in), I'm a trail runner, chasing endorphins and pushing my physical limits. Specifically, I’m working toward a 50-miler next spring, and the idea of it feels both exhilarating and utterly terrifying.

Balancing the two? Let’s just say it’s a work in progress. This year has been a particularly brutal test. I’ve missed runs, shortened runs, and occasionally resorted to hotel treadmill workouts that feel more like punishment than progress. There have been days I’ve felt guilty for even *wanting* to run, questioning if I should just accept that this year's goal might be unrealistic.

But then, I remember why I do it. It's not just about the race. It's about the feeling of connection with the earth, the quiet strength I find pushing through discomfort, the mental clarity that comes after hours on the trail. It's a vital reset button in a life that often feels overwhelmingly… digital.

So, I'm learning to be more intentional. Squeezing in a quick run around a new city, prioritizing early morning workouts before the day's chaos begins, and being okay with adjusting my expectations. Maybe this year’s 50-miler won’t be a PR. Maybe it'll just be a finish. 

And you know what? That’s okay too. Because the real victory isn't always about the finish line. It's about finding a way to honor both the demands of my career *and* the pull of the trails, even when they feel worlds apart.  Anyone else out there juggling a similar life? Let’s commiserate (and share tips!) in the comments.
