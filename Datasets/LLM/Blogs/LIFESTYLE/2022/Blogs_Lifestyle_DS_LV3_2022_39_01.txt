It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my university’s “equitable access” textbook policy. Do I keep it or opt out? I’m trying to be practical, weighing which classes actually use the materials. Then there’s this one course with a “response session” that supposedly requires the book. But will we really use it, or is it just another line on the syllabus? It feels like a gamble, trying to balance cost with being prepared. A small decision, yet it speaks to a larger student struggle.
