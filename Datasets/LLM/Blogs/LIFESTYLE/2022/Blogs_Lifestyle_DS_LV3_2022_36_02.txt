It’s 2022, and my Galaxy S9—the unlocked Latin American variant—has become a source of daily frustration. On Verizon’s network, it drops 4G LTE constantly, leaving me stranded mid-conversation or while checking directions. Since the 3G shutdown, it’s like my phone’s lost its way home, a constant reminder of how dependent we’ve become on seamless connectivity. It’s more than a glitch; it’s a lesson in how the tech we trust can quietly disconnect us from the world.
