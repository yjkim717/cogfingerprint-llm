You know what’s been bugging me lately? Watching celebrity chefs pop up with these flashy vegan specials, only to flip back to sizzling steaks the next episode. It feels so… disingenuous. Like, I’m all for promoting plant-based eating, but let’s be real—these chefs aren’t inventing lentil loaf or jackfruit tacos. They’re borrowing from a movement that’s been thriving for years, built by passionate home cooks and dedicated vegans.

It’s 2022, and we’re surrounded by incredible meat substitutes and creative recipes that have been carefully crafted long before it became a trendy TV segment. So when these chefs take a bow for a "vegan revolution," it just feels like they’re cashing in on someone else’s hard work. Give credit where it’s due, you know?
