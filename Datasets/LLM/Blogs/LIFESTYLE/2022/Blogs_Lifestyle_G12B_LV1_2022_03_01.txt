## Trading Cubicle Walls for Stargazing: My Year of Uncertainty and a Van

Okay, deep breath. It feels weird putting this out there, but here it is: I sold almost everything I own and bought a van. 

I know, I know. It sounds cliché, right? Another millennial chasing the Instagram dream of sunsets and freedom. The truth is, it’s a *lot* more complicated than that. And, honestly, it started with a really hard realization: I was profoundly unhappy.

For years, I'd been grinding. Corporate job, climbing the ladder, the whole nine yards. It wasn't *bad*, per se. It was…numb. I felt like a cog in a machine, trading my time and energy for a paycheck that mostly just paid bills and anxiety. And then, about a year ago, things came to a head. I hit a wall. A big, ugly, brick wall of burnout and questioning everything.

Around the same time, I made another significant shift – a commitment to sobriety. It’s a journey, and it's still ongoing, but it’s been the most empowering and clarifying thing I’ve ever done. Facing my dependencies forced me to look at the patterns, the routines, the habits that weren't serving me. And that corporate life? It was fueling a lot of it.

So, I started thinking. What *did* serve me? What did I truly *want*? The answer, surprisingly, wasn't a corner office or a bigger salary. It was…space. Freedom. A connection to something real, something beyond spreadsheets and conference calls.

That’s where the vanlife thing crept in. I’d been idly scrolling through Instagram, seeing those stunning images of vans parked in remote locations, people living minimally and seemingly effortlessly. I initially dismissed it as just another curated online fantasy. But the more I thought about it, the more it resonated. It felt like a physical manifestation of the freedom I was craving.

The practicalities, of course, were terrifying. I'm a spreadsheet person, remember? I'm used to predictability and structure. This...this was the opposite.  But I’d also spent the last few months building a solid foundation of remote work, thanks to a fortunate shift in my company's policies. I'm a freelance writer now, which is a huge leap of faith, but it allows me to work from anywhere with Wi-Fi (a crucial detail for vanlife, obviously).

The van itself was a project. I found a slightly beat-up Ford Transit, a blank canvas really.  The conversion process has been a crash course in carpentry, electrical wiring, and YouTube tutorials. Let me tell you, there's a *lot* of learning when you're trying to build a tiny home on wheels. It's been frustrating,
