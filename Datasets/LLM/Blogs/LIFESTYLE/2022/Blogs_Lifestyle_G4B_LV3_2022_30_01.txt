**The Ghosts in My Box Camera**

Remember those moments where a simple image can transport you back in time? It happened to me recently, watching *Mad Men* and spotting a Polaroid – a genuine, faded Polaroid – and it hit me with a wave of nostalgia. It wasn’t just the aesthetic; it was a tangible link to my grandfather.

He gave me his old camera for my 16th birthday. A vintage beauty, heavy in my hands, with a satisfying click that felt like a secret handshake. It’s now a family heirloom, tucked away in a box, a silent witness to years gone by.  

There’s something profoundly sad about these things, isn’t there?  How quickly technology fades, how easily memories can be lost.  I find myself carefully cleaning the lens, trying to coax it back to life, partly to preserve the *idea* of him, and partly to hold onto a piece of that past. 

It’s a quiet obsession, really – a reminder that the most valuable treasures aren't always shiny new gadgets, but the echoes of those who came before us, captured in a single, imperfect frame.
