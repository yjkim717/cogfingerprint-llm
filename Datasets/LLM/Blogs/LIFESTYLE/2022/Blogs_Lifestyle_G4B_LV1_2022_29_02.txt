**The Weight of Sharing**

It’s 2022, and I’m still learning to navigate this whole bipolar thing. Honestly, talking about it with friends felt… daunting. Initially, I’d share a fleeting mood swing, and the response was often awkward. Suddenly, I was *the bipolar friend*, and the easy camaraderie vanished. I started pulling back, feeling this awful loneliness creep in.
