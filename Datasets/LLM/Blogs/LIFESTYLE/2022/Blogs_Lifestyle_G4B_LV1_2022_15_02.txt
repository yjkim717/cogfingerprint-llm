**Scrolling Through a Worry**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we share snippets of our lives online? I was scrolling through Instagram last week, and a friend posted a photo of her niece – a beautiful little girl, maybe six years old.  Suddenly, a little knot tightened in my stomach. It wasn’t about the photo itself, but the *potential* of it. 

We talk so much about online safety, about digital ethics, but it’s easy to get caught up in the moment.  I remembered reading something recently about the serious risks involved with sharing images of minors, the legal ramifications and the sheer vulnerability it creates. 

It made me think about how quickly things spread online – a single post can reach hundreds, even thousands, of people.  It struck me that protecting children online isn’t just about blocking websites; it’s about a conscious decision to be thoughtful about what we share and what we ask for.  A small pause, a moment of reflection, can make a huge difference.  Let’s be mindful, okay?
