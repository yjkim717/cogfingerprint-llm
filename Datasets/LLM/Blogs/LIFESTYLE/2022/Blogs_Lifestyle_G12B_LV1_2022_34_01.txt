>## The Spreadsheet and the Sanity: Rethinking Our Healthcare

Okay, so I've officially become *that* person. The one buried in spreadsheets, obsessing over deductibles and premiums. But hear me out, it’s not entirely unpleasant. It’s actually a surprisingly revealing look at how we manage our finances, and a bit of a rebellion against the autopilot we often find ourselves on.

We're a family of four, and for years, we’ve blindly accepted our employer's health insurance plan. It seemed easiest, right? Less thinking, less hassle. But 2022 felt… different. Inflation hit hard, and suddenly those seemingly reasonable monthly premiums felt heavier. 

So, I started digging. I started comparing our current plan – with its copays and deductibles – to the possibility of going with a self-sourced plan. It's been a deep dive into health savings accounts (HSAs) and the nuances of adjusted gross income (AGI) tax deductions. Honestly, it’s a little overwhelming!

It’s more than just the money, though. It’s about control. About understanding where our money is going and making a conscious choice. It's about questioning the default settings of our lives. We're still crunching the numbers, but the process itself has been surprisingly empowering. It's a reminder that even small shifts in how we approach our finances can lead to a greater sense of financial wellbeing. And honestly, a little spreadsheet-induced stress is worth it if it leads to a little more peace of mind.
