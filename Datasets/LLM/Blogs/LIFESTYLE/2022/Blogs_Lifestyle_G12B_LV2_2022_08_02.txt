>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational tone, set in 2022. I've focused on the *feeling* of the situation rather than just a recounting of events, and tried to weave in broader reflections on family dynamics.

## The Walls Between Us: When "Close" Feels Like Too Much

Okay, I need to talk about something. Something that’s been simmering under the surface for a while, and this weekend… well, this weekend it boiled over. It’s about family. Specifically, it’s about the delicate, often treacherous, terrain of in-laws.

I love my husband's family. Truly. They're good people, generous, and have always welcomed me. But there’s this… *thing* with his mom. It's a pattern. A constant hum of needing to know, needing to be involved, needing to… well, needing. And it’s exhausting.

This weekend, we’d invited his parents over. We’ve been trying to navigate this for years – a conscious effort to maintain a healthy balance. We live in a duplex, which, in theory, is amazing. Close enough for spontaneous visits and shared barbecues, but with the blessed, glorious separation of our own space.  It *should* be idyllic.

Instead, it felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells. Every decision, every conversation, felt like it was being subtly scrutinized. "Are you sure you're doing that right?" "We always did it this way…"  The casual suggestions morphed into gentle directives, and the gentle directives… well, you get the picture.

It’s not malicious, I don’t think. It’s just… ingrained. My husband has often talked about how close his family is, how they’ve always been involved in each other’s lives. And in some ways, that's beautiful. But for someone like me, someone who values independence and personal space, it can feel suffocating. It feels like lines are blurred, boundaries are… porous. I've been reading a lot about "enmeshment" lately – that feeling of being emotionally tangled up with someone else, losing a sense of your own identity. It feels eerily accurate.

I found myself snapping, which is *never* my style. I retreated to my side of the duplex, pretending to be engrossed in a book, just needing a pocket of quiet.  My husband, bless his heart, tried to mediate. But it’s not something he can *fix*. It's a deeply rooted dynamic, and he's caught in the middle, trying to honor both his mother and his wife.

The thing is, I’m not trying to push them away. I genuinely want a positive relationship. But I also need to protect my own mental and emotional well-being. I need to define and enforce boundaries. It's so incredibly hard, especially when the person you're setting the boundary with is someone you're supposed to love and respect.

This whole experience has made me think a lot about the expectations we place on family, particularly the idea that “close” automatically equates to “healthy.”  I
