As I binge-watched my favorite shows in 2022, I couldn't help but think about the next obsession. Will it be Andor, diving deeper into the Star Wars universe, or House of the Dragon, revisiting the Game of Thrones world? As a Patreon supporter, I'm eager to see what's next. The anticipation is thrilling, and I'm excited to share my thoughts with fellow fans. What will be the next show to captivate us?
