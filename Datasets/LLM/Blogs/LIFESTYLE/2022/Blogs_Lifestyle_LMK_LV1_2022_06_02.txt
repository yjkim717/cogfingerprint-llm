As I excitedly clicked "buy now" on the Google Store, I thought I was getting a sweet deal on my new Pixel 7 and Pixel Watch. I'd traded in my old phone and was expecting a smooth transaction. But, boy, was I wrong! When I received my new devices, I was surprised to see that the trade-in credit hadn't been applied as I expected. Instead of getting a discount on my Pixel 7, the credit was split between the phone and the watch. I felt misled - had I misunderstood the trade-in process? After some digging, I realized that the Google Store's checkout process was deceptive, and I wasn't alone in my confusion. It's 2022, and you'd think tech giants would do better. I'm still enjoying my new devices, but I'm left wondering how many others have fallen victim to this confusing sales tactic. Has anyone else had a similar experience?
