**The Tightrope Walk: When Love Feels Like a Trap**

2022 felt…complicated, didn’t it? Like everyone was navigating a landscape of shifting rules and unexpected turbulence. And honestly, a lot of that turbulence stemmed from a relationship I’d been wrestling with for far too long – my ex and my son. It wasn’t a dramatic, explosive breakup; it was a slow, insidious creep of something deeply unhealthy.

Looking back, I realize we were caught in a classic case of enmeshment. My ex, bless his heart, had always been intensely involved in my son’s life, and after the split, that involvement didn't fade. It intensified. He’d constantly ‘check in,’ offering unsolicited advice on everything from school projects to friendships, all while subtly implying that *he* knew best. 

It felt less like support and more like a constant infringement on our boundaries. And let's be honest, it quickly morphed into manipulation.  His ‘concern’ was often a way to maintain control, to keep me feeling like I couldn't fully parent my son independently. 

I spent months feeling guilty, questioning my decisions, and desperately trying to appease him. I was walking a tightrope, trying to honor his involvement while fiercely protecting my son’s autonomy and my own sense of self.  It was exhausting.

What I’ve learned – and it’s a lesson that’s still unfolding – is that healthy relationships, even those involving children, *require* clear boundaries. They're not about shutting someone out; they’re about defining where you end and they begin.  

Communication, too, became the key.  I finally had to articulate – calmly, firmly, and repeatedly – what I needed. It wasn’t easy, and there were definitely pushback moments. But establishing those boundaries, and learning to communicate my needs with confidence, has been profoundly liberating. It’s allowed my son to develop a stronger sense of self, and it’s given me the space to truly be *his* mother, not just an extension of his father.
