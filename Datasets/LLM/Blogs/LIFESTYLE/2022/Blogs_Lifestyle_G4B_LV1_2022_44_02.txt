**The Weight of a Good Deed**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we get so hung up on *how* we do things, rather than just… doing them. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with this idea, sparked by a really unsettling piece I read about Compound V – basically, a way to essentially erase villains. Sounds good, right?  

But the argument kept circling back to this uncomfortable truth: if you remove the bad, you automatically reduce the potential for bad *things* to happen. It felt like a slippery slope. 

I keep thinking about my brother, Hugie, and that disastrous attempt to “fix” a family argument last year. We tried to control every interaction, to steer it towards a “better” outcome. It backfired spectacularly.  It reminded me that sometimes, even with the best intentions, trying to engineer a perfect life – or a perfect world – just creates more problems.  Maybe “the boys” – my family – were better off just letting things unfold, messy as it was. 2022 is teaching me that.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way (e.g., adjust the length, change the tone, or focus on a specific aspect)?
