**The 700 Score Shuffle: Is NYC Really Shutting Us Out?**

Okay, let’s be honest, scrolling through apartment listings in NYC in 2022 feels a little…grim. It’s not just the prices anymore, it’s the relentless demand for a 700 credit score. Seriously, where does that even come from?  I recently had a particularly frustrating experience applying for a place in the West Village – a solid tenant history, a decent job, and *poof* – rejected because my score was a few points shy.

It’s starting to feel incredibly unfair. Like we’re being judged on a single number, ignoring the bigger picture.  I’ve been diving into some articles about housing reform and financial literacy, realizing this isn’t just about landlords; it’s about systemic barriers.  It’s about how a small credit slip can completely derail your dreams of finding a home in this city.  Anyone else feeling this pressure?  Let's talk about it. #NYCrentals #CreditScore #HousingCrisis
