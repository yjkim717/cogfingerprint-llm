It all started with that little jar of homemade teriyaki sauce tucked in the back of my fridge. I’d almost forgotten about it until a craving for stir-fry hit last week. To my surprise, it was still perfect—nearly a year later. That discovery in 2022 felt like uncovering a secret superpower in my own kitchen.

It got me thinking: what other flavor-packed treasures could I create that stand the test of time? I began experimenting with zesty salsas and crisp, tangy pickles, each batch a small victory against food waste and bland meals. Now, my refrigerator shelves are lined with these homemade gems, ready to transform a simple dish into something special on a whim. It’s amazing how a bit of foresight can fill your everyday meals with so much more joy and flavor.
