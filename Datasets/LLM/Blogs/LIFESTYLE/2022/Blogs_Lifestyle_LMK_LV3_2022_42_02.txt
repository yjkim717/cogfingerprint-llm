The Chaos of a Holiday Weekend: A Retail Reality Check

As I stood behind the counter in the meat department on that sweltering 4th of July weekend in 2022, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over me. The store was slammed, and customers were lining up with special requests left and right. "Can you cut this exactly 1/4 inch thick?" or "I need it wrapped in a specific way." Don't get me wrong, I get it - customers want their needs met. But on a day when we're already running on fumes, it's tough to keep a smile on our faces. As a retail worker, I've learned to roll with the punches, but days like these make me wonder: can't customers just plan ahead? A little understanding goes a long way in making our jobs (and our lives) a whole lot easier. By being considerate of the chaos that comes with busy weekends, we can all have a more enjoyable experience.
