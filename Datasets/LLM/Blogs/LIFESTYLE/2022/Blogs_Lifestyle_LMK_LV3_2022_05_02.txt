The Frustrating Lag in My Gaming World. As an avid PC gamer, I was excited to dive into Elden Ring in 2022. However, my enthusiasm was short-lived when I started experiencing extreme lag while using my PS5 controller. At first, I thought it was just a minor glitch, but the issue persisted, disrupting my gaming flow. After some tinkering, I discovered that the PS5 controller's motion sensor might be the culprit. It was a frustrating revelation, as I'd grown accustomed to the controller's innovative features. I began to wonder if the extra functionality was worth the trade-off in performance. This hiccup made me reflect on the balance between cutting-edge technology and seamless gaming experiences. As I seek a solution, I'm reminded that sometimes, the latest features can come at a cost â€“ and it's up to us to weigh the pros and cons.
