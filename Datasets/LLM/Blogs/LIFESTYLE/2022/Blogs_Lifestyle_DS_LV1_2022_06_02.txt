### The Day My Digital Detox Backfired

It was early 2022, and I was determined to be more mindful with my tech. My old phone was a constant distraction, so the plan was simple: trade it in for Google’s new bundle—a Pixel phone and a sleek Pixel Watch to help me track my wellness, not my notifications.

The promise of a trade-in credit felt like a win-win. I pictured that credit as a little digital reward, a pat on the back for making a conscious choice. I’d use it to offset the cost of my new, streamlined life.

But the reality hit after the purchase. That promised credit? It only applied to the phone, not the watch. Suddenly, my mindful upgrade felt like a deceptive sales tactic. Instead of feeling refreshed, I was frustrated, trying to get a refund for the difference.

It was a stark lesson. In my quest to disconnect from digital noise, I’d walked right into a different kind of modern trap. Sometimes, the most mindful purchase is the one you don't make.
