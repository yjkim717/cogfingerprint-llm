## The Quiet Security of a Locked Box (and My NAS)

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with something lately – a quiet, persistent worry about the data on my home NAS. It’s a Debian box, running pretty smoothly, but the thought of all those files just… sitting there, unencrypted, felt increasingly unsettling in 2022. 

I'm trying to layer in some extra security, specifically moving my /root partition to a Luks-encrypted disk. Sounds technical, right? It is! But I'm determined. The question I've been circling is whether I can pull this off with a simple fstab entry. 

It’s more than just a technical challenge, though. It's about feeling like I'm actively protecting something valuable – years of photos, documents, the digital life I've built. It's a small project, but it represents a larger shift towards a more mindful approach to digital security. Wish me luck!
