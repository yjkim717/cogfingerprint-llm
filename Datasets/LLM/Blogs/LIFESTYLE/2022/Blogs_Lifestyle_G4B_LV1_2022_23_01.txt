**Trying to Juggle Everything: UF Life in 2022**

Okay, real talk – this semester at UF is *intense*. I’m seriously battling it out with EEL3872 and ALS3200C, both absolutely brutal. And on top of that, I’m working two jobs just to make it. It’s exhausting, honestly. I’m starting to realize that “adulting” is a lot more than just picking a major. It's about finding a way to prioritize, say "no" sometimes, and remember to breathe. Send coffee! ☕️ #UFstudent #college life #struggleisreal
