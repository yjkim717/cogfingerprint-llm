### The Movie in My Mind: My Secret Weapon Against a Drink

It’s 2022, and on the surface, my life looks pretty calm. I work from home, have a dog who thinks my keyboard is a bed, and my biggest daily crisis is whether the grocery delivery will include the right kind of oat milk. But sometimes, out of nowhere, a thought hits me with the force of a physical blow: *A cold, crisp glass of white wine would be perfect right now.*

It’s not just a thought; it’s a full-sensory memory. I can almost feel the chill of the glass and taste the first sharp sip. A few years ago, that thought would have been a command. I’d have opened the bottle, and that would be that. The story would be written.

Now, I have a different tool. I call it “playing the movie.” I don’t just acknowledge the craving; I invite it in and force it to watch the whole feature film, not just the tempting trailer.

So, I close my eyes. The first scene is lovely—me, smiling, sipping that wine, feeling a wave of relaxation. This is the part my brain wants to sell me on. But I don’t stop the film there. I let it roll.

The one glass becomes two. Then, I’m not sipping anymore; I’m drinking. The relaxation morphs into a familiar, buzzing numbness. I’m scrolling through my phone, texting people I haven’t spoken to in years, my messages becoming increasingly slurred and nonsensical. The anxiety I was trying to quell starts to roar back, louder now, fueled by the very thing I used to quiet it.

Then comes the climax I always dreaded: the blackout. The film cuts to static. The next scene is the morning after. I’m waking up fully clothed, my head pounding, with that gut-wrenching, soul-crushing fear. What did I say? Who did I text? What did I break? I’d reach for my phone like it was a live grenade, terrified of the evidence I’d find.

I open my eyes. The craving is still there, but it’s lost its power. It’s just a ghost now, because I’ve just confronted it with the vivid, painful reality of what it truly offers. It’s not offering me relaxation or fun; it’s offering me a one-way ticket back to that morning of shame and fear.

This little mental exercise is the cornerstone of my recovery. It’s not about white-knuckling through a desire. It’s about being brutally, compassionately honest with myself. By playing the tape all the way to the end, I choose the messy, beautiful reality of my sober life over the seductive lie of that first sip. And for today, that choice feels like a victory.
