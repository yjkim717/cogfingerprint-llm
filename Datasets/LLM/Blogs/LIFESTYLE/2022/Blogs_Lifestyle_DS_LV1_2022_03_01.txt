Of all the questions people ask me about this new life, the one that lands with the most weight is also the simplest: “Aren’t you scared?”

It’s 2022. I’m sitting in a half-converted Chevy Express in a friend’s driveway, surrounded by rolls of Reflectix, a jigsaw, and the ghost of my old life. The question hangs in the air, mingling with the scent of fresh-cut lumber and my own anxiety. *Aren’t you scared?* My answer is always a variation of the same theme: “Terrified. But I was more scared of staying still.”

Eight months ago, I got sober. It wasn't a dramatic, rock-bottom moment, but a quiet, bone-deep exhaustion. The person I saw in the mirror—the one using substances to blur the edges of a dysphoria I couldn't yet name—was a tenant in a life that wasn't hers. Sobriety didn't just mean putting down the bottle; it meant picking up the pieces of a self I was finally ready to meet. And she, it turns out, is a woman who needs to move.

The van idea started as a doodle, a fantasy of escape. But as the fog of addiction lifted, it solidified into a blueprint for survival. I work remotely as a graphic designer, a job that once felt like a cage but now feels like a key. It’s the thread that connects this wild idea to financial reality. The plan is simple, almost monastic: a platform bed, a small desk for my laptop, a portable power station, and a single cabinet for my clothes and a kettle. No elaborate sink, no shower, no Instagram-worthy interior. This isn't #VanLife for the 'gram; it's Van Life for the soul.

But the fears are real, and they are layered. As a trans woman, the calculus of safety is a constant, low-grade hum in the back of my mind. Where do I park? Who is around me? Will a knock on my door be a curious neighbor or something more sinister? The concept of "stealth camping"—blending in, looking like just another work van in a Walmart parking lot or a quiet suburban street—isn't just a cool trick for free camping. For me, it’s a survival strategy. It’s about being invisible on purpose, a paradox I’m all too familiar with.

This is where "boondocking" calls to me—the practice of camping for free, away from developed campgrounds, out on public lands. It’s the dream: waking up to a desert sunrise with no one else for miles. The silence, the space, the sheer, unadulterated freedom of it. Out there, the only thing I have to fear is the weather or a curious coyote. The social fears melt away under a vast, starry sky. It’s the ultimate goal, the sanctuary I’m driving toward.

Yet, the practicalities are a daily meditation. Every choice in this build is a question of weight, both physical and metaphorical. Do I need this extra storage bin? Is this tool essential? Each pound I add is gas I’ll burn, momentum I’ll lose. It mirrors the sobriety journey in an uncanny way. I’m shedding not just possessions, but the heavy, cumbersome baggage of a life lived for others. The performance of being someone I wasn’t was the heaviest thing I’ve ever carried.

There’s a profound freedom in this minimalism. When all you have is a 60-square-foot space, every item must earn its keep. There’s no room for "just in case" or for the ghosts of past hobbies. It forces a brutal and beautiful honesty. The same honesty I’m trying to apply to my own identity. Who am I, stripped of the societal expectations, the liquid courage, the clutter? The van is becoming the physical container for that answer.

I think about the rhythm of this new life. My workday will end, and instead of a commute to a lonely apartment, I’ll simply close my laptop. My "commute" will be a walk into a pine forest or a stroll along a secluded beach. The line between work and life won't be a wall, but a gentle, permeable membrane. The reward for a day of designing logos and layouts won't be a drink; it will be the view outside my sliding door.

So, am I scared?

Yes. I’m scared of breakdowns in the middle of nowhere. I’m scared of lonely nights where the silence feels oppressive instead of peaceful. I’m scared of the unknown reactions my identity might provoke.

But I stack those fears against the ones I’m leaving behind. The fear of never truly knowing myself. The fear of a life half-lived, numbed into submission. The fear of the slow, quiet decay of staying in a place that never felt like home.

This van, this rolling, minimalist shell, is more than a vehicle. It’s a declaration. It’s me saying that my safety, my peace, and my truth are worth the risk. It’s me choosing the uncertainty of the open road over the certain misery of a stagnant life.

The build is almost done. The final piece of cork flooring is waiting to be laid. Soon, the driveway will empty, and my new home will hit the road. I don't know exactly where I'm going, but for the first time, that feels like the whole point. The road ahead is a question mark, and I’m finally ready to write the answer, one sober, intentional mile at a time.
