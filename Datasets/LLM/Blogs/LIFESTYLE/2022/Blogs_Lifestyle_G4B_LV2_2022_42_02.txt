**The Weight of ‘Just One More’**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a seemingly simple weekend can feel utterly overwhelming. This past November, I was working at the grocery store, and it was *brutal*. A crazy busy holiday weekend, and everyone – and I mean *everyone* – wanted something specific. 

Requests for special orders, steak cutting requests, custom packaging… it just kept coming.  I remember feeling this growing frustration, this urge to just say, “I need a minute!” But the faces, the polite (and not-so-polite) requests… it was exhausting. 

It made me think about how we often place so much pressure on ourselves and others to constantly say ‘yes.’  Sometimes, it’s okay to prioritize your own energy.  A little boundary setting can feel incredibly liberating, right?  What’s one "just one more" you can say no to this week?
