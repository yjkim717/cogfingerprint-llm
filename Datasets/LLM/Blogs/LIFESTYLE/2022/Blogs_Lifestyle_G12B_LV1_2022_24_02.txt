## The Performative Plate & My Growing Vegan Discomfort

It's 2022, and veganism feels... complicated. I've been exploring plant-based eating for a couple of years now, genuinely fascinated by the culinary possibilities and the ethical considerations. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with a weird feeling.

I've noticed a trend on cooking shows – chefs enthusiastically whipping up a vibrant vegan dish, then seamlessly transitioning to a perfectly seared steak five minutes later. It’s not that I begrudge anyone their carnivorous cravings, but the sudden shift feels…disingenuous. Like a performative nod to a growing movement, rather than genuine engagement. 

It almost feels dismissive of the incredible chefs and home cooks *solely* dedicated to pushing the boundaries of vegan cuisine. People putting their hearts and souls into developing innovative meat substitutes and plant-based masterpieces.  Are we celebrating inclusivity, or just ticking a box? I’m still figuring out my place in all of this, but I'm leaning towards supporting those who truly walk the vegan walk, not just briefly sample the plate.
