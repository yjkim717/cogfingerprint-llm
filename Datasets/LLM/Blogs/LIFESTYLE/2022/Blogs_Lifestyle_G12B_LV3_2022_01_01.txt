## My Unexpected Fragrance Dive (and What I've Learned!)

Okay, so here's a random thing I got *really* into this year: fragrance. Seriously, three months ago I barely wore cologne, and now? I’ve got a little collection brewing! Discovering scents like Millesime Imperial and Moustache EDP has been surprisingly captivating. Even a bit of a journey, really. Turns out, finding a scent you truly connect with is kind of like finding a new favorite song – unexpected, but totally worth it. (Though, Club de Nuit Intense Man? Not my vibe, haha!)
