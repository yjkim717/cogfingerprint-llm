## The Waiting Game & Letting Go (A Little Bit)

Remember that feeling of holding your breath? That’s pretty much been my life the past few weeks. We’re finally closing on our first house – a little fixer-upper we’re incredibly excited about – but the market's been…wild.

Our initial rate lock was supposed to be solid, but then rates started creeping up. Suddenly, we were staring down the barrel of an extension fee to keep our original rate. It felt like a gamble. Do we pay extra for a little security, or risk floating and hoping for a miracle?

It’s a strangely stressful parallel to life, isn’t it? We’re always trying to lock things in – relationships, career paths, even our expectations. But sometimes, clinging too tightly can cost you. Letting go, even a little, can open you up to unexpected possibilities. 

Honestly, we decided to let it float. It felt scary, but also liberating. We'll see what happens.  It’s a good reminder that not everything is within our control, and sometimes, the best thing you can do is just breathe and trust the process. 2022 has certainly taught us that!



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
