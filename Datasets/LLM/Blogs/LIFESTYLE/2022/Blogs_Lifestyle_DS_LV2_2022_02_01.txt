Of all the parenting challenges I braced for in 2022—the sleepless nights, the endless diapers—no one warned me about the Great Bubble Gum Antibiotic Standoff. There I was, locked in a battle of wills with my seven-month-old, a tiny human with the iron resolve of a seasoned negotiator.

The medicine was a cheerful, pink, bubble gum-flavored liquid, supposedly designed for infant palates. My daughter, however, treated it like poison. Every attempt ended the same way: a tightly clamped jaw, a dramatic shudder, and the pink syrup sprayed back at me like a tiny, defiant fountain. I tried mixing it with applesauce, which she then rejected forever. I tried singing songs, making silly faces—nothing.

The lowest point was attempting a gentle force-feed, holding her steady as she wailed. It felt awful, a violation of the trust I was trying so hard to build. I was covered in sticky, fake-bubble-gum goo, near tears myself, wondering if she’d ever get better if I couldn’t even do this one simple thing.

Then, in a moment of desperation, I dipped the tip of my clean finger in the medicine and offered it. She looked at me, suspicious, then gave it a tentative lick. And then another. It wasn't a magic cure, but it was a start. It taught me that sometimes, you have to drop the syringe and the schedule and just meet them where they are. Even if "where they are" is covered in bubble gum goo.
