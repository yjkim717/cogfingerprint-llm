## The Weight of Small Fixes (and a Slightly Wonky Garage Door)

It’s funny, isn't it, how life tends to mirror itself in the most unexpected places? Lately, I’ve been thinking about that a lot. Maybe it's just the general feeling of 2022 – a year that’s felt like a constant series of small adjustments, tiny calibrations, and the persistent feeling that *something* isn’t quite right.

It started with the garage door. Just a little hiccup, really. Sometimes it wouldn’t fully open, other times the carriage would bump the motor with this unsettling *thunk*. I initially dismissed it. "Old house stuff," I told myself. “It’ll sort itself out.”  But it didn’t.

Then I remembered a couple of years back, a particularly nasty winter storm that had warped the track a bit. We’d hammered it back into (somewhat) shape, and even applied some epoxy to hold it. I'd really hoped that would be the end of it. 

Now, I'm realizing this whole situation feels like a metaphor. Like all the little compromises we make, the quick fixes we apply to problems that linger beneath the surface.  We patch things up, hoping to avoid the bigger, more difficult conversations.  We tell ourselves things are "good enough."

The garage door still acts up, intermittently. It’s a constant reminder that sometimes, a quick epoxy fix isn't enough. Sometimes you need to really look at the underlying structure, the thresholds, the whole system, to understand why things aren't latching properly.

Maybe that’s what 2022 has been about for me - recognizing that some of my own "thresholds" need revisiting. Some of my own tracks need straightening.  It’s a little daunting, honestly. But also… maybe a little hopeful. Maybe acknowledging the wonkiness is the first step towards actually fixing it.
