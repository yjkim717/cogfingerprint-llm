>## The Weight of "What If?" and the Pull of Home

It's 2022, and life feels…heavy sometimes, doesn't it? Like you're carrying a backpack filled with decisions, each one a little stone adding to the weight. Lately, that backpack feels particularly full for me. We're facing a big one: a potential relocation.

The idea started innocently enough. My parents, bless their hearts, are getting older, and the thought of being closer – of being able to lend a hand, share Sunday dinners, simply *be there* – is incredibly appealing. It's a tug on the heartstrings I can’t ignore. My wife and I have talked about it, and rationally, it makes so much sense. More family support, a slower pace of life…the list goes on.

But then the "what ifs" creep in. What about our friends? We've built a solid community here, a network of people who feel like chosen family. The thought of disrupting those connections, of saying goodbye to familiar faces and shared laughter, is genuinely painful. And then there are the kids. They’re thriving here, in their schools, with their friends. Uprooting them? It feels…selfish, sometimes.

Honestly, the anxiety has been hitting hard. It’s layered on top of the usual parenthood exhaustion, making even simple tasks feel monumental. Some days, I just want to crawl under the covers and pretend the decision doesn’t exist. 

It's a constant balancing act – weighing the potential joys of being closer to family against the fear of losing what we've built. There's no easy answer, no guaranteed perfect outcome. All I know is, we’re trying to navigate this with open hearts, honest conversations, and a whole lot of hope that, whatever we decide, we’ll land on our feet. And maybe, just maybe, this heavy backpack will eventually feel a little lighter.
