>## The Dilemma of the Still Waters

It's 2022, and the water sports scene is exploding. I’ve spent years happily sailing – a traditional, peaceful pastime that fits my slower pace. But lately, I’ve been itching for something… more. Something with a bit more *oomph*. I've been eyeing windsurfing and, even more alluringly, wingfoiling.

The problem? I’m a sailor, not a windsurfer. The learning curve feels daunting, and the logistics are a headache. Hauling a windsurfing rig around feels like a major commitment. Wingfoiling, on the other hand, seems potentially more portable – a wing and board, easier to strap to the car roof? 

But then the slower speeds of wingfoiling nag at me. I crave that feeling of really *carving* across the water, the dynamic power of the wind. It’s a classic trade-off: convenience versus exhilaration. I’m currently leaning towards the wing, hoping to find a sweet spot between portability and a decent speed. Maybe I’ll just end up trying both! Any advice from those in the know is welcome - I'm officially feeling the pull of the waves.
