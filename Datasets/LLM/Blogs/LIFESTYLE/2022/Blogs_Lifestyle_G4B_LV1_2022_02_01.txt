**The Great Antibiotic Battle of 2022**

Let me tell you, 2022 felt like a year of tiny battles. Mostly, they were adorable – wrestling over bedtime, negotiating broccoli consumption. But there was *one* that stands out, a particularly frustrating skirmish: getting antibiotics to Leo. 

Our little seven-month-old decided, with a fierce, determined glare, that he absolutely, positively did *not* want to swallow the medicine. It wasn’t the taste, exactly – just… the sheer audacity of it! He’d spit it out, a tiny, indignant projectile, and then erupt into a full-blown, wailing fit. 

It was exhausting. And honestly, a little heartbreaking. I felt like a failure, like I couldn’t even soothe him properly. It made me realize how fiercely protective we are, how desperate to shield our babies from any discomfort. 

Looking back, I’m proud of us. We persevered, trying everything – warm milk, distraction, even a little bribery (don’t judge!).  It taught me a valuable lesson about letting go of control and trusting that he’d get through it, even if it meant a few tears along the way.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps create a different piece based on the same core idea?
