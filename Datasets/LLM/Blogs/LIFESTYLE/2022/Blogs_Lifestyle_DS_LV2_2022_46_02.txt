It’s 2022, and my 3D printer has become a demanding roommate. Last night, mid-print, it just stopped—waiting for me to intervene. I was downstairs, scrolling, completely oblivious.

It got me thinking: how often do we pause in our own lives, waiting for a signal to act, only for no one to notice? We need to build our own "Klipper"—a way to listen for those quiet calls for help, whether from a machine or our own weary minds. The real upgrade isn't automated living; it's mindful connection.
