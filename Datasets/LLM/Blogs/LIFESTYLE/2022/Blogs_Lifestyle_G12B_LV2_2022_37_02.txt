## Lost in Loops & Lore

Isn't it funny how hobbies bloom? Lately, I've been completely absorbed in knitting – specifically, searching for cardigan patterns with a touch of…well, *magic*. It all started with a silly D&D character, a rogue-ish wizard, really. Now I’m dreaming of elvish-inspired knits. It’s a cozy escape, a little bit of fantasy woven into the everyday. Anyone else find their passions taking unexpected turns?




I hope this suits your needs! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
