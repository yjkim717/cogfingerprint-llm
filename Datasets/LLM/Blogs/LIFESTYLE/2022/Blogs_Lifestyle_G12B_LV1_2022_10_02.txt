## The Day I Really *Saw* It

It's funny, isn’t it? How easily we can get caught up in the *now*. The little cravings, the fleeting anxieties, the immediate desire for… well, whatever it is we’re chasing. For me, for a long time, that 'whatever' was a glass of wine. Then two. Then a bottle. Then… a whole lot more.

I'm coming up on three years sober this December. Three years of navigating life without that familiar chemical crutch. And honestly, some days it still feels like a monumental achievement. Other days, I almost forget how desperately I needed to change.

I remember vividly when the shift really started. It wasn't a sudden epiphany, more like a slow, creeping awareness. I'd been going through the motions of recovery, attending meetings, doing the work, but I wasn’t *feeling* it. I wasn’t truly connecting with the ‘why.’

Then, I stumbled upon this visualization technique. Someone at a meeting mentioned "playing the tape forward." The idea was simple, but profound: instead of focusing on the immediate urge, I should imagine where my choices would lead. Not just tomorrow, but weeks, months, even years down the line.

At first, it felt silly. Like some new-age woo-woo. But I was desperate, so I tried it.

I closed my eyes and pictured myself reaching for the bottle. I didn’t fight it, I just followed it. I saw myself arguing with my partner again, fueled by frustration and too much alcohol. I saw the missed opportunities at work, the projects I abandoned because I couldn't focus. I saw the isolation, the hollow feeling of relying on something that consistently let me down.  I even saw the familiar, creeping anxiety returning, stronger than before, needing to be numbed *again*.

The image wasn't glamorous. It wasn’t a dramatic downfall. It was just… a slow, steady erosion of everything I valued. A quiet decay of my life.

It was horrifying.

Suddenly, the craving didn't feel so urgent. The immediate gratification paled in comparison to the bleakness I had just witnessed. It was a stark, visual reminder of the price of that fleeting comfort.

Now, whenever a craving surfaces, I “play the tape forward.” It’s become a powerful tool, a way to reconnect with the commitment I made to myself. And it’s not just about avoiding alcohol. It’s about choosing a life filled with presence, connection, and genuine joy – a life I can actually *see* myself building, not just dreaming about. It's a constant gratitude practice. I’m still learning, still growing, but I’m incredibly grateful for the clarity this simple exercise has brought me. 2022 has been a good year, and I'm looking forward to what comes next, sober and seeing it clearly.
