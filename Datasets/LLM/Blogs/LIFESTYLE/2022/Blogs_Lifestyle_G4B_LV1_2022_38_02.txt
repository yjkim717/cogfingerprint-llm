**Dreaming of a Different Code**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2022 felt like a year of big questions. I spent a lot of time staring at job boards, specifically those listing Software Development roles, and thinking about *where* I wanted to build my career. A friend, fresh out of college, was asking about pursuing a CS degree overseas – the whole visa sponsorship and scholarship hunt. 

Suddenly, the idea of relocating felt less daunting and more… exciting. I started researching countries known for strong tech, picturing myself learning new languages and building a life alongside brilliant minds. It’s a leap, definitely, but a leap fueled by a desire to level up, both my skills and my perspective.
