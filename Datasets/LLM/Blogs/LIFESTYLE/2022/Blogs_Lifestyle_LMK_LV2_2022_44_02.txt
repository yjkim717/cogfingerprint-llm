"Finding My Moral Compass: Lessons from The Boys"

As I binge-watched The Boys in 2022, I couldn't help but reflect on my own moral stance. The show's portrayal of superheroes and their use of Compound V got me thinking - what's the line between right and wrong? MM and Starlight's conflicting views on the superpowered substance made me question my own values. In a world where power can be both a blessing and a curse, how do we make choices that align with our morals? The show highlights the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability. As I navigated my own life, I realized that being mindful of my actions and their consequences is key. It's a lesson I continue to learn and unlearn. The Boys may be a work of fiction, but its themes are all too real - and relatable.
