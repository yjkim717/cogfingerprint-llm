### The Weekend Everyone Wants a Perfect Steak

It was the Friday before the 4th of July, 2022, and our meat case looked like it had been raided by a pack of wolves. The sizzle of the holiday grill was on everyone's mind, and the pressure was on.

That’s when a customer waved me down, pointing past the empty trays. "Can you cut me two, two-inch thick ribeyes, but only from the very center of the loin? And can you tie them with butcher's twine?"

In that moment, I took a deep breath. I get it—you want the perfect centerpiece for your celebration. But so does the line of twenty people behind you. This weekend always reminds me that in retail, and maybe in life, a little planning and a lot of patience go a long, long way for everyone involved.
