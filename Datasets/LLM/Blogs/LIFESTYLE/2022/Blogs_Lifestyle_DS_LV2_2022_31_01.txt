That unexpected car repair last winter completely drained my emergency fund. I’ll admit, for months, I just ignored the zero balance—it felt too overwhelming to even think about rebuilding with everything getting more expensive. But that financial anxiety became a constant, low hum in the background of my life. This week, I finally sat down with my budget. Just putting a tiny, automatic transfer back in place has already lifted a weight off my shoulders. It’s not about being perfect; it’s about restarting the journey toward peace of mind.
