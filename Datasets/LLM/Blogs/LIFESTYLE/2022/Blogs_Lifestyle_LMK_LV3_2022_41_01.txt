Eminem's recent releases have left me nostalgic for his old flow. It seems like he's prioritizing multi-syllabic rhyming over crafting hits that stick. As someone who's grown up with his music, I yearn for the simplicity and memorability of his earlier work. It's a shame, because his lyricism is still unmatched. Perhaps, like many of us, Eminem's been trying to evolve and experiment with his sound. Still, it's hard not to miss the old Eminem - the one who made rap anthems that resonated with a generation.
