**The Emergency Fund I Didn’t Build (Yet)**

Okay, real talk. I just finished writing a post last year about building an emergency fund – all shiny spreadsheets and encouraging words. Looking back at 2022, though, it feels… a little tone-deaf. Life threw a curveball, a *big* one, and suddenly “rainy day” felt more like a monsoon. 

It was a stark reminder that budgeting is great, but it doesn’t account for the truly unexpected. The stress of navigating that financial hardship honestly took me completely out of my routine.  I’m still working on rebuilding, and I wanted to be honest about the fact that sometimes, our best-laid plans need a serious rethink.  Anyone else relate?

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post focused on a slightly different angle?
