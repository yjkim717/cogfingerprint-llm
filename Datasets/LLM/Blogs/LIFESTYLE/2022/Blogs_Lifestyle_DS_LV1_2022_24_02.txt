It’s 2022, and I’ve been thinking a lot about authenticity lately—especially when it comes to food. I love seeing vegan recipes pop up everywhere, but something feels off when celebrity chefs who built their fame on sizzling steaks suddenly champion tofu. It’s great they’re spreading the word, but where’s the consistency? And honestly, many of the "innovative" meat substitutes they showcase have been perfected by small vegan creators for years. It’s disheartening to see others take credit. For me, living a mindful lifestyle means aligning actions with values. If we’re going to promote change, let’s do it with sincerity, not just when the cameras are rolling.
