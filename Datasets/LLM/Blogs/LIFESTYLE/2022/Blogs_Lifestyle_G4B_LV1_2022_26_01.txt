**The Ghost in the Machine (and My Zephyrus G14)**

Late 2022 felt like a year of chasing efficiency, right? I was finally getting the hang of remote work, but my new Zephyrus G14 laptop was fighting me every step of the way. I loved the sleek design, but I’d been fiddling with the “silent mode” feature, trying to keep things quiet during Zoom calls. 

Suddenly, it started overheating – seriously hot.  Then the fans went into overdrive, a constant, frantic whir. I tried everything: different software, adjusting settings… nothing worked. It felt like a glitch, a little digital ghost haunting my productivity.  It was a frustrating reminder that sometimes, even the newest tech needs a little respect and a bit of understanding.
