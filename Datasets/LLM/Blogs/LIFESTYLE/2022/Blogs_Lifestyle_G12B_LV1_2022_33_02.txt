## The Apartment Hunt and the Weight of 700

Okay, let's be real. Apartment hunting in New York City in 2022 felt less like finding a home and more like passing a financial exam I wasn’t entirely prepared for. I'd heard horror stories, of course, but nothing really prepared me for the sheer *pressure*.

The biggest hurdle? The credit score. Suddenly, my perfectly reasonable (if sometimes overspent) twenties were being judged by a three-digit number. Landlords seemed to have this unspoken rule: 700 or bust.

It’s frustrating, isn't it? Like, I’m a responsible person! I pay my bills, I work hard, but I also occasionally treat myself to a nice dinner or a weekend getaway. Does that automatically disqualify me from a decent apartment? It felt incredibly arbitrary.

I spent weeks stressing, pulling my credit report, and trying to understand how these things *really* worked. It felt like another layer of systemic inequality, pushing out younger generations and those who haven’t had the luxury of building perfect credit from the get-go.

Honestly, it sparked a bigger conversation for me. We need to talk more about financial literacy, especially for young adults. Understanding credit, budgeting, and navigating the complexities of renting shouldn't be a guessing game. I’m hoping, maybe, this whole experience can be a catalyst for real housing reform, a move away from these rigid requirements and towards a more equitable system.
