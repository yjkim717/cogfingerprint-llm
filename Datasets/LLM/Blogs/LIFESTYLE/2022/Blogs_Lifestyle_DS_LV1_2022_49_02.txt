### Finding Humanity in the Headlines

It’s 2022, and my morning scroll through the news often leaves me with a heavy heart. The endless debate about refugees feels less about people and more about political point-scoring. I read how some claim the entire crisis was engineered for votes, and it makes me want to disconnect entirely.

But then I think about my neighbour, Ahmet, who quietly helps a Syrian family at the local market. No cameras, no politics—just simple human kindness. That’s the "akl-i selim," the common sense, we’re missing.

This isn’t just a political issue; it’s a lifestyle one. Choosing empathy over anger in our daily interactions is a small act of rebellion. My resolution? To focus less on the divisive headlines and more on the helpers, the bridge-builders. That’s the Turkey I want to live in.
