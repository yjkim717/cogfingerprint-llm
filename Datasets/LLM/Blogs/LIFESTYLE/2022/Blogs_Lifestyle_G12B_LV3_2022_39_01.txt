>## Equitable Access: A Textbook Quandary (and a Slightly Confusing Response Session?)

Okay, so finals are looming, and the textbook situation is *always* a stressor, right? This year, UCDavis is pushing Equitable Access for a bunch of my classes – PLS 21 and ECN 1a included. It’s tempting! The idea of not shelling out a fortune upfront is seriously appealing, especially with everything else going on in 2022. 

But is it *really* worth it? I'm trying to crunch the numbers, thinking about how much I’ll actually use each textbook. And then there's ECN 1a... what *is* a "response session" exactly? Anyone else navigating this Equitable Access thing? Send help (and explanations!)!
