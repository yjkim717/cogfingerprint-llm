**Finding My Rhythm, Not Just Speed**

It was late 2022, and I was obsessed with tuning my expedition teams in Epic Seven. I’d spend hours tweaking stats for that perfect "speed tune," letting them run on auto-battle while I did other things. The goal was simple: maximize damage for better rewards. When a "whale" teammate would drop a flashy emote after a huge damage number, I’d feel a pang of frustration. My output just wasn't there.

Then, during one lazy Saturday session, it hit me. I was treating my own life like an auto-battle—just going through the motions, chasing efficiency, and comparing my "damage" to everyone else’s highlight reels. I was so focused on the end reward, I’d forgotten to enjoy the strategy, the small wins, and the simple fun of the game.

I’ve started applying that lesson offline. Life isn’t about the perfect, automated tune for maximum output. It’s about being present in the messy, manual, and wonderfully imperfect moments. The rewards are so much better this way.
