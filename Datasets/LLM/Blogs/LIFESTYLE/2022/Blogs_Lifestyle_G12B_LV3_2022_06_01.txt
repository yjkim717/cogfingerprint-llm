## That Unexpected In-Flight Charge… Anyone Else?

Okay, so this happened to me recently on JetBlue. I enjoyed a couple of drinks on separate flights (don't judge!), and when my credit card statement arrived, things were a little…confusing. Apparently, there’s some debate about whether those in-flight alcohol purchases automatically hit the card linked to your seat. It got me thinking – how many of us have experienced unexpected travel charges? It’s a little reminder to double-check those bills, right? 2022 has been full of surprises!
