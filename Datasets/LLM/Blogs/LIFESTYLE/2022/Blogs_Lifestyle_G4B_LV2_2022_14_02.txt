**The Tightrope Walk: Running, Travel, and Feeling Like I’m Losing Myself**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt… intense. Not just in the usual, chaotic-adult-way, but in a specifically *running*-related way. I've been pouring my heart and soul into marathon training – a ridiculously ambitious goal – and simultaneously, my job decided to throw me a series of work trips that felt designed to test my sanity. 

I’m an ultrarunner, you see. I love the solitude, the challenge, the feeling of pushing my body to its absolute limit. But then I’d be jetting off to a different city every couple of weeks, spending 14 hours a day in meetings, and feeling like I was actively *forgetting* how to breathe deeply, let alone lace up my shoes.

I started questioning everything. Was I sacrificing too much? Was I permanently pausing my training, or just delaying the inevitable? The thought of stepping away from the trails felt like admitting defeat, but the thought of continuing at this pace felt… unsustainable. 

There were days I'd stare at my meticulously planned training schedule and feel a wave of guilt, knowing I was missing crucial mileage. It’s a weird balancing act, isn’t it? Trying to hold onto the things that make you feel alive while navigating the demands of a life that isn't always designed for peak performance. 

Honestly, it’s a work in progress. I’m still figuring out how to weave these different parts of my life together – and maybe, just maybe, accepting that "perfect" doesn’t exist.
