## The Tiny Steps That Moved My Mountains (and Why 2022 Was About Them)

Okay, let's be honest. 2022 felt… heavy. I think for a lot of us, it did. The pandemic hangover lingered, inflation was hitting hard, and the general feeling of uncertainty just seemed to cling to everything. I found myself, more than once, staring at my to-do list – a sprawling, intimidating beast – and feeling utterly paralyzed. The weight of *everything* I wanted to accomplish felt crushing.

Sound familiar?

For years, I’d been trapped in a cycle of grand plans and spectacular failures. I’d set these huge, ambitious goals – learn a new language, write a novel, finally get into decent shape – and then, inevitably, get overwhelmed by the sheer scale of it all. I’d tell myself I’d start “next week,” “next month,” “when I had more time.” You know the drill. Procrastination, disguised as sensible planning.

But something shifted in me this year. It wasn't a sudden epiphany, more like a slow, gradual realization. I was spending so much energy *thinking* about doing things, that I wasn't actually *doing* them. I was building elaborate castles in the air, and then wondering why they kept collapsing.

I stumbled across this idea – the "1% improvement" concept – and it genuinely resonated. The idea that you don’t need to overhaul your entire life overnight, you just need to get a little bit better, a little bit closer, *every single day*. It sounds almost ridiculously simple, doesn't it?

So, I started small. Really small. Instead of aiming to write a chapter of my novel, I committed to writing just one paragraph. Instead of a full hour at the gym, it was 15 minutes of stretching. Instead of diving into Duolingo for 30 minutes, I just did one lesson.

The amazing thing? Those tiny actions started to compound. That one paragraph led to another. Those 15 minutes of stretching turned into a longer workout. That single Duolingo lesson sparked a desire to learn more.

It wasn’t about dramatic transformations. It was about consistent effort. It was about showing up, even when I didn’t feel like it. It was about celebrating those tiny victories, those incremental steps forward.

And you know what? It worked. I didn't finish my novel (yet!), but I have a solid draft. I'm feeling stronger and more energetic. And my basic French is actually starting to make sense!

More importantly, I realized that the biggest obstacle wasn't a lack of time or resources, it was my own mindset. It was the belief that I needed to be perfect, that I needed to have everything figured out before I could even begin.

2022 taught me that progress isn't about giant leaps, it's about tiny steps. It's about finding that "next possible action" - that
