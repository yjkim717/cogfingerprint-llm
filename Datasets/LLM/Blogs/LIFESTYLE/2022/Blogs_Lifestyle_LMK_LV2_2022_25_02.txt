As I sipped my morning coffee in 2022, I stumbled upon a heated debate about Luffy's abilities in the One Piece series. A fan was puzzled - how did Luffy hit Enel in the Skypeia arc if he's not actually made of rubber? It got me thinking, our perceptions can be turned upside down by new information. Just like Luffy's 'rubber' powers, being open to changing our views can be a liberating experience, allowing us to grow and adapt in life.
