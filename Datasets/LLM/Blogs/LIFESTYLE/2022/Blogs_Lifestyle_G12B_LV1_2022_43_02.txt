## Drowning in Spreadsheets, Finding My Way Back to "Simple"

It's 2022, and I feel like I've been living inside a giant CSV file lately. Seriously. Work’s been a data deluge – tracking everything, analyzing it, trying to extract *something* useful.  And the sheer volume? Overwhelming. I’ve been staring at endless rows and columns, wishing there was a simple way to just… filter things. To find the *specific* thing I was looking for without sifting through mountains of information.

It got me thinking about life outside of work, too. How often do we let ourselves get bogged down in the noise?  All the things, all the choices, the constant stream of information. I realized I needed a "faceted search" for my own life – a way to filter out the distractions and focus on what truly matters.  Less scrolling, more intentionality.  

Maybe it's as simple as saying "no" more often, or dedicating specific time slots to hobbies.  Finding my own open-source solution to the chaos, one small filter at a time. It’s a work in progress, but I’m hoping to download a little more peace of mind.
