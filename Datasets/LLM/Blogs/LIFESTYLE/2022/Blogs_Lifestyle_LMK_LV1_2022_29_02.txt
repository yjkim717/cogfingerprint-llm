Living with bipolar disorder can be a lonely ride. I've struggled to open up to friends about my mood swings, fearing judgment or misunderstanding. But having one friend who's experienced anxiety has made all the difference. They get it. They don't try to fix me or offer unsolicited advice. In 2022, I'm learning to be kinder to myself and rely on my support system, including medication. It's okay to not be okay, and having someone who understands is a game-changer. I've found solace in our conversations, and it's helped me navigate the ups and downs.
