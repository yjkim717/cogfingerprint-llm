It’s funny how a warped 3D printer bed can make you reflect on life. Back in 2022, my Fystec sheet started lifting at the corners, ruining prints. I’d assumed it was permanent, like some habits or beliefs. But then I discovered the whole world of magnetic, textured PEI spring steel beds. It was a reminder that sometimes, what feels like a foundational flaw isn't a life sentence—it’s just a sign you need a better base to build on. A simple upgrade changed everything.
