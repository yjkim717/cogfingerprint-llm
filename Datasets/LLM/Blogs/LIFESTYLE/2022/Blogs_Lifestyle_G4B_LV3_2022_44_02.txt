**The Price of a Cleaner Street**

It’s funny how we get so hung up on the *how* of things, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about Compound V – not the sci-fi kind, but the unsettling idea of prioritizing order above all else. The author’s argument about eliminating “villains” for the greater good really stuck with me, and it made me consider the compromises we make every day, often without realizing it. 

Think about it: that butcher down the street, maybe a little gruff, but always honest about his meat. Or Hugie, the guy who always seems to be struggling, but always offers a kind word. Are we, as a society, willing to sacrifice those imperfect, messy human connections for a superficially cleaner world? 

It feels like a slippery slope.  The desire for power – to control, to eliminate – can easily lead to a moral compromise, a quiet acceptance of something fundamentally wrong.  2022 has felt like a year of heightened anxieties, and it’s easy to crave simple solutions. But true progress, I suspect, always comes with a cost, and we need to be incredibly vigilant about what we’re truly willing to pay.
