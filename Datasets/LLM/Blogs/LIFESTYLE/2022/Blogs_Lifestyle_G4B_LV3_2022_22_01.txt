**That *Data* Episode… and the Feeling of Being a Simulation**

Okay, I’ve been wrestling with something lately, and it oddly brought to mind a classic *Star Trek* episode. You know the one – the one where Data’s… well, let’s just say he’s questioning his own reality. It got me thinking: are we, as humans, often just incredibly sophisticated simulations ourselves? 

It’s a weird thought, I know. But the more I consider it, the more I see echoes of Data’s internal struggle in our own lives. We chase goals, solve problems, and build relationships – it feels like a series of puzzles, right? But what if there’s a deeper, more unsettling mystery at play? 

2022 felt like a year of constant shifts, of feeling like I was navigating a complex, ever-changing program. Like Data, I was trying to understand my own code, my own purpose. Maybe the real point isn’t *solving* the puzzle, but simply experiencing the questions.  It’s a pretty hefty thing to unpack, isn’t it?
