**Pixels & Panic: Trying to Capture the Crypto Chaos**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of chasing fleeting things. Shiny crypto coins, viral trends, even just a decent night’s sleep! I found myself getting sucked into the endless scroll, trying to predict the next big move. It led me down a weird rabbit hole – I started tinkering with a Discord bot, attempting to build a little system to track candlestick charts of cryptocurrency. 

The goal? To create a visual representation, a way to *see* the volatility.  I even got ambitious and started researching Python APIs for image generation, desperately wanting to turn data into something more engaging. It’s a fascinating, slightly frantic process, and a reminder that sometimes, the best way to understand something complex is to try and build it yourself.  A little pixelated chaos, perhaps?
