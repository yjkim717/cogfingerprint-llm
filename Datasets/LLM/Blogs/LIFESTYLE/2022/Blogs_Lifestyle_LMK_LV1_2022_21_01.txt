"As a movie buff, I've always wondered: do AMC theatre employees get to sneak a peek at new releases before they hit the big screen? Or do they have to wait until their day off like the rest of us? I imagine it's a perk to be among the first to see the latest blockbuster. But do they get to enjoy it on their own time, or is it a work thing? Either way, I reckon it's a pretty sweet benefit of working at AMC in 2022."
