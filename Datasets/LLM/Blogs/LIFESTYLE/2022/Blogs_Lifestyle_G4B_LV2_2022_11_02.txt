**The Weight of a Backup**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something so seemingly practical – backing up your data – can feel so… weighty?  Last year, I was wrestling with the same question as that Debian NAS user: how to truly *secure* everything. I finally decided to move my root directory to an encrypted external drive.
