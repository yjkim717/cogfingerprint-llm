In 2022, I learned that just as a misstep in assembly language can cause a segmentation fault, our own missteps can lead to setbacks. But it's how we handle the exit - or rather, the detour - that matters. By reflecting on my coding struggles, I gained a new appreciation for the importance of patience and persistence in both programming and life."
