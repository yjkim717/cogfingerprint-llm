It’s Talent Tuesday again, and scrolling through our sobernauts’ posts, I’m struck by how much has changed since I got sober. A year ago, my only "talent" was finding the bottom of a bottle. Now, I’m lacing up my climbing shoes, feeling the rough texture of the rock under my fingers. Every grip is a small victory, a sober accomplishment that builds my confidence. This community, with its simple promise of "I Will Not Drink, But I Will Climb Something With You Today," reminds me that we’re not just giving something up—we’re rediscovering ourselves. Sobriety isn’t an empty space; it’s where our real talents finally get room to breathe and grow.
