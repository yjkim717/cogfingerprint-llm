As I sat in my 2012 Chevy Impala, stuck in traffic on the 405 in 2022, I couldn't help but think about the countless times it had let me down. The random power loss, the stalling on the highway, the rough idle that made me wonder if I'd make it to my destination. I'd taken it to multiple mechanics, each with their own theory, but none able to pinpoint the issue. It was like having a nagging health problem that no doctor could diagnose. I'd grown frustrated, feeling like I was losing control. But as I reflected on it, I realized that the car's issues were a metaphor for my own life. Just like the faulty electronics that were wreaking havoc on my Impala, I had my own set of problems that needed attention. It was time to take a closer look and get to the root of the problem.
