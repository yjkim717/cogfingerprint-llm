**The Waiting Game (and Why It Almost Broke Me)**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of *waiting*. Not the fun kind, like waiting for a concert, but the agonizing kind where you’re staring at a huge project and feeling utterly powerless. I was diving into a small business venture – trying to land a government contract for a specialized product – and it hit me hard. 

The initial investment was a hefty $285,000, and the government’s payment schedule? Let's just say it wasn't exactly friendly. I was relying on vendor financing, which felt like a precarious tightrope walk.  It really highlighted how much my business, built on a largely cash-based model, was vulnerable. 

There were days I felt completely stuck, the pressure mounting. It taught me a brutal lesson about patience, and the importance of having a truly solid financial plan – something I definitely need to revisit!  Anyone else feel like they were constantly waiting for something big to happen in 2022?
