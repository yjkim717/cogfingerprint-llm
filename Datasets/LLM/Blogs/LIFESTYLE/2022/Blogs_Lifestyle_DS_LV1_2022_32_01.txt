It was during that strange spring of 2022, while reorganizing my fridge for the third time, that I had a small epiphany. I pulled out a jar of homemade teriyaki sauce I’d made weeks prior and gave it a tentative sniff. To my surprise, it was still perfect. In a world that felt increasingly fleeting, here was something I’d created that had lasting power.

This discovery sent me down a rabbit hole. I started pickling red onions and perfecting a spicy jalapeño salsa, each batch a small promise of future meals. I realized I wasn't just stocking my fridge; I was building a pantry of patience. In cultivating these long-lasting creations, I found a quiet, tangible counterbalance to the relentless pace of everything else. It’s a simple pleasure, but a deeply satisfying one.
