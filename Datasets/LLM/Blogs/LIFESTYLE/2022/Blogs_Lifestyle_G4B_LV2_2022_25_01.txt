**That Gut Feeling – And Why It Matters**

Remember last year when I almost got into a fender-bender? A flashing yellow light, a distracted driver, and suddenly I was replaying every driving decision I’d ever made. It wasn’t a huge crash, thankfully, but it really got me thinking about responsibility and trusting those little whispers in your gut. 

I’d been reading about a DoorDash driver dealing with an insurance claim after a similar incident – the whole process of fault determination felt so overwhelming. It made me realize how easily we can brush aside those instincts, focusing instead on speed and getting somewhere quickly. 

Maybe it’s not just driving. Life is full of these moments where a quiet voice is trying to tell us something. Let’s slow down, listen, and trust that feeling – it could save us a whole lot of stress, and maybe even a few accidents.
