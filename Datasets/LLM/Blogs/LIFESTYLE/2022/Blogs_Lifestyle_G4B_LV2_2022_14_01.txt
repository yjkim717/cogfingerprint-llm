**The Unexpected Weight of a Plastic Card**

2022 was a year of pushing my limits – literally, with my ultrarunning. But I also found myself grappling with something unexpected: a credit card. It started innocently enough, a way to cover work purchases and, frankly, the occasional celebratory post-race treat. 

Then I realized it was actively *sabotaging* my debt repayment goals.

It made me seriously consider closing it – a tough decision, but one I knew I needed to make for my peace of mind.
