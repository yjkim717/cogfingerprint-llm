## Lost in Translation (and Loving It)

Remember that feeling of being completely, wonderfully lost? That’s pretty much defined my 2022. I finally took the plunge and did an Erasmus exchange – computer engineering, of all things! – bouncing from Belgium to Germany, with a quick Czech Republic pit stop. 

Honestly, the initial culture shock was *real*. Ordering coffee felt like cracking a code. But that discomfort? It was also the most exhilarating thing. I learned more about myself navigating those unfamiliar streets, figuring out public transport, and stumbling through conversations, than I have in years. It wasn't always easy, but the growth? Absolutely priceless. If you're even *thinking* about it, do it. Seriously. It's a messy, beautiful adventure.
