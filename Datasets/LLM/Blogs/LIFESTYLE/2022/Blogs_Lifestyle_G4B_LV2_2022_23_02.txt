**The Little Wanderer**

It’s funny how a simple post on Reddit can suddenly make you feel…aware. I saw a story last week about a lost corgi mix near the University of Florida, a little guy hoping someone would recognize him. It just hit me – how easily we get caught up in our own routines, forgetting that little moments of vulnerability exist everywhere. 

Thinking about that lost dog sparked a reminder for me.  Sometimes, life feels like a frantic dash, but pausing to notice the unexpected, like a lost dog searching for home, can be a beautiful, grounding practice.  It’s a gentle nudge to be a little more observant, a little more kind. 2022 has been a year of speed, and I’m trying to slow down a bit.

Do you want me to tweak this or perhaps write a post with a different focus?
