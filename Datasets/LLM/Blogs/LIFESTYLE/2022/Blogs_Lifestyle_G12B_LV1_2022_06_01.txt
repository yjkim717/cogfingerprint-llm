owly sipping a sparkling wine at 35,000 feet â€“ a surprisingly common occurrence this year! I recently flew JetBlue a few times and noticed something odd: no charges for the drinks I bought. Was it a perk? A glitch? Or just a very generous flight attendant? It got me thinking about those little travel moments that make you pause and appreciate the unexpected kindness, or at least, wonder about the billing system. Small joys, right?
