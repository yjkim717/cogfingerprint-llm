"Navigating the Uncharted: A Doordash Driver's Dilemma"

As a gig economy worker, I never thought I'd be caught up in a car accident while making a delivery. But, life had other plans. On a typical Tuesday afternoon in 2022, I found myself at the center of a fender bender at an intersection with a flashing yellow light. As a Doordash driver, I was left wondering - who's liable? The insurance company's questions swirled in my head: "Were you speeding?", "Did you yield to oncoming traffic?" The flashing yellow light, meant to caution drivers, now seemed like a gray area. As I navigated the aftermath, I realized that the uncertainty wasn't just about fault - it was about the unpredictability of life. The experience taught me to be prepared for the unexpected and to stay vigilant, even in seemingly routine moments.
