It’s 2022, and I’ve been sober for over a year now. At first, I worried I’d lose my spark—that creative buzz I thought only a drink could bring. But then, I picked up my old guitar.

Slowly, I started playing again, writing songs I never had the clarity to compose before. I found a local sober community online, and we began sharing our art—poetry, paintings, music. We celebrated each small win, not with a toast, but with genuine support.

Turns out, my real talent wasn’t hiding in a bottle; it was waiting for the quiet space sobriety offered. Now, creating feels like the truest form of celebration—one that connects me to myself and others in ways I never imagined.
