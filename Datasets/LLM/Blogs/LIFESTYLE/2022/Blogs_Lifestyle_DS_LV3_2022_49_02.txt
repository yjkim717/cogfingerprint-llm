It’s 2022, and I find myself scrolling through endless headlines, each one louder than the last. Words like “mülteci” and “hükümet” swirl together with charged emotions, and it’s easy to feel swept up in the tide of anger. I’ve noticed how quickly frustration can turn into something uglier—into “nefret.” It’s a heavy word, one that leaves little room for solutions.

But I’ve been asking myself: what if, instead of feeding the noise, we channeled that energy into something clearer? Something like our right to “oy vermek”—to vote not from fear, but from hope. Because real “çözüm” begins not in chaos, but in calm, thoughtful choices. It starts with us, in our daily lives, choosing understanding over outrage. And maybe that’s the most personal change we can make.
