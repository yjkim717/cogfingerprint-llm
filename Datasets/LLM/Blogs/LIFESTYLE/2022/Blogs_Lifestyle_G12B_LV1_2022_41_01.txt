>## The Joy of the Simple Recipe

It’s funny how trends work, isn't it? Remember when everything had to be *extra*? Elaborate Instagram feeds, perfectly curated lives, and recipes with a million ingredients and techniques I could barely pronounce? 2022 feels like a turning point for me. I've been actively shedding that pressure.

Recently, I rediscovered the joy of a simple tomato pasta. Just canned tomatoes, garlic, basil, a little olive oil, and pasta. No fancy cheeses, no complicated sauces. And it was *delicious*. It made me think about all the other areas of my life where I was overcomplicating things. 

Sometimes, less really *is* more. Maybe that’s why I’m suddenly appreciating the straightforwardness of a good book, a walk in the park, or even just a quiet evening with a mug of tea.  Stripping things back, embracing the basics - it’s surprisingly liberating.
