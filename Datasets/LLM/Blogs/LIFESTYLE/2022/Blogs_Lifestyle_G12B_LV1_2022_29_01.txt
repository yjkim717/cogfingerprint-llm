## Saying "Yes" to Small & Saying "Yes" to Adventure

It’s funny how life throws curveballs, isn’t it? For years, I envisioned a grand wedding – a huge ballroom, a sprawling guest list, the whole shebang. But then, 2022 happened. The world felt… different. Priorities shifted. And somewhere along the way, I realized a massive, formal affair just didn't feel authentic to who we are as a couple.

So, we're doing something completely different. We’re planning an intimate wedding, right in our backyard. It's still incredibly exciting, of course, but the joy comes from the cozy, personal feel of it all. Close friends, family, fairy lights, and just… genuine connection.

It’s also led to some unexpected decisions. Like, instead of a traditional wedding photographer, we're exploring a really unique option. My fiancé, bless his adventurous soul, suggested we book a photographer for an engagement shoot in Indonesia! We've both been dreaming of visiting, and combining it with capturing these memories feels utterly perfect. 

Of course, the budget is a big consideration. Wedding costs, even for a smaller affair, add up fast. But prioritizing experiences – like that trip and the photographer who can capture it – feels more important than elaborate decorations or a lavish venue. It’s about creating memories that last a lifetime, and honestly, I think this path feels a lot more *us*. It’s a reminder that sometimes, saying “yes” to small and saying “yes” to adventure is the most beautiful thing you can do.
