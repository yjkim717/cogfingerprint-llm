## The Art of the Ask (and the Limits of Patience)

It's officially the post-Fourth of July slump. The fireworks are packed away, the grills are cooling down, and I’m finally catching my breath. This weekend was… something. I work in the meat department of a grocery store, and let me tell you, holiday weekends are a whole other level of chaos.

Normally, I love helping people find the perfect cut. But this year, it felt like everyone suddenly became a steak artisan. "Can you slice this sirloin *just so*?" "A butterfly cut, but a little thicker?" "Can you trim *all* the fat?" I get it, wanting the perfect cookout. Really, I do. But the sheer volume, combined with the already frantic pace… it tested my patience.

It made me think about expectations, though. We all have them, right? And sometimes, we forget that behind the counter, behind the display case, there’s a person trying their best. A person who just wants to get everyone their steak, and maybe, just maybe, make it home at a reasonable hour. 2022 has been a year of perspective shifts for me, and this weekend was a small, meaty reminder of that.
