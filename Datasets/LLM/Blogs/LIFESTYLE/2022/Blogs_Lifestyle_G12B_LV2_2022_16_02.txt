>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a relatable and reflective tone, and set in 2022.  I've focused on the feeling of wanting to stick to a plan while life throws curveballs, echoing the frustration in the original summary but translated to a lifestyle context.  I've also included a couple of options for titles.

**Option 1 Title: The Unexpected Detour (and Why It's Okay)**

**Option 2 Title: My 2022 Resolution... and How It Changed**

Okay, so remember back in January? I was *determined* to learn pottery. Like, seriously dedicated. Pinterest boards, kiln research, the whole nine yards. It was going to be *my thing*, a calming creative outlet amidst the chaos of… well, 2022. Then life, as it often does, had other plans. A new project at work, family stuff, you know. Pottery got sidelined. 

It felt like a failure at first, abandoning that resolution. But honestly? I've found something even better – rediscovering my love for hiking. It's less structured, more spontaneous, and feels perfectly right *now*. Sometimes the best paths aren’t the ones we plan, are they?

**Explanation of Choices & How it Relates to the Prompt:**

*   **Relatable Tone:** I used conversational language ("Okay, so remember...", "you know") and shared a personal (though fictional) experience.
*   **Reflective:** The post isn't just about pottery; it's about the broader theme of adapting to change and re-evaluating goals.
*   **Storytelling:**  It has a clear narrative arc: initial enthusiasm, unexpected obstacles, and a shift in perspective.
*   **2022 Context:** The mention of "the chaos of… well, 2022" subtly nods to the year without being overly specific or heavy.
*   **Echo of Original Prompt:** The feeling of a planned scenario being disrupted (“Soviet Union vs. the world”/ Pottery) and the search for an alternative (mods/hiking) are mirrored.
*   **Word Count:** Roughly 111 words, as requested.
