**Chasing Signals in a Chaotic Year**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we get so caught up in trying to *predict* things – the market, our moods, even what the next viral trend will be. This year, 2022 felt particularly… chaotic. Every day brought a new wave of uncertainty, and I found myself obsessing over data, searching for patterns. 

It started with a small project: building a Discord bot to track crypto prices. Not for profit, really, but just to wrestle some control over the noise. I was using a Python API, trying to visualize everything with candlestick charts – basically, turning data into something a little less overwhelming. 

There’s something strangely meditative about coding, about building something tangible from abstract information. It’s a way of imposing order on a world that often feels completely random.  Maybe that’s why I was drawn to it this year.  A little digital signal in the storm. 

What's one way you’ve tried to find a sense of control lately?
