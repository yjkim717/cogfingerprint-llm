**Sorting Through the Chaos (and My Inbox)**

2022 felt… overwhelming, honestly. My inbox was a monstrous CSV file – a jumble of commitments, to-dos, and half-formed ideas. I realized I needed a better way to *find* what mattered, not just process everything. It’s like trying to do faceted search on a spreadsheet of life! 

I started building simple systems – prioritizing tasks, delegating where I could, and ruthlessly cutting out the noise.  It’s not about becoming a super-efficient robot, but about creating a UI for my own life, where I can quickly filter out the distractions and focus on what truly brings me joy.  Small steps, really, but they’ve made a huge difference.
