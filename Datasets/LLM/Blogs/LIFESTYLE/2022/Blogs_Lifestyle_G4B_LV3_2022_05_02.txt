**When the World Just… Stutters**

Remember that feeling? That frustrating little hitch in the flow of something you *really* wanted to enjoy? Lately, I’ve been battling a weird stutter in my gaming – specifically, Elden Ring on my PS5. It’s not the game itself, beautiful and brutal as it is, but the connection between the controller and the system. 

It seems motion sensing is the culprit, causing these jarring freezes and lag spikes. It’s maddening when you’re lost in a fight, and suddenly the world just… stutters. It’s a surprisingly poignant reminder that sometimes, even the most advanced technology can let us down. It’s a frustrating glitch, but also a little unsettling – a tiny crack in the illusion of seamless immersion.  Anyone else experiencing this digital frustration in 2022?
