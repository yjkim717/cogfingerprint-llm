### The Holodeck in My Pocket: What My Phone is Teaching Me About Being Present

I’ve been on a bit of a retro sci-fi kick lately, rewatching old *Star Trek* episodes. The other night, I stumbled upon one where the android, Data, gets wrapped up in a holodeck mystery. For those who don’t know, the holodeck is this perfect virtual reality room—it can create any world, any person, any experience, all indistinguishable from reality. The episode was a clever whodunit, but it got me thinking less about artificial intelligence and more about my own.

It hit me: I’m carrying a holodeck in my pocket.

Think about it. My phone can instantly transport me. A scroll through Instagram and I’m at a friend’s wedding in Italy. A tap on TikTok and I’m learning a dance routine in a vibrant, sunlit studio. A news alert pulls me into a tense political debate happening a thousand miles away. It’s all there, a curated, on-demand reality, just like Data’s holodeck adventures.

But here’s the 2022 rub, the mystery I’m now trying to solve in my own life. In that *Star Trek* episode, the central question was about what makes something truly *alive* and sentient. And I’ve started to wonder: in my constant dipping in and out of these digital worlds, am I becoming less sentient to my own?

I noticed it last week. I was at the park, the sun was warm on my skin, and my son was trying to master the monkey bars with intense, adorable concentration. And what was I doing? I was filming it, my face bathed in the cool blue light of the screen, watching the moment through a lens instead of living it. I was present in the holodeck version of the moment, but almost entirely absent from the real one.

The mystery isn't about the sentience of my phone; it’s about protecting my own. My phone isn’t evil—it’s an incredible tool. But like any powerful technology, it requires intention. The real adventure, I’m learning, isn’t in the endless escapism it offers. It’s in having the courage to sometimes put the holodeck away.

To feel the sun without filtering it. To listen to my son’s laughter without wondering if it’s record-worthy. To be a sentient, feeling human, fully immersed in the beautifully un-curated, sometimes messy, but always real world right in front of me. That’s a life worth logging off for.
