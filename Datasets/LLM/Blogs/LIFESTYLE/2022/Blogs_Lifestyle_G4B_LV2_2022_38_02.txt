**The Weight of a Dream (and a One-Way Ticket)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple question – “What’s next?” – can suddenly feel like carrying the weight of the world. That’s exactly where I was last year, staring at a laptop screen and wrestling with the idea of chasing a higher education degree while also seriously considering an international move. 

I’m a software engineer, and the pull of a completely new landscape, a fresh start, and the potential for a scholarship felt incredibly strong.  It’s a daunting thought – uprooting your life, navigating a new culture, and investing in your future.  

Honestly, there were days I felt completely overwhelmed. But the desire for that kind of growth, that leap of faith, kept me going.  It’s a feeling I suspect many young professionals grapple with – the beautiful, terrifying weight of a dream.
