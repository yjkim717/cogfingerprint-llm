It’s funny how a mobile game can mirror life, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been obsessed with optimizing my expedition teams—tweaking the team composition, chasing that perfect auto-battle strategy to maximize damage. In 2022, it felt like we were all just trying to automate our way to better results, both on and off the screen.

I’d stare at my phone, watching the damage numbers fluctuate, never quite hitting that sweet spot consistently. It wasn’t just about my own rewards; I wanted to be a reliable support for my friends’ lists, too. That’s the thing about community—even in a game, your performance ripples outward. It got me thinking: where else in my life was I on autopilot, just hoping for the best instead of building a strategy for a win? Maybe it was time to re-examine my own daily “team composition.”
