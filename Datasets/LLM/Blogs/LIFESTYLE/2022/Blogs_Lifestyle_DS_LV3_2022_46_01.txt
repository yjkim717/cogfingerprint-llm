It was supposed to be my 2022 game-changer: that smooth, textured PEI sheet from Fystec, promising perfect first layers. I’d carefully attach the magnetic base to my 355x355mm spring steel bed, dreaming of flawless prints. But over months, a subtle warp appeared, a persistent low spot mocking my efforts. It became a frustrating metaphor—how even the most promising setups can develop flaws over time. The quest for a reliable replacement isn’t just about hardware; it’s about rebuilding that initial hope for a perfect, effortless creation.
