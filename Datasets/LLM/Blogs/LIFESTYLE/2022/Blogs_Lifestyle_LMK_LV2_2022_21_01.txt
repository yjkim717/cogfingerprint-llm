"Behind the Silver Screen: My AMC Experience" 
Working at AMC Theatres in 2022 was a dream come true for movie buffs like me. But, I soon realized that seeing new releases on opening night wasn't always a perk. In fact, it was often the opposite. With sold-out shows and chaotic opening nights, I'd sometimes go home without catching the film I was working on. It was a trade-off I learned to appreciate, as I got to be part of the magic that brought movies to life.
