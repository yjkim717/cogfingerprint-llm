**The Steak Saga of July 4th**

Okay, so 2022 was… a year. And the Fourth of July? Let’s just say my shift at the butcher shop was a masterclass in politely saying “no.” We were slammed, obviously – everyone wants a perfectly marbled ribeye, sliced a *very* specific way. 

It started with one request, then another, and another. “Can you do a reverse sear with a rosemary crust?” “Just a centimeter-thick filet, please!” Honestly, it felt like a special order factory exploded.  I get it, people want to impress, but when the line’s wrapped around the store and you’re already running on fumes, it’s tough. 

It made me think about how much we sometimes crave control, even over something as simple as a steak.  Maybe a little less perfection and a little more appreciation for the amazing cuts we *do* have would be a good thing, right?
