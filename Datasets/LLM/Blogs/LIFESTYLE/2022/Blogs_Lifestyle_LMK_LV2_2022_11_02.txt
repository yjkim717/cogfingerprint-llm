As I reflect on my digital life in 2022, I realize that security is just as important as any other aspect of my lifestyle. Just like locking my doors at night, I want my home server to be secure too. I recently moved my Debian NAS's /root directory to an encrypted disk, a decision that brought me peace of mind. It's amazing how a simple tweak can make a huge difference. Now, I can focus on more pressing things... like what's for dinner. Prioritizing digital security has become a new habit, and I'm feeling more in control.
