That first swipe of my new AmEx card felt like a milestone—until the reality of 2022’s slow reimbursements at work set in. Now, it sits in my wallet, a shiny reminder of a financial tightrope I didn’t mean to walk. Closing it immediately could hurt my credit, but keeping it tempts me toward debt I can’t afford. It’s a tough lesson in balancing ambition with actual means, a quiet stress many of us carry while trying to build the lives we envision.
