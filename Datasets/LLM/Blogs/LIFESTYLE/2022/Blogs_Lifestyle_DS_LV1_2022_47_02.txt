### The One Thing That Finally Made Me Feel Less Busy and More Alive

I used to wear my busyness like a badge of honor.

My to-do list was a sprawling, chaotic masterpiece. It had everything from “finalize Q3 report” and “brainstorm marketing campaign” to “water plants” and “learn how to make sourdough.” (It was 2022, after all—some pandemic habits die hard). I was a master of ticking boxes, a virtuoso of minor completions. At the end of each day, I was exhausted, but when I looked back, I couldn’t point to a single thing that had truly moved the needle. My craft—my writing—was languishing in the “when I have time” section of my life, which, it turned out, was never.

The breaking point came on a Tuesday. I had spent the entire day answering emails, attending back-to-back Zoom calls about future calls, and organizing my digital files. I felt productive. Then, I opened the document for my novel. The cursor blinked at me mockingly from the same paragraph it had been in for three days. I had all the symptoms of being busy, but none of the satisfaction of being productive.

That’s when I remembered the Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule. It’s the idea that 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. I’d heard it a million times in business articles, but I’d never applied it to my actual life. So, I decided to conduct an experiment.

For one week, I ruthlessly audited my time. I made two lists. The first was everything I did in a day. The second was a brutally honest assessment of which activities actually contributed to my core goals: becoming a better writer and feeling more creatively fulfilled.

The results were embarrassing. About 80% of my frantic activity—the endless email ping-pong, the social media scrolling disguised as “market research,” the minor household chores I used as procrastination tools—was contributing almost nothing to my sense of progress. The real magic, the stuff that made me feel alive and in flow, was that other 20%: the two hours of focused, phone-off writing first thing in the morning.

So, I flipped my life upside down. I now guard that morning block like a dragon guards its gold. Emails can wait. Meetings can be scheduled later. The world does not end if my kitchen counters aren’t spotless by 9 AM.

The shift wasn’t just about productivity; it was about peace. By focusing on the main thing—the one craft that gives my work meaning—the noise of everything else just faded into the background. I’m “doing” less, but I’m *accomplishing* more of what matters. And that sourdough starter? I finally accepted it wasn't part of my 20% and bought a lovely loaf from the bakery instead. Some victories are in knowing what to let go.
