"As I look back on my three-year house hunting journey, I'm reminded that finding 'the one' is a marathon, not a sprint. In 2022, I had the chance to work with a dedicated buyer's agent who stuck by me through it all. It got me thinking - how long should a buyer's agent commit to a client? Is it a six-month or three-year journey? For me, having an agent who understood my needs and was willing to put in the time made all the difference. It was a game-changer in my home buying experience."
