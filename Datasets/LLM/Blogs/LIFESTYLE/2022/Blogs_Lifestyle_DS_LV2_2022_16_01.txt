That frantic search for the perfect Erasmus destination back in 2022 feels like a lifetime ago. I was so focused on finding an affordable, English-friendly university with a light course load. I craved that perfect blend of academic ease and real-life adventure. Looking back, the best lessons weren't on any syllabus. They were in the messy, beautiful chaos of navigating a new city, forging friendships across cultures, and discovering a version of myself I never knew was there. The coursework was manageable, but the life lessons were the real challenge.
