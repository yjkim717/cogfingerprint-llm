>## The Final Stretch & a Whole Lotta Hustle

Okay, so here's the deal. It's Fall 2022, and I'm staring down the barrel of my last semester at UF. Exciting, right? Absolutely! But also… intense. I’m juggling EEL3872 (electrical circuits - ugh!), ALS3200C (signals and systems - equally terrifying), and *two* part-time jobs to actually, you know, pay for all this. 

It’s a constant balancing act. Some days I feel like I'm crushing it, other days I’m fueled solely by caffeine and the promise of graduation. Honestly, I’m just trying to survive these full-time course requirements while keeping my head above water. Send help (and maybe a tutor for those circuits!). Anyone else feeling the end-of-semester crunch?
