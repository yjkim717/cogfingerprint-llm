**The Ghost in the Engine – And the Ghosts in My Own Head**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple car can suddenly become a mirror reflecting all your anxieties. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a persistent little problem with my old Honda – random power loss, a disconcerting rough idle. It’s driving me absolutely crazy, and honestly, it feels a lot like the mechanics are chasing ghosts. 

They’ve run diagnostics, checked everything, but it’s just…there. Like a glitch in the system. It’s made me think about how often *I* feel like that in my own life. Little moments of sudden disruption, a rough patch in a project, a feeling of being completely disconnected. 

This car trouble has forced me to slow down, to really examine what’s going on beneath the surface. Maybe it’s the same as the mechanic's effort – a need for a clear diagnosis, not just a quick fix.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest struggles aren’t always visible, and they require patience to unravel.
