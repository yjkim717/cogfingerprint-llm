**The Quiet Struggle of Long-Distance Calls**

It’s 2022, and honestly, life feels… packed. Between work, the kids, and just trying to keep the house from collapsing, carving out quality time feels like a Herculean task. And that’s been hitting me hard with my long-distance relationship. 

Phone calls with Liam used to be these little pockets of connection. Now, they’re often punctuated by the sound of Lego explosions or a frantic “Mom, where’s my shoe?” It’s making me feel a little disconnected, even when we’re talking. 

I’m trying to be more intentional – scheduling a specific 15 minutes, putting the phone down, *really* listening. It’s a small thing, but it’s a start to making those calls feel less like a rushed obligation and more like a genuine connection.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
