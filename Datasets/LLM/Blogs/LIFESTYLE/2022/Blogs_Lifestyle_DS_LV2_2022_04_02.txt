### The Garage Door and the Ghost in the Machine

It’s 2022, and my garage door has developed a personality. Not a charming, quirky one, but a fickle, indecisive one that’s starting to feel a little too familiar.

It all started after we had that beautiful epoxy floor poured. A sleek, modern upgrade that made the space feel new. But soon after, the old chain-drive opener began acting up. It would descend smoothly, then jerk back up a foot from the ground as if it had seen a ghost. We’d reset the force thresholds, watch the little green light blink in confirmation, and for a day, all was well. Then, the sporadic behavior would return.

My husband, the pragmatist, started talking about track replacement and torque settings. But as I stood there, watching the door hesitate, I saw something else. I saw a metaphor.

Isn't this just like us? We go through a big life upgrade—a new job, a move, a personal breakthrough—and we pour a shiny new foundation for ourselves. We adjust our settings, tell ourselves we’ve fixed the old glitches. But then, the ghosts of past bumps and bruises, the subtle dings in our own tracks, resurface. We hesitate right at the threshold of something new, spooked by an invisible memory, a force we can’t quite calibrate.

I’ve done it myself. I’ll set an intention, feel the green light of motivation blink brightly within me, only to retreat at the last second. The chain of habit pulls me back, the memory of past stumbles making me flinch.

The door isn’t broken; it’s just sensitive. It’s reacting to the tiny, cumulative changes it can’t articulate. And maybe that’s the real work—not just a brute-force reset, but a gentle, patient investigation. To listen to the hesitation, to understand the history written in the tracks, and to make the adjustments with more compassion than frustration.

I’m still waiting for the repair guy. But in the meantime, I’m trying to be a little kinder to both the garage door and the ghost in my own machine. After all, we’re both just trying to navigate the tracks we’re on, one hesitant, hopeful cycle at a time.
