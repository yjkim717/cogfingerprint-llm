## The Sticky Situation & Letting Go of Control (A Little Bit)

Okay, folks, let's be real. Parenting is *hard*. Like, profoundly, unexpectedly hard. I’m sitting here, slightly bleary-eyed at 10 pm, the remnants of a battle strewn across my living room – rogue toys, a half-finished puzzle, and the lingering scent of bubble gum.

Why bubble gum? Because my seven-month-old, bless her tiny warrior spirit, waged a full-blown war against her antibiotics today. A nasty ear infection, a prescription, and a whole lot of parental desperation later, I found myself trying to force-feed a baby a bright pink, bubble gum-flavored medicine she absolutely *loathed*. 

It was…rough. I felt like a villain. All the gentle encouragement, the silly faces, the attempts at distraction – all failed. I was clinging to this idea of being a "good" parent, which apparently meant getting the medicine down at *any* cost. 

Then, my husband gently pointed out, "She’s a baby. She’s allowed to dislike things."

And he was right. 

It was a moment of letting go. A tiny shift in perspective. I realized I was so focused on *control* – on doing everything "right" – that I was missing the point. This wasn't about me; it was about her. 

We ended up giving a smaller dose, a little less aggressively. And honestly? It felt better for *everyone*.  It’s a small thing, a sticky medication situation, but it’s been a reminder that sometimes, the best thing you can do is breathe, reassess, and let go of the need to be perfect. 2022 has been a year of learning that lesson in so many ways, and this definitely ranks up there.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
