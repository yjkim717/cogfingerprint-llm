That frantic night in early 2022 is etched in my memory. My Erasmus application deadline loomed, and I was paralyzed by choice. As a computer engineering student from Spain, my budget was tight, and my English wasâ€¦ functional. Did I chase prestige or peace? I finally chose a smaller, affordable city known for its welcoming tech scene. It wasn't the flashiest option, but it promised a manageable, authentic experience. Sometimes, the right path isn't the most obvious one, but the one that lets you breathe and truly grow.
