**The Pixel Promise, and a Little Disappointment**

Okay, so 2022 was *the* year I finally upgraded my phone. I’d been eyeing the Pixel 7 for ages, and when Google offered a decent trade-in deal, I jumped at it – along with the Pixel Watch! The whole process felt slick, like the Google Store was delivering on a seamless experience. 

But then came the slightly awkward part. The trade-in credit only applied to the phone itself. Suddenly, I was staring down a hefty Google Store credit for the Watch, which wasn’t exactly what I’d envisioned. It felt a little…deceptive, honestly. 

It’s funny how these things happen, isn't it? You go in hoping for a straightforward deal, and end up with a slightly unexpected outcome. It’s a reminder to always read the fine print, and maybe a gentle nudge to question those seemingly perfect offers. Still, I’m enjoying my new phone – it’s just a little bittersweet.
