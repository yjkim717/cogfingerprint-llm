As a lifelong coffee devotee, I never thought I’d say this, but in 2022, I found a new morning ritual. After one too many jitters, I went hunting for a strong, high-caffeine black tea—something robust enough to stand up to a splash of milk without tasting weak. I finally discovered a rich, loose-leaf blend that gives me that needed kick for under $1.50 a cup. It’s been a game-changer, offering warmth and focus without the coffee crash. Sometimes, the best discoveries are the ones you aren’t even looking for.
