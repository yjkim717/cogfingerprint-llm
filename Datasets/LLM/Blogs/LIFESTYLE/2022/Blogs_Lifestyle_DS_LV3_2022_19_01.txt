It’s 2022, and my AT&T Fiber promised lightning speed—but my trusty old AC1750 router just couldn’t keep up with the BGW320-505 gateway. I felt stuck between the new and familiar, wondering why the numbers didn’t match the real-world feel. So, I gave that AC1750 a second life as an access point upstairs. Funny how tech, like life, sometimes needs a little rearranging to truly connect.
