**The Weight of Watching**

It feels strange to be writing this in 2022, but lately, I’ve been carrying a quiet, unsettling weight. It’s not a physical one, but a feeling connected to the news – specifically, stories about the refugee crisis and how it’s being handled.  I keep thinking about how easily complex issues can be twisted, how a desperate situation can become a tool for political gain. 

It’s easy to feel helpless, isn’t it? To switch off and pretend it’s not happening. But I think we all have a responsibility, even if it’s just to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth: that human suffering shouldn't be used to bolster someone’s power.  It's a reminder that empathy, and a demand for accountability, matters. 

What are you feeling lately?  Let's talk about it.
