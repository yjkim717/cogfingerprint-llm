**Is Your Long-Distance Chat Just… Routine?**

Let’s be honest, 2022 has felt a lot like a well-worn groove, hasn't it? Between work, family, and just *existing*, carving out quality time feels like a monumental task. I’ve been feeling it too, especially when it comes to my long-distance relationship. 

Recently, my calls with my partner started feeling…flat. Just a quick check-in, a brief rundown of the day. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t sparking anything. It highlighted how easily connection can fade when life gets relentlessly busy. 

I realized we needed to inject some intentional romance back in. Small things – a silly shared joke, really listening to what he’s *actually* sharing, even just asking about his favorite coffee shop. It’s about reminding him (and myself!) that this connection is worth prioritizing, even amidst the chaos. 

What about you? How are you keeping the spark alive when life gets hectic?
