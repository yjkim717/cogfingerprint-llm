As I strolled through the bustling streets of Istanbul in 2022, I couldn't help but think about the refugee issue that's been plaguing Turkey. The government's handling of the situation has been a topic of heated debate, with some parties fueling hatred towards refugees. It's time for a change. We need a government that will work towards a solution, not perpetuate the problem. Let's use our votes wisely and choose a party that will bring about a more harmonious and inclusive society for all, regardless of their background.
