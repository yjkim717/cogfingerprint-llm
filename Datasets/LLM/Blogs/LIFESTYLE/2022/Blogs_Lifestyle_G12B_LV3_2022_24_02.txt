>## The Vegan Spotlight Feels a Little…Dim?

Okay, let’s be honest. As a long-time vegan, I've been feeling a bit conflicted lately. It's fantastic to see vegan dishes popping up on TV cooking specials – a real win for visibility, right? But then I notice something. These chefs, who’ve just whipped up a gorgeous lentil shepherd’s pie or a surprisingly delicious jackfruit "pulled pork," seem to effortlessly slide back into searing steaks and roasting chickens the very next segment.

It’s not that I begrudge them their carnivorous comfort! But where’s the acknowledgement? Where's the nod to the incredible innovators who’ve spent years perfecting these meat substitutes and plant-based recipes? It feels a little…disingenuous. 

I’m not asking for a full conversion, just a little respect for the journey. Veganism isn't a trend; it’s a conscious choice, and the folks pushing these alternatives deserve more than a fleeting spotlight before returning to the familiar. Maybe 2023 will bring a little more authenticity to the culinary conversation?
