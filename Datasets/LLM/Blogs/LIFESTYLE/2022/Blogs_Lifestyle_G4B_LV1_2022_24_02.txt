**The Vegan Flash and the Steak Night**

Remember last year, how every other cooking show seemed to have a brief, shiny vegan phase? Gorgeous plant-based dishes, enthusiastic declarations about a better future… and then, *bam*, back to perfectly marbled steaks. It felt a little disingenuous, honestly. 

I get it – TV needs to appeal to a broad audience. But it felt like a marketing tactic, a quick dip into a trending topic before reverting to what sells. I’m all for exploring plant-based options, but I crave genuine passion, not a fleeting endorsement.  Maybe it's me, but it highlighted how easily we can be swayed by the latest buzz. What do you think?
