**The Unexpected Ripple Effect of a Flash**

2022 felt like a year of little anxieties piling up, didn’t it? I was relying more and more on delivery apps – Doordash, Grubhub, the whole shebang – for a quick dinner and a bit of convenience. Then, last month, it happened. A minor car accident, triggered by a confusing flashing yellow light. 

Suddenly, I was wrestling with fault, insurance paperwork, and a whole lot of uncertainty. It forced me to really think about responsibility – not just behind the wheel, but in a world increasingly reliant on apps and instant gratification.  

It’s made me more aware of the potential ripple effects of our choices, how a simple flash of color can completely disrupt the calm.  It’s a reminder to be present, to pay attention, and to maybe, just maybe, appreciate the slower moments a little more.
