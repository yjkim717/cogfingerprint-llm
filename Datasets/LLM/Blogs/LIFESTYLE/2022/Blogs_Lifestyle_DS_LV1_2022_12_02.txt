It’s 2022, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how we connect—not just with people, but with stories. The other day, I asked online for Willem Dafoe movie suggestions I’d missed. The response was overwhelming; strangers shared their favorite performances, turning a simple query into a shared celebration of art. It reminded me that even in our digital routines, we’re all just looking for meaningful exchanges. Sometimes, the best lifestyle upgrade is remembering the human passion behind every screen.
