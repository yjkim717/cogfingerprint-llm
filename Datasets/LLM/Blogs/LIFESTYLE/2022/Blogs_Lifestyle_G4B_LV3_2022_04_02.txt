**The Silent Rebellion of My Garage Door**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of small, persistent irritations. Big, dramatic things happened, of course, but it was the little things – the ones that chipped away at your peace – that really stuck with me. And lately, that’s been my garage door. 

It started subtly – a little hesitation when it tried to close, a jiggle here, a wobble there. I’d shrug it off, assuming it was just getting a bit stiff. But then it escalated. Now, it’s a full-blown, intermittent rebellion. Sometimes it flies open perfectly, other times it slams shut with a jarring thud, and occasionally, it just… refuses to move at all. 

The frustration is real. It’s not just about the inconvenience of hauling groceries inside; it’s the feeling of being thwarted by something so utterly basic. Like a tiny, metal gremlin is deliberately making my life harder. 

I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to diagnose the problem – researching thresholds, obsessing over mechanical issues. It’s a surprisingly complex world of springs and rollers!  It’s a reminder that even in a year filled with big changes, sometimes the biggest battles are fought over the simplest, most stubbornly resistant things. And maybe, just maybe, a little bit of patience is needed, just like with a recalcitrant garage door.
