## The Next Chapter: Code, Coffee, and a World of Possibilities

Okay, so I did it. I graduated with a software engineering degree! Feels a little surreal, honestly. But the excitement is quickly followed by a giant question mark: what now? I'm staring down the barrel of potential – grad school, maybe? A job overseas? It’s a *lot* to consider.

2022 feels like a pivotal year for so many of us, doesn’t it? The world's shifting, and I'm itching to be part of something bigger, something that blends my coding passion with a global perspective. I’m reaching out to anyone out there who’s navigated this path – what were your biggest hurdles? Any tips on finding those dream international roles? And, let’s be real, those scholarships would be *amazing*. Send good vibes (and advice!) my way!
