**The Year We Almost Did It Alone**

2022 felt like a year of quiet desperation, honestly. We were determined to buy a house – *our* house – but it quickly became clear we were swimming against the current. Endless open houses, frantic online searches, and a whole lot of “no thanks” from sellers. 

There was a point, smack-dab in the middle of it all, where I started to wonder if our buyer's agent was just…wasting their time. Were we truly unfindable? Was our enthusiasm off-putting? It felt incredibly frustrating to feel like we were putting someone’s expertise to use, only to be met with silence. 

Ultimately, we realized it wasn't about *them* wasting their time. It was about *us* needing a different approach.  It was a humbling reminder that sometimes, even with the best intentions, you need a little professional guidance to navigate the chaos of home buying.
