As I tinkered with my 3D printing setup in 2022, I discovered the perfect harmony between technology and patience. Using Klipper with my BTT Octopus and Raspberry Pi, I was able to streamline my printing process. I even figured out how to send a pause command using Superslicer, making it easier to intervene when needed. This journey taught me to appreciate the beauty of slowing down and being present, even in a world of rapid innovation. It's a lesson that's stayed with me, influencing my daily life and approach to hobbies.
