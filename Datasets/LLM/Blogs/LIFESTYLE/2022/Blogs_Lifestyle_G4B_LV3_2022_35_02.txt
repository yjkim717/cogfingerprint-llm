**The Day the Line Went Tight**

2022 felt like a year of pushing boundaries, both in my career and, as many of you know, in my pursuit of the perfect fish. I’d been tracking rumors of a monster snook – or redfish, depending on who you asked – lurking in the Bob Sikes Cut.  I’d packed my new braid, meticulously tying every knot with obsessive care, convinced this was *the* trip. 

And it was.  The fight was unbelievable.  A true test of strength and patience.  The rod bent double, the line screaming off the reel… then, suddenly, a snap.  Gear failure.  Frustration flared, quickly followed by a strange calm. 

As the fish finally surfaced, a flash of silver in the murky water, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was looking at.  It was massive, undeniably powerful, but… oddly shy.  It was a humbling experience, really.  A reminder that sometimes, the thrill isn't just about landing the catch, but about the raw, visceral connection to something wild and powerful.  It’s a feeling I’ll carry with me long after the frayed braid is replaced.
