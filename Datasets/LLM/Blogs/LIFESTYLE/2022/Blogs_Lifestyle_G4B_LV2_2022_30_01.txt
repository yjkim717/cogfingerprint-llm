**The Ghosts in My Camera Bag**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How objects can hold so much more than just their physical form. Lately, I’ve been spending a lot of time with a Polaroid camera – a real, honest-to-goodness vintage one – and it’s unearthed a whole heap of memories. 

It belonged to my grandfather. He wasn't a flashy guy, but he had this incredible eye for detail and a quiet appreciation for the simple things.  When he passed, it came to me, tucked away in a box of his old belongings. 

Recently, I was watching *Mad Men* and a scene popped into my head – Don Draper, holding a Polaroid, capturing a fleeting moment of beauty. It felt… resonant. Suddenly, this old camera wasn't just a relic; it was a little piece of his world.

But using it in 2022? It’s a challenge! The wait for the photo to develop, the potential for a less-than-perfect image… it forces you to slow down. To really *look* at what you're capturing. 

It’s a beautiful kind of frustrating, really. Like chasing ghosts – a tangible connection to the past, reminding me to appreciate the present, and maybe, just maybe, to find a little bit of that quiet appreciation in my own life.  Anyone else have a treasured object that sparks unexpected memories?
