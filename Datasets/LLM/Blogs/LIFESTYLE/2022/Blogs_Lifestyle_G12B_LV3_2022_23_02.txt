## The Worry That Lingers: A Little Corgi and a Big Reminder

It’s funny how a post on Reddit can stop you in your tracks. I saw someone sharing about a lost corgi mix – a little guy, uncollared, last seen near Shands on the UF campus. My heart just sank. It’s a sharp reminder of the fragility of things, isn’t it? 

We get so caught up in our routines, our plans, our carefully constructed lives. But in an instant, something – a lost pet, a sudden change – can disrupt everything. It made me think about all the little things I take for granted, the connections I have, and the importance of appreciating them *now*. I really hope that little corgi finds his way home. It’s a small wish, but it carries a bigger message about cherishing what we have.
