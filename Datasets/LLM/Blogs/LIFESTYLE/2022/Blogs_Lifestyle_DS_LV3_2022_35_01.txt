There’s something humbling about standing on a weathered Ohio River dock in 2022, the current pulling relentlessly. I used to fight it, until I learned to adapt. I switched to a three-way sinker rig, letting my bait hold steady in that fast-moving water. It’s a small change, but it’s a lesson that’s stuck with me far beyond fishing. Sometimes, the secret isn't to push harder against the flow, but to find a smarter way to stay grounded and present, right where you need to be.
