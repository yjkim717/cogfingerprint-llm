**The Slow Soak: Finding Patience in Everyday Processes**

2022 felt… frantic, didn’t it? A constant rush to *do* things, to optimize, to squeeze every last drop out of the day. But lately, I’ve been deliberately slowing down, and it’s been surprisingly profound. 

It started with a fascination with how my grandmother used to make jams. She’d let the fruit simmer for *hours*, patiently stirring, almost like a tiny, liquid ballet.  It made me think about extracting something valuable – flavor, essence – from seemingly simple things. 

That’s led me to this weird, intriguing line of thought about how we approach even the smallest tasks. Like extracting liquid from ground food particles, only instead of food, it's maybe a feeling, a skill, or a connection. It reminded me of packed bed reactors – a system where things move slowly, relying on diffusion and circulation to achieve a result. 

I'm learning that sometimes, the best results come not from forcing, but from letting things happen at their own pace. It's about embracing the “solvent circulation” of life – allowing space for things to integrate and truly be absorbed.
