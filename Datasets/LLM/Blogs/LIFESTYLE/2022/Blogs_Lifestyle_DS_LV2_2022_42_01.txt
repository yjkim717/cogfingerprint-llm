It’s 2022, and my car has decided it has a mind of its own. One minute, I’m cruising along, lost in a podcast; the next, the engine shudders like it’s caught a chill, the gas pedal goes limp, and everything just… stops. Mechanics have scratched their heads, run diagnostics, and sent me on my way with a shrug and a hefty bill. “Intermittent,” they say. I say it’s a metaphor.

Isn’t life just like that sometimes? We’re rolling along smoothly, and then—out of nowhere—a rough patch hits. Power fades; control slips away. You troubleshoot, seek experts, but some issues don’t have quick fixes. They’re part of the journey, reminding us to slow down, breathe, and appreciate the stretches of open road when they come. Maybe my Impala isn’t just a car—it’s my quirky co-pilot, teaching me patience on the ride.
