### The Static Between Us

It was 2022, and our 15-year rhythm had hit a patch of static. My partner and I were navigating a temporary long-distance chapter, and our nightly phone calls had becomeâ€¦ transactional. "How was work?" "Fine." "What did you have for dinner?" "Pasta." We were ticking the communication box, but the romantic connection was fading under the weight of our daily routines.

I realized we weren't sharing an experience; we were just exchanging reports. So, I started changing the questions. Instead of "How was your day?" I asked, "What made you laugh today?" or "If you could beam us to any restaurant right now, where would we go?"

Suddenly, our calls were filled with stories and silly hypotheticals. We weren't just updating each other; we were building a new world, one conversation at a time. The distance didn't feel so vast when we were dreaming together.
