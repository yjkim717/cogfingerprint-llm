"As I dove back into Elden Ring on my PC, I was excited to continue my journey through the Lands Between. But, my enthusiasm was short-lived. When I grabbed my trusty PS5 controller, I was hit with a frustrating lag issue that made the game almost unplayable. At first, I thought it was just a minor glitch, but after some digging, I discovered that the motion sensor on the controller might be the culprit. It turns out, some PC gamers have reported similar issues when using the PS5 controller with certain games. I switched to a different controller and the lag disappeared. It was a simple fix, but it made a huge difference. It got me thinking - how often do we overlook the little things that can greatly impact our gaming (and overall) experience? This little hiccup was a great reminder to stay curious and keep tweaking."
