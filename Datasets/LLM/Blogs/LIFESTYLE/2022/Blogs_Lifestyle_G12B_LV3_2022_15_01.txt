## Predicted Grades Got You Anxious? You're Not Alone.

Okay, deep breaths everyone. It's 2022, and the UCAS application process is looming. I was just chatting with a friend the other day, totally stressing about predicted grades. They’d been offered AAC, but worried a potential ‘C’ in one subject would close doors. 

It’s a valid fear! But here’s the thing: predicted grades are just *predictions*. Strong exam performance, really showing what you know, can absolutely make a difference. Don’t let those initial predictions define you. Focus on those grade boundaries, work hard, and trust in your ability. You've got this!
