>## Trading Lava Rocks for Cornfields: Rethinking Adventure in 2022

Remember that trip to the Galapagos? It feels like a lifetime ago now. 2019. Blue-footed boobies, volcanic landscapes, the sheer *otherness* of it all. It genuinely changed something in me – a thirst for experiencing the wild, for stepping outside my everyday. 

But 2022 feels different, doesn’t it? The world has shifted. International travel feels… complicated. Lately, I've been feeling a pull to that same sense of adventure, but closer to home. 

My brain keeps circling back to possibilities. Maybe a car rental road trip through the Midwest, exploring state parks and hiking trails? I'm picturing golden fields of corn, quiet lakes, and evenings spent under a blanket of stars.  It's a drastically different landscape than the Galapagos, certainly. No penguins, no giant tortoises. 

But the core desire remains: to disconnect, to breathe fresh air, to feel small and insignificant in the face of something bigger than myself.  Anyone else feeling the urge to trade the exotic for the familiar, but still find that spark of adventure? I’m open to suggestions!
