That moment of pure dread hit me in late 2022. I’d just opened a new Amax card, touted for its amazing rewards. But my company’s slow reimbursement cycle meant I’d be carrying a balance, accruing interest I couldn’t afford. Closing it immediately felt like the only sane move to stop the financial bleeding, yet I’d tank my credit score. I was trapped between my present bank account and my future financial flexibility. It was a stark lesson that the "perfect" card doesn't exist in a vacuum, but in the messy reality of your own life.
