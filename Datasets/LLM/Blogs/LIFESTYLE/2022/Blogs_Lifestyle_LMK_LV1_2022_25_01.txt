"Rattled by a Close Call: Navigating the Aftermath of a Dash Accident. As I reflect on my 2022 experience as a Doordash driver, one incident still makes me shake my head - a car accident at a flashing yellow intersection in Louisiana. I had the right of way, but another driver blew through the intersection, and we collided. Now, I'm left dealing with the aftermath, trying to determine fault and navigating the complex world of insurance claims. Louisiana laws can be tricky, and insurance companies often have their own agendas. As I share my story, I hope to gain insight from others who've been in similar situations. How do you handle the stress of being involved in an accident while working for a gig economy company like Doordash?"
