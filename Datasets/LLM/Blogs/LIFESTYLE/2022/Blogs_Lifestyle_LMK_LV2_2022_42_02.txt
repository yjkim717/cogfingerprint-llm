The 4th of July weekend chaos is real! As I navigated the busy aisles of our local butcher shop, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with customers making special requests left and right. "Can you cut it extra thin?" "Can I get a custom blend?" Don't get me wrong, I love accommodating customers, but during peak hours, it's a challenge. As I worked in the meat department, juggling multiple orders and requests, I realized that sometimes it's not just about the sale â€“ it's about finding a balance between customer satisfaction and our sanity. How do you handle busy weekends?
