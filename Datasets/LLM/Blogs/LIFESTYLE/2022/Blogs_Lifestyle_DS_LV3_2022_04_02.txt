### The Garage Door and the Unfinished Things

It’s funny how the most mundane household objects can become metaphors for our lives. For me, in the summer of 2022, it was my garage door opener.

It started subtly. A slight hesitation before the familiar hum, then a stubborn refusal to seal completely, leaving a four-inch sliver of the outside world visible. I’d reset the thresholds, watch it travel its track, and hold my breath. Sometimes it would obey. Other times, it would judder to a halt just shy of its goal, as if it had simply lost the will to finish the job.

We’d had a rough winter. A misaligned track, a rusty chain—things that had been patched up but never truly made whole again. The repairs had addressed the immediate crisis, but the memory of the damage remained in its mechanics.

And isn't that just like us? We go through our own bumps and jolts—a stressful project at work, a personal disappointment—and we do the work to get back on track. We reset our personal thresholds, tell ourselves we’re fine. But sometimes, we still stop short. We can’t quite muster the energy to be fully "open" and engaged, or we can’t completely "close" the door on a worry. The chain of our day gets a little slack, and the momentum just… fizzles.

Watching that door, I realized that consistency isn’t about never breaking. It’s about acknowledging the hiccups, understanding the history behind them, and gently guiding the mechanism back, again and again. My garage door still has its off days, a quiet reminder that some things, once stressed, carry a memory. And maybe that’s okay. The goal isn’t perfection, but the willingness to keep traveling the track, even if the journey is occasionally incomplete.
