### The Text That Changed Everything

It was a Tuesday in 2022, and my phone buzzed with a frantic message from my cousin about her 15-year-old son. The school had called; a group of friends had a shared album of… let’s just say, very personal photos. My first thought was typical teen stupidity. My second, after a quick, horrified internet search, was sheer terror.

I learned that what we dismissed as "sexting" isn't just a bad idea—it's a serious crime. Creating or sharing explicit images of a minor, even if it's a selfie sent to a boyfriend or girlfriend, is legally considered distributing illicit images. The consequences are staggering: felony charges and the very real, life-altering possibility of being placed on the sex offender registry.

That night, I sat down with my own teenager. We didn't talk about shame; we talked about permanence. We talked about how a single tap on a screen can echo for a lifetime, branding you in the eyes of the law in a way you never imagined. It was the most important lifestyle change we ever discussed—shifting our understanding of digital footprints from social slip-ups to profound legal realities. It’s a conversation no family can afford to skip.
