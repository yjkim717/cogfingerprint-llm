**A Little Reminder About Keeping Our Kids Safe Online**

It feels a bit strange writing about this, but something recently made me stop and really think about our digital habits – and especially how we protect our children.  2022 was already a year of so much change, and the internet felt…bigger, somehow. 

I was scrolling through Instagram the other day, and it hit me: we’re so quick to share, to post, to ‘document’ our lives, but are we *really* considering the potential impact?  A friend recently shared a story about a friend of a friend whose child’s image was used inappropriately online – it was a chilling reminder of the serious risks involved. 

It’s not about being paranoid, but about being mindful.  Simply asking “is this okay?” before sharing a photo of a minor, or even *requesting* one, feels like a small act of protection.  Let’s talk about digital ethics – it’s not just a buzzword; it’s about safeguarding the innocence and well-being of our kids.  It’s a conversation we all need to be having.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
