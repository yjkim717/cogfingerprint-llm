It was just another Tuesday evening in 2022, hustling for Doordash to make ends meet. I approached the familiar intersection, my mind on the next delivery. The lights were flashing—red for me, yellow for the cross street. I thought I had the right of way after stopping.

Then, the sickening crunch. In that split second, my world shifted from routine to chaos.

Now, I’m left wondering: who’s at fault? My insurance company is asking questions I don’t have answers to, and the fear of rising premiums or even a dropped policy looms over me. This gig was supposed to give me freedom, but one flash of red and yellow has tangled everything in uncertainty.

It’s a stark reminder—life can change in an instant, and sometimes, the road to stability is paved with unexpected detours.
