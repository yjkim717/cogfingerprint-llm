As I binge-watched House of the Dragon, I couldn't help but think about the intricate world-building that made Game of Thrones so captivating. Now, I'm itching for a new fix. Perhaps a recap of the latest Star Wars shows on my Patreon? The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to dive into the next epic story. What do you think - should I trade in my dragon eggs for lightsabers?
