It’s 2022, and lately, my morning coffee ritual has felt different. The news murmurs in the background—endless debates about policies and people, about "us" and "them." It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, to let the noise fuel frustration.

But yesterday, I saw my neighbour, Ahmet, patiently helping a newly arrived Syrian family navigate the bus route. No politics, just people. It struck me how often we get lost in the big, angry narratives, forgetting the small, human connections right in front of us.

My lifestyle now includes muting the divisive headlines and focusing on what I can do—listening, helping, choosing empathy over outrage. Real change, I’m learning, starts not with a vote alone, but with a conscious decision to see the person, not the problem.
