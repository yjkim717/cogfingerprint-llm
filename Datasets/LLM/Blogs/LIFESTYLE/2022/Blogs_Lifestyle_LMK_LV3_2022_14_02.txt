As I sat in my hotel room, staring blankly at the wall as I often do when I'm on the road, I couldn't help but feel frustrated. My work travel schedule had been relentless in 2022, and it was taking a toll on my marathon training. As an ultrarunner, I'm used to pushing my body to its limits, but balancing training with long hours and endless flights was proving to be a challenge.

I've always been someone who thrives on structure and planning, but my work had other ideas. One week I'd be in New York, the next in Los Angeles, and the week after that in London. My running routine, which was once my sanity-saver, was now a source of stress. I'd find myself scrambling to fit in a quick 5-miler in the morning before rushing to a meeting, or worrying that I'd overdone it on a long run the day before a big presentation.

I know I'm not alone in this struggle. Many athletes face the same dilemma, trying to juggle demanding careers with their passion for fitness. So, I turned to my fellow runners for advice. How do they manage to stay on track with their training when their schedules are as unpredictable as mine? The responses were enlightening.

One thing that became clear was that flexibility is key. As runners, we're often guilty of sticking rigidly to our training plans, but when life gets in the way, it's essential to adapt. This might mean swapping a long run for a series of shorter, more intense workouts, or incorporating strength training into your routine to compensate for missed runs.

Another crucial aspect is prioritization. As someone who's passionate about both my job and my running, I've had to learn to prioritize my time more effectively. This means making the most of my downtime, whether that's on a plane or in a hotel room, and using that time to visualize my runs, plan my nutrition, or simply get a good night's sleep.

For me, the biggest takeaway has been the importance of having a support network. Whether it's a running buddy who can offer words of encouragement or a colleague who's going through a similar experience, having someone to share the journey with makes all the difference.

As I look back on the past few months, I realize that my training hasn't suffered as much as I thought it had. In fact, it's been quite the opposite. The challenges I've faced have forced me to become more creative, more resilient, and more determined. And as I lace up my running shoes for my next adventure, I know that I'm ready to take on whatever comes next â€“ both on and off the road.
