**Finding My Balance: A Year of Switching Between Light and Dark**

2022 felt… layered, didn’t it? Like I was constantly shifting between different modes. It’s funny, I found myself reflecting on this a lot while revisiting my Epic Seven team comps – obsessing over “expo teams” and trying to find the perfect “rgb teams.” It made me realize it wasn’t just about battling monsters! 

I spent a lot of the year oscillating between a bright, energetic "auto expo" – fueled by early mornings and ambitious goals – and a cozy, reflective “light expo” – curled up with a book and a cup of tea. Then, just as suddenly, I’d slip into a deep “dark expo,” prioritizing rest and quiet introspection. 

Honestly, it was exhausting at times. But looking back, I think it was a necessary exploration.  Like building the right team, learning to recognize *when* I needed each energy type – each vibe – was key to feeling grounded. What were your 2022 shifts like?
