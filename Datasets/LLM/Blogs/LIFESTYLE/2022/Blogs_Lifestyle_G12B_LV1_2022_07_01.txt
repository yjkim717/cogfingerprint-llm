## My Kitchen's Getting Smarter (and Tastier!)

Okay, I finally caved and got an Echo Show 15. It’s gorgeous, but transferring my years of meticulously curated recipe bookmarks from Chrome felt like a hurdle. Thankfully, Silk browser came through! It wasn't seamless, but importing those digital cookbooks – all those cozy autumn baking ideas – felt like unlocking a whole new level of kitchen efficiency. 2022 is shaping up to be the year I finally conquer weeknight dinners. Wish me luck!
