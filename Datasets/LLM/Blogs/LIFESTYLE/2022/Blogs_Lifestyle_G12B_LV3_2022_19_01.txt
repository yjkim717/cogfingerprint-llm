## The Fiber Upgrade & My Router Dilemma (2022)

So, AT&T Fiber finally arrived! The speed is *amazing*, seriously a game-changer for streaming and working from home. But then I looked at that BGW320-505 – it's a modem *and* router, right? Suddenly, I'm wondering if I should just ditch my perfectly good AC1750 router and use it as a simple access point instead. Anyone else wrestling with this tech upgrade? It’s a small thing, but it feels like a bigger question about maximizing my setup!
