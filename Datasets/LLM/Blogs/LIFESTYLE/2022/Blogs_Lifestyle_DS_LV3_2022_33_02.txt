It’s 2022, and I’m sitting in a tiny Brooklyn café, scrolling through apartment listings again. You’d think after months of searching, I’d be used to the sting of seeing those three little words: “Credit score required.” But each time, it feels less like a practical hurdle and more like a closed door—one I didn’t even know I’d need a key for.

Growing up, my parents worked tirelessly just to keep the lights on. They taught me resilience, kindness, how to stretch a dollar—but not how to build a credit score. No one sat me down and explained that a number, invisible and abstract, could one day stand between me and a safe place to call home.

Now, here in NYC, that number looms large. It doesn’t ask about my job, my character, or the fact that I’ve never missed a bill. It just judges, silently. It’s hard not to feel like the system wasn’t built for people like me—for anyone without a financial safety net or a parent who could explain the rules of the game.

Housing reform can’t come soon enough. Because a home should be about hope, not a credit report.
