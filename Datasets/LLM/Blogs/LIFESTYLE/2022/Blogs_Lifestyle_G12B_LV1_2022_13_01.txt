>## The Pursuit of the Perfect Line (and a Little Obsession)

Okay, so I’ve been on a *thing* lately. A precision thing. It started with wanting a really clean shave – not just buzzed, but a defined, almost sculptural edge. I’m eyeing a foil shaver, specifically something that lets me dial in super short lengths, like 0.05mm. Sounds crazy, right? It’s a surprisingly meditative process, this pursuit of perfect lines. I’m even considering the Wahl 5 Star Finale – apparently, it's got a reputation. 2022 is all about the details, I guess!
