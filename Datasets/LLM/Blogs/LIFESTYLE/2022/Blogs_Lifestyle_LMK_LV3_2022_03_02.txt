As I sipped on a robust loose-leaf black tea, I realized I'd finally found a worthy coffee alternative. For those seeking a high-caffeine fix without the jitters, I discovered that a strong black tea can be both affordable and satisfying. With a rich flavor that holds its own against milk, this tea has become my morning staple - and it's easy on the wallet, too, at under $1.50 per cup.
