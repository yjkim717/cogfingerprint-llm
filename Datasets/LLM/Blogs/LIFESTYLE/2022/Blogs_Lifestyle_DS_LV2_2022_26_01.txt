It’s 2022, and my trusty ASUS Zephyrus G14 was supposed to be my quiet companion for late-night writing sessions. Instead, its fans roared like a jet engine, no matter how many settings I tweaked in Armoury Crate. I even tried Atrofac, hoping for a miracle.

But you know what? It taught me something about life. Sometimes, the things we rely on most need a little patience—and maybe a break. I learned to step away, breathe, and not let the noise drown out my creativity. After all, peace isn’t just about silence; it’s about finding calm in the chaos.
