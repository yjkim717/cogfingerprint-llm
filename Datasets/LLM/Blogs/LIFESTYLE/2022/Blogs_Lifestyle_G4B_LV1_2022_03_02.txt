**Trading Coffee for Leaves**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of needing a serious reset. My coffee intake was… intense. Then I stumbled upon a Reddit thread about swapping it for black tea. Specifically, a *really* strong, unflavored loose-leaf variety. The idea of ditching the jitters for a smoother caffeine kick was appealing. Now, a steaming mug of black tea with just a splash of milk is my new morning ritual. It’s surprisingly calming – and a lot cheaper!

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps explore a different angle (e.g., focusing on the sensory experience of loose-leaf tea)?
