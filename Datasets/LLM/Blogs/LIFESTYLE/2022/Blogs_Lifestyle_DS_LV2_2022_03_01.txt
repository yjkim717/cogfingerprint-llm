### The Road to Myself: How a Van, Sobriety, and Wi-Fi Are Forging My Future

The scent hit me first. Not the sterile, lemon-fresh kind, but the deep, earthy aroma of dust, old oil, and possibility. I was standing in a used car lot in the spring of 2022, my hand resting on the cool, blue metal of a high-roof Ford Transit. This wasn’t just a vehicle; it was a blank slate. A 90-square-foot answer to a question I’d been asking my entire life: *Who am I, when I’m not trying to be someone else?*

You see, the last two years have been a masterclass in shedding skins. I came out as a trans woman, a terrifying and glorious process of aligning my outside with my inside. And almost simultaneously, I decided to get sober. It was like I’d spent my life building a house on a crumbling foundation. I couldn’t just redecorate a few rooms; I had to tear the whole thing down and start from the ground up. And for me, that new foundation has four wheels.

This van—this future home-on-wheels I’m meticulously planning—is the physical manifestation of that rebuild. It’s not an escape. It’s an arrival.

**The Great Vehicle Debate: Minivan or Cargo Van?**

My initial research plunged me into the great debate of the vanlife community: stealth vs. space. Do I go with a minivan, something that blends into any suburban parking lot or city street for seamless *stealth camping*? Or do I commit to a full-size cargo van, sacrificing some anonymity for the luxury of being able to stand up and stretch?

As a trans woman, “blending in” has a complicated resonance. For so long, my goal was to pass, to be unseen in my authenticity. But now? The idea of hiding my home, of tucking my life away so as not to offend someone’s idea of where a person should sleep… it felt like a step backward. I’m not building this life to hide; I’m building it to be more *me*.

So, the Ford Transit it is. I want to wake up, make my coffee, and do a sun salutation without cracking my head on the ceiling. This journey is about claiming space, both literally and metaphorically.

**The Conversion: A Lesson in Patience and YouTube University**

I’ve never been particularly handy. My most significant DIY project pre-sobriety was assembling IKEA furniture while drinking a bottle of wine—a process that often ended with leftover screws and a deep sense of existential dread. Now, my evenings are spent with graph paper and a growing playlist of van conversion videos. I’m learning about 12-volt electrical systems, the R-value of insulation, and how to frame a wall.

There’s a profound peace in this new kind of problem-solving. It’s tangible. When I was drinking, my problems were abstract, looping, and self-created. Will they notice I’m trans? Am I acting “weird”? How can I numb this feeling? Now, my problems are concrete. How do I route the wiring for my solar panels?
