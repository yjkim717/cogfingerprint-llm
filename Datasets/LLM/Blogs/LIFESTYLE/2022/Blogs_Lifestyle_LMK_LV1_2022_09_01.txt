As I've entered my 40s in 2022, presbyopia has become a reality. As a long-time contact lens wearer, I'm now faced with the challenge of managing it. I'm exploring options like reading glasses and multifocal lenses to find the perfect balance. I'm considering the pros and cons of each, from the convenience of multifocals to the simplicity of reading glasses. It's a journey to find the right lens strength and style that suits my lifestyle.
