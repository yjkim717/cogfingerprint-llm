### The Scent of a Memory: What My Perfume Collection Taught Me About Letting Go

It started, as so many things do in 2022, with a deep and sudden need for a project. The world was lurching back to a version of normal, but my own internal rhythm was still stuck on pause. My days were a blur of video calls from my living room, and my biggest adventure was choosing which sweatpants to wear. I felt untethered, a little faded around the edges.

In search of a spark, I found myself falling down a rabbit hole I never expected: the world of niche fragrances. It began with a sample vial of something called Creed Aventus. The name alone sounded like an event. When I sprayed it on my wrist, it was. It wasn’t just a pleasant smell; it was a story. It opened with a burst of smoky, dark pineapple and blackcurrant, like a triumph you could wear. It felt powerful, confident—everything I wasn’t feeling at the time.

That one vial unlocked a new obsession. Over the next few months, my shelf began to fill with tiny glass bottles. I became the person who could talk about “longevity” and “drydown” with a straight face. I’d spend evenings reading fragrantica reviews, my notes app filling with words like “oud,” “ambroxan,” and “vetiver.” I was, in the parlance of the forums, a “newbie,” and I was reviewing everything from beloved classics to disappointing duds with the fervour of a wine critic.

But this isn’t a fragrance review. Looking back at that collection of twenty-odd perfumes now, I see something else entirely. I see a map of my year. Each bottle is a bookmark in the story of my 2022.

There’s the comforting, vanilla-laced scent I wore during a week of brutal deadlines, a olfactory security blanket. There’s the bright, citrusy one I bought right before my first post-lockdown trip, its zesty optimism still lingering in the cap. And yes, there’s the Aventus, which I’d wear on days I needed to feel like the main character in my own life again. These weren’t just compliments getters; they were emotional armour, mood enhancers, tiny time capsules.

The real turning point came a few weeks ago. I was getting ready for a simple dinner with friends, and I found myself staring at the crowded shelf. I felt a familiar anxiety—not about what to wear, but about which *version* of me to wear. The confident one? The cozy one? The adventurous one? In trying to curate an identity for every occasion, I’d ended up with a wardrobe of selves, and it was exhausting.

I picked up a bottle I hadn’t touched in months. It was a complex, floral-oriental that a reviewer had called “a masterpiece.” I’d bought it because I felt I *should* appreciate it. I gave it a spritz. The scent was beautiful, undeniably. But as it settled on my skin, I had a startlingly clear thought: *This isn’t me.*

It was a perfume that belonged to a more dramatic, more mysterious
