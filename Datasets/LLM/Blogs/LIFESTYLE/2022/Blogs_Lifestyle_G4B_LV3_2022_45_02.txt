**The Weight of a ‘What If?’**

Remember last year when we finally took the plunge and started looking at our first property? It felt like climbing a mountain – thrilling, terrifying, and full of unknowns. I’m still processing the mortgage process, and honestly, it’s brought up a really interesting feeling. I recently got hit with an unexpected extension fee, and it made me think about the “lock” – that moment of deciding whether to secure a rate or risk a change. It’s a small fee, but it’s a ‘what if?’ hanging over the whole thing.  It’s a reminder that even in seemingly straightforward steps, there’s always a little bit of uncertainty.
