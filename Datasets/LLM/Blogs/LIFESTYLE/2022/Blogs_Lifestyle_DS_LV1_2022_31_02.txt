It’s 2022, and I’m watching my first foster bunny hop into her forever home. For weeks, we’ve shared my living room—her safe playpen, our quiet evenings. I taught her to trust human hands and introduced her to gentle bondmates. Now, a new family beams, ready to love her. My heart aches a little, but it’s a sweet ache. Letting go is part of loving well. She’s not just a rabbit; she’s a lesson in opening your heart, then trusting it to others.
