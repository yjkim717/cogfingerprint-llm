"Stepping into the Unknown: My Erasmus Adventure"

As I sat in my small apartment in Spain, scrolling through my university's Erasmus exchange program options, I felt a mix of excitement and anxiety. Where would I spend the next semester? As a computer engineering student, I knew I had to choose a destination that was both affordable and welcoming to international students. I began to weigh my options, considering factors like language, culture, and cost of living. Some friends raved about their experiences in Germany, while others swore by Italy. I realized that studying abroad wasn't just about academics; it was about immersing myself in a new lifestyle. In 2022, with the world slowly reopening, I felt a sense of freedom in being able to explore. I was ready to take the leap, adapt to the unknown, and make the most of my Erasmus adventure. Where would you choose to go?
