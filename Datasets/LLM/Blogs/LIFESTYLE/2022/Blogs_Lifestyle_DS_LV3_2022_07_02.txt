The first winter frost of 2022 had me worried. My little indoor jungle of pepper plants, my pride and joy from a summer of gardening, suddenly seemed so fragile. The thermostat war was a real debate in our house, and cranking up the heat for my plants wasn't a battle I was going to win.

So, I got creative. I moved them all to the sunniest window and invested in a simple, affordable grow light. It became my little ritualâ€”adjusting the timer, feeling the gentle warmth on my palms, and watching the leaves stay a vibrant green. It wasn't about fighting the cold outside, but about cultivating a pocket of summer inside. It taught me that with a little resourcefulness, you can nurture growth, even in the most unlikely seasons.
