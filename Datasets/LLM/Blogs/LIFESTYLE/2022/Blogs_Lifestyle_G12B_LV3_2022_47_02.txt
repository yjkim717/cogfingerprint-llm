## The Quiet Revolution of Doing *Less* (and Actually Getting Things Done)

It's November 2022, and I'm pretty sure we've all collectively reached peak overwhelm. The news cycle is relentless, social media demands constant attention, and the sheer *volume* of things we feel we *should* be doing is enough to make anyone want to curl up under a blanket and disappear.  I know I was feeling that way just last month.

I was juggling a million things – freelance writing, trying to learn a new coding language (ambitious, I know!), attempting to keep up with friends, and desperately trying to maintain some semblance of a healthy lifestyle. The result? I was doing *a lot*, but actually feeling like I was accomplishing very little. It was a frantic, exhausting dance of busy-ness, and I was starting to resent it.

Then, I stumbled across the Pareto Principle – also known as the 80/20 rule.  It’s a concept that’s been around for ages, but it hit me with a surprising force. The idea is simple: roughly 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Think about it: 80% of your wardrobe gets worn 20% of the time. 80% of your sales likely come from 20% of your clients. 

It got me thinking about *my* time. Where was I really getting the biggest bang for my buck? Where was I pouring energy into tasks that were, frankly, producing very little in return?

The answer, unsurprisingly, wasn't pretty. I realized I was spending a significant chunk of my week on things that felt productive on the surface – endless scrolling, responding to non-urgent emails, feeling guilty about not being “on top of” everything.  These were the things draining my energy without moving me closer to my goals.

So, I started a little experiment. I began to consciously identify my “main thing.” For me, right now, that’s focused writing – building my portfolio and securing consistent freelance work.  It's about honing my craft, getting better with each article, and truly *enjoying* the process. It’s not about chasing every shiny new opportunity or feeling pressured to be everything to everyone.

The shift hasn’t been easy. Saying "no" to things – even things that seem appealing – takes practice.  There's a certain comfort in feeling busy, even if that busyness isn’t truly productive.  But the difference has been remarkable. By dedicating focused, uninterrupted time to my main thing, I've seen a tangible increase in my progress. I'm more motivated, I'm producing higher-quality work, and, most importantly, I’m feeling less stressed.

This isn’t about becoming a productivity robot. It's about mindful allocation of energy. It's about recognizing that sometimes, doing *less* – focusing on the vital 20% – can actually lead to far greater results and a more fulfilling life.  It’s a quiet revolution, a slow and steady shift away from the frantic chase
