"Upgrading with a Catch: A Lesson in Consumer Frustration"

As I navigated the Google Store to upgrade my trusty old phone, I stumbled upon an attractive trade-in offer for my current Pixel. The promise was enticing - trade-in my device and get a handsome credit towards my new Google Pixel phone. Sounds like a win-win, right? However, upon checkout, I was in for a surprise. The trade-in credit was only applied to the phone's cost, not the entire order as I had expected. I felt misled and frustrated. In 2022, with the cost of living on the rise, such deceptive sales tactics can be a real budget-buster. As consumers, we need to be vigilant and read the fine print. My experience serves as a reminder to always double-check the terms before making a purchase, no matter how appealing the offer may seem.
