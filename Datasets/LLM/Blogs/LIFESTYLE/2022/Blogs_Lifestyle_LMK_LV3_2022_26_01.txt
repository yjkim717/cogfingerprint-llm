"My trusty Asus Zephyrus G14 was my productivity powerhouse, until it started overheating in silent mode. I was in the zone, working on a project, and suddenly my laptop sounded like a jet engine. It turned out the cooling system wasn't functioning properly while plugged in. I realized that a malfunctioning laptop wasn't just a minor annoyance, it was a creativity killer. As I waited for a fix, I had to rethink my workflow and prioritize self-care. Sometimes, it's the tech glitches that remind us to slow down and recharge."
