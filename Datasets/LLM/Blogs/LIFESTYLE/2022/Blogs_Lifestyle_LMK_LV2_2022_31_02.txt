As I watched my foster rabbit hop into her forever home, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. Joy for her new beginning, but also sadness at saying goodbye. Caring for her had been a rewarding experience, teaching me about the importance of love, care, and letting go. As I looked back on our time together in 2022, I realized that adopting out a pet is a bittersweet reminder that sometimes, the greatest act of love is giving them the freedom to start anew.
