## Finding My Spark Again: Sober & Creative

It’s funny, isn’t it? How much space drinking used to take up? Not just in hours, but in *identity*. I felt like "party-goer," "the life of the party." Then, last year (2022 felt like a whirlwind!), I made the decision to stop. Sobriety has been… a journey, to say the least. 

But something unexpected has blossomed. I dusted off my old guitar, started painting again, things I’d let fade. It's not about being "perfect" – it's about rediscovering those little sparks of joy, those talents I'd forgotten I even possessed.  It's a reminder that recovery isn't just about what you *stop* doing, but all the amazing things you create instead. What's *your* spark?
