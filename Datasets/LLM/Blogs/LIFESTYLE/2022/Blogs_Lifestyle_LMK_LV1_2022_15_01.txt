As I navigated my UCAS application in 2022, a lingering worry crept in - were my predicted grades going to box me into a limited university selection? What if my actual exam results surpassed expectations? I recalled the anxious discussions with my sixth form tutors, weighing the risks of "reaching for the stars" versus playing it safe. In the end, I took a deep breath and aimed high. Thankfully, my hard work paid off, and I secured a spot at my top-choice university. It was a valuable lesson in balancing ambition with pragmatism.
