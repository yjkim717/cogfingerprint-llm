## The Quiet Magic of a Tuesday Afternoon

It's 2022, and life feels relentlessly…on. But lately, I've been craving simplicity. I started thinking about those who work in service industries – theater employees, for example. Do they sneak in early screenings? Or do they need a full day to recharge after the weekend rush? It made me realize the power of carving out that quiet Tuesday afternoon, just for *me*, to breathe and reset before the week truly kicks in. Sometimes, stillness is the best movie.
