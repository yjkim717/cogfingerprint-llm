**The FODMAP Tango: A Gut Feeling in 2022**

Honestly, this year has been a rollercoaster for my IBS. A particularly nasty flare-up landed me in a cycle of cramping and discomfort. I dove headfirst into the FODMAP diet – it felt a little extreme at first, but I was desperate.  I’m starting to realize it’s not a quick fix, but a learning process.  Alongside the diet, I’ve been experimenting with probiotics and really focusing on stress management. It’s about finding a gentle rhythm with my gut, not a rigid battle.  Anyone else navigating this journey?
