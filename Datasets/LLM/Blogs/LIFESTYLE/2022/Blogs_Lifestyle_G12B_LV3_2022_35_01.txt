>## The Ohio River & Letting Go of What You Can't Control

There's something humbling about standing on a dock, line cast into the Ohio River. I'm relatively new to this whole fishing thing, and let me tell you, that current is *strong*. It’s a constant reminder that you can’t force anything. You set your rig, choose your bait (still experimenting with that!), and then… you wait. 

It’s oddly meditative, watching the water flow. It’s a lesson in letting go, really. Letting go of expectations, of the need to *make* something happen. Just like life sometimes, isn't it? 2022 has been a year of learning to adapt, to go with the flow, even when the current feels relentless. Maybe that’s what I’m really catching out there.
