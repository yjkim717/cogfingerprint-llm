It’s 2022, and I’ve been diving into GUI development in Rust—a journey that feels like learning to speak three languages at once. On macOS, there’s AppKit; Linux has its own world with QT or GTK. But Windows 11? It’s a puzzle. I’m chasing that sleek, modern look, wrestling with the Win32 API like it’s a stubborn old friend. It’s humbling, this dance between platforms—reminding me that growth happens not when things click instantly, but in the patient, persistent pursuit of something just out of reach.
