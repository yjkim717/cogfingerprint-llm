>## The Digital House Reset

It's funny how technology can mirror life, isn't it? Last week, my Galaxy S9 decided to spontaneously reboot – and wiped *everything*. Accounts, apps, photos… gone. It felt jarring, like a sudden, unwanted decluttering of my digital life. 

The hour spent setting it all back up was strangely cathartic. It reminded me of Marie Kondo, really. Do I *need* all these apps? Do I truly use all these accounts? Maybe a little digital spring cleaning is good for the soul, even if it's forced upon you. 2022 has been about letting go, and apparently, my phone knew it.
