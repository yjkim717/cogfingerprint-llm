As I cast my line into the Ohio River near Louisville in 2022, I realized that fishing isn't just about reeling in a catch - it's about patience, connection with nature, and a dash of luck. For those seeking to land non-catfish, I'd recommend a versatile fishing rig and experimenting with lures like jigs or spinners. The gentle river current and scenic views make dock fishing a serene experience, perfect for unwinding and recharging.
