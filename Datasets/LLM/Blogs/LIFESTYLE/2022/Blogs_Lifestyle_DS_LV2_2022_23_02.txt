It’s funny how a moment can stop you in your tracks. Yesterday, I was rushing across campus, lost in my own thoughts, when I spotted a little corgi mix near Shands—no owner in sight. My heart just sank. Suddenly, my to-do list didn’t matter. I spent the next hour searching, asking strangers, feeling that tug of shared concern. It reminded me that beneath the busyness, we’re all just looking out for each other. Here’s hoping that pup finds its way home soon. Keep an eye out, Gainesville.
