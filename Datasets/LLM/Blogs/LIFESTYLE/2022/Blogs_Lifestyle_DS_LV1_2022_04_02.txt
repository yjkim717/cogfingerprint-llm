### The Garage Door and the Ghost in the Machine

It started with a hesitation. A slight, almost imperceptible stutter in the rhythm of our home. The garage door, that trusty workhorse, began stopping a foot short of the concrete floor. It would dutifully rise, then, with a defeated sigh, reverse course. A reset of the little plastic safety beam thresholds would fix it—for a day. Then the hesitation would return.

This was in 2022, a year that felt, for many of us, like a collective reset that hadn’t quite taken. We were all trying to get back on track after the chaos of the previous years, but something felt… off. The door’s malfunction was a perfect, maddening metaphor. We’d repaired the obvious damage—a bent track from an unfortunate encounter with a bike handlebar—but now a deeper, more stubborn ghost was in the machine. The chain drive, the very heart of the opener, was worn, its movements no longer precise.

I found myself standing in the garage, listening. Not just to the clatter of the chain, but to the silence that followed its abortive journey. It made me think about my own tracks. The routines I’d carefully laid down for my life—the morning coffee, the evening walk—felt like they’d been knocked out of alignment. I was going through the motions, but I wasn’t reaching the threshold. I’d reset my intentions, my goals, yet I’d still reverse course, falling back into old habits of burnout or distraction.

The door wasn’t broken; it was communicating. It was telling me that a surface-level fix wasn’t enough. Just like you can’t reset a safety beam and ignore a worn-out chain, you can’t just reset your calendar and ignore a weary spirit. The real work wasn't in another quick adjustment, but in a patient, sometimes frustrating, investigation of the core mechanisms. What was the real drive behind my actions? What was causing the friction?

Fixing the door required a part we had to order online and an afternoon of focused effort. Fixing my own alignment is a slower process. But both taught me the same lesson: when life keeps stopping short, don’t just keep hitting the button. Listen to the hesitation. It’s not a failure; it’s an invitation to look deeper, to find the worn part that needs gentle, deliberate replacement.
