It’s 2022, and I’m still rewatching old My Chemical Romance interviews like they’re sacred texts. Funny how your perspective shifts over time. In my teens, I was all about Gerard Way—his raw emotion, his theatrical presence. I’d hang on his every word, feeling like he was speaking just to me.

But lately? I’ve found myself drawn to Ray Toro. The quiet genius behind the riffs, the steady anchor in the chaos. Listening to him break down a song’s structure or share a laugh with the band feels like uncovering hidden layers of a story I thought I knew by heart.

It’s more than nostalgia; it’s growth. Just as we evolve, so does our connection to the art—and the artists—who shape us.
