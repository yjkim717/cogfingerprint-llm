**Chasing the Glow: Why My RGB Setup Became a Focus Tool**

Okay, confession time: I’m a bit of a gamer, and like a lot of us in 2022, I’ve gotten completely sucked into the world of RGB lighting.

The deliberate act of building this visual environment forced me to be mindful. Now, when I sit down to play, it’s less about mindless clicking and more about being *present*.  Who knew a little glow could help with that?
