**The Wave Between Wind and Wing**

It’s funny, isn’t it? After years of battling the waves in a sailboat – a grounding, almost meditative experience – I found myself staring down a completely different kind of water adventure: windsurfing and wingfoiling. This summer, I was completely captivated by the possibilities and, honestly, a little overwhelmed. 

I’d been chatting with some friends online, a bunch of fellow beginners grappling with the same decision. Windsurfing felt… established, like returning to a familiar friend. But wingfoiling? It looked like pure, unadulterated joy. 

There’s something about harnessing the wind with a wing – a feeling of effortless glide – that was incredibly appealing.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best adventures are the ones that push us slightly outside our comfort zone.  Right now, I’m leaning towards the wing, but who knows where the waves will take me next?
