The rise of veganism on TV has left me questioning the authenticity of some celebrity chefs. While they're quick to adopt and promote plant-based recipes, it feels like they're co-opting others' culinary creativity without proper credit or understanding. As a long-time vegan, I've witnessed the tireless efforts of passionate individuals who've pioneered innovative, cruelty-free dishes. It's disheartening to see TV personalities reap the benefits without sincerity or genuine appreciation for the lifestyle. True culinary artistry deserves more than just superficial nods; it demands respect, acknowledgment, and heartfelt passion.
