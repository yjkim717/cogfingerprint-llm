As I stared at the email from my lender, my mind began to wander. A $345 rate lock extension fee was staring back at me, and I was torn. Should I pay it and lock in my loan rate, or take a gamble that rates would drop? As a real estate investor, I've learned to weigh risks and rewards. In 2022, interest rates are unpredictable. I'm hesitant to throw good money after bad, but I'm also wary of missing out on a potentially lucrative deal. The decision is mine alone - to pay or not to pay?
