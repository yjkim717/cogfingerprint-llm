As I sat in my cozy home office in 2022, surrounded by screens and wires, I couldn't help but think about the perfect harmony between technology and lifestyle. With the rise of cross-platform development, I found myself pondering the ideal GUI library for my next project. Should I opt for Qt, GTK4, or something native like AppKit API? And what about Rust bindings? The choices were overwhelming. As I sipped my coffee, I realized that the right tool wasn't just about functionality, but also about finding a workflow that brought me peace, and let my creativity shine.
