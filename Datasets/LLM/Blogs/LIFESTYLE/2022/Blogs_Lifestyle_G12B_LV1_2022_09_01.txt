## The Blurry Reality of Reading Lately

It’s 2022, and I’m officially joining the ranks of those needing reading glasses. Presbyopia, they call it – that charming age-related loss of up-close vision. It crept up on me gradually, a frustrating inability to read menus or even a good book without squinting. As a longtime contact lens wearer, the thought of switching to glasses felt like a major lifestyle shift. I've been chatting with fellow contact wearers navigating this same blurry reality, and it's comforting to know there are options beyond surgery! Maybe a lens adjustment or a multifocal contact is the answer. Anyone else feeling this shift?
