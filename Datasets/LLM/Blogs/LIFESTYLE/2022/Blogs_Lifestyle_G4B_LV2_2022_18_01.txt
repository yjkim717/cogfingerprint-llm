**The Weight of Saying Goodbye (and Hoping for Hello)**

2022 felt like a year of big shifts, didn’t it? For us, it boiled down to one really, really tough question: do we uproot everything and move closer to family? It wasn’t a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ situation. It felt…heavy. 

Honestly, the thought of leaving our established life, our friends, our routines – it triggered this weird, persistent anxiety. Not the dramatic, panic-attack kind, but a low-humming worry about the void it would leave. We’d built a solid social circle over the years, woven into the fabric of our daily lives. The idea of dismantling that, of starting over with *new* friends, felt daunting, especially because I (and let’s be honest, many of us!) lean towards introversion. 

My husband kept saying, "It’s an opportunity!" and while I *knew* he was right, logic didn’t quite conquer the feeling of loss. It’s like recognizing a beautiful painting and being terrified of letting someone else touch it. 

Ultimately, we decided to take the leap. And you know what? The first few weeks were a blur of awkward smiles and tentative conversations. But slowly, tentatively, connections started forming.  It’s a reminder that while saying goodbye to familiar comforts is hard, opening yourself to new possibilities – and new people – can lead to unexpected joys.  It’s a process, a messy, beautiful one, and I’m learning to embrace the ‘hello’ alongside the ‘goodbye.’
