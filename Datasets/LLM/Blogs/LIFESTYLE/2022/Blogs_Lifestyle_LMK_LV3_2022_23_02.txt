"As I strolled across the University of Florida campus near Shands in 2022, I couldn't help but notice a lost corgi mix wandering around. Without a collar, it was clear this sweet pup was on its own. The sighting served as a poignant reminder to appreciate the little things - like a pet's companionship. It got me thinking, how often do we take our daily joys for granted, and what can we learn from unexpected encounters?"
