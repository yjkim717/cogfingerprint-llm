**The Weight of a Map, and the Pull of Home**

It’s 2022, and the world feels… different, doesn’t it?  After two years of being told to ‘stay put,’ the idea of travel feels both exhilarating and utterly terrifying. I’ve been staring at a map lately, a ridiculously oversized one of the Midwest, and feeling this deep, almost stubborn pull towards *home*. 

I used to crave those sweeping, postcard-perfect adventures – backpacking through Southeast Asia, exploring ancient ruins in Italy. Now, the thought of that level of uncertainty – of navigating new cultures, dealing with delayed flights, and the general chaos of the unknown – feels… heavy. 

Instead, I’m realizing that maybe, just maybe, the most rewarding journeys are the ones that feel safe.  I’m craving a different kind of exploration, a slower pace.  I’m starting to research quirky roadside attractions in Iowa, charming small towns in Wisconsin, and hidden gems in Missouri. 

There's a quiet beauty in rediscovering your own backyard.  It’s about finding joy in local farmers’ markets, stumbling upon a vintage record store, and truly *seeing* the landscape around you.  Perhaps this year isn’t about conquering the world, but about deepening my connection to the familiar – and finding adventure within the boundaries of the Midwest.  What about you? Are you feeling the pull of the domestic, or still dreaming of distant shores?
