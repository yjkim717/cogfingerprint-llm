That unexpected car repair last winter completely drained my emergency fund, and honestly, it left me feeling exposed. With everything getting more expensive in 2022, my old savings goal just doesn't cut it anymore. I've started a simple ritual: after budgeting for the month, any leftover cash goes straight into rebuilding that safety net. It’s not just about replenishing what I used; it’s about adding a little extra cushion for the new reality. That peace of mind is worth every penny.
