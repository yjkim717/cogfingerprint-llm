It’s 2022, and I finally upgraded to AT&T Fiber—hello, BGW320-505! But my trusty AC1750 router still had life in it, so I set it up as an access point. The speed difference is noticeable, but what struck me was how this small tech shift mirrors life: blending the new with the old, honoring what served us while embracing progress. Sometimes, the best upgrades aren’t replacements—they’re thoughtful additions.
