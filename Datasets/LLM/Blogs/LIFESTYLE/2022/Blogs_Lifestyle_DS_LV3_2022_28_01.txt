As I compared ski passes for 2022, Mt Baker’s $1000+ price tag gave me pause. Whistler’s Epic pass, at CA$860, offers more mountains for less. Is this just a tax difference, or something more? It got me thinking about how we value our winter escapes—and whether we’re paying for the experience or the name. Sometimes, the best deals make you question what you’re really chasing.
