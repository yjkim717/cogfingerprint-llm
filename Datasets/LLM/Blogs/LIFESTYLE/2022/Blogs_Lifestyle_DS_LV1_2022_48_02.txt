After three years of weekend open houses and endless scrolling through listings, I finally asked myself: how long is too long to work with a buyer’s agent? In 2022’s competitive market, I felt the pressure to make offers quickly, but something always held me back. My agent was patient, but I started wondering—was I wasting their time, or just being thorough in finding my future home? It’s a delicate dance between trusting the process and honoring your own pace. In the end, house hunting isn’t just about real estate; it’s about listening to your gut, even when the clock is ticking.
