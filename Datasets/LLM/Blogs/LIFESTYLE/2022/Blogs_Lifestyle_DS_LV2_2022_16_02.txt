It’s funny how a game of Hearts of Iron IV can mirror my 2022 reality. I’d planned this ambitious Soviet run, only for the mechanics to throw everything sideways—suddenly, I was fighting the whole world.

It reminded me of my own year: meticulously laid plans, derailed by forces beyond my control. But there’s a strange freedom in that chaos, a chance to improvise and discover strengths I never knew I had. Sometimes, the unplanned path is the one that teaches you the most about resilience.
