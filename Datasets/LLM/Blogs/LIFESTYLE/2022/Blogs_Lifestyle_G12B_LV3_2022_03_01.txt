## Trading Rehab for the Road: My Vanlife Dream, My Recovery, and Finding Myself Somewhere in Between

Okay, deep breath. Here I am, staring at a spreadsheet full of potential van layouts and feeling… a whole lot of feelings. Excitement, definitely. Anxiety, absolutely. Hope, soaring. And a healthy dose of “what am I *doing*?”

For those who don’t know me, my story’s been a bit of a winding road (pun intended, I guess!). A few years back, I hit a pretty significant wall. Addiction had taken a serious toll, and I found myself needing to rebuild, to re-evaluate everything. Recovery has been, and continues to be, the most important journey of my life. And now, in late 2022, I’m adding another layer to that journey: the dream of vanlife.

It sounds a little wild, doesn’t it? Trading the structured environment of sober living for the open road? Maybe it is. But for me, it feels like the next logical step. The stability I’ve found in recovery has given me the space to really think about what I want out of life. And what I want isn’t a conventional 9-to-5, a mortgage, or a predictable routine. I crave freedom. Connection. Adventure. A chance to truly *see* the country and, more importantly, to see myself.

This isn’t a knee-jerk reaction, though. This isn’t about running *from* anything. This is about actively moving *towards* something. The therapy I’ve been doing has really helped me understand that escape isn't the answer. Healing is. And for me, healing involves embracing the unknown and facing my fears head-on.  Vanlife, with all its challenges, feels like a potent opportunity for growth.

Of course, there are a few extra layers to consider. As a transgender woman, the idea of traveling solo, even in a relatively secure vehicle, brings up a whole new set of anxieties. The world isn't always kind, and the thought of navigating unfamiliar places while being visibly trans is... daunting. I've been spending a lot of time researching safe travel tips for trans folks, connecting with other LGBTQ+ vanlifers online (the VanLife community has been surprisingly supportive!), and figuring out how to prioritize my safety without letting fear dictate my decisions. It’s a constant balancing act.

Then there's the practical side. The budget. Oh, the budget! Vans aren’t cheap, and neither are the modifications you need to make them livable. I’m currently deep in the rabbit hole of solar panels, composting toilets, and efficient water storage. It's overwhelming, but also strangely empowering.  I'm learning so much about DIY, about resourcefulness, and about just how much you can live with when you strip away the excess.

And let's not forget the remote work aspect. I'm incredibly fortunate to have a career I can do from anywhere with a decent internet connection. But the reality of
