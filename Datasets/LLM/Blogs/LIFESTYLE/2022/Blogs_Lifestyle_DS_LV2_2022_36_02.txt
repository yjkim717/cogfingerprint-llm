It’s 2022, and my Galaxy S9 is supposed to keep me connected—but lately, it feels like I’m carrying a fancy brick. Verizon’s 3G shutdown hit hard, and even with 4G LTE everywhere, my unlocked phone drops calls and loses signal at the worst times. I miss spontaneous meet-ups and quick check-ins, all because of this digital silence. It’s a strange kind of loneliness, being disconnected in a world that’s always online.
