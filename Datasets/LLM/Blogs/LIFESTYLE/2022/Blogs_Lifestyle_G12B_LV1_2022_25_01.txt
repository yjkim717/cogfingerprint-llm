>## The Yellow Light and the Weight of Independence

It's funny how life throws you these little curveballs that really make you stop and think. Last month, I was in a minor car accident – nothing serious, thankfully, but enough to rattle me. I'm a DoorDash driver, trying to piece together a decent income while navigating the complexities of freelance life in 2022. It happened at a flashing yellow light, a situation that always feels like a gamble.

Now, I’m tangled up in the frustrating dance with insurance companies, trying to figure out fault. It’s a headache, and honestly, it's highlighted a bigger feeling I've been carrying around – the weight of this independence. 

Being your own boss is amazing. The freedom, the flexibility... it's everything I wanted. But it also means shouldering all the risk, all the responsibility. Suddenly, a simple fender-bender isn't just about dented metal; it’s about potential financial strain, legal jargon, and the constant reminder that you're navigating this solo. It’s a lesson in resilience, I guess, and a good reminder to breathe and take things one flashing yellow light at a time.
