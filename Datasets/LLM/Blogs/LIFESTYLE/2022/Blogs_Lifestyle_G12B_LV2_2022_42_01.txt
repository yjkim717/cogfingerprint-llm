## The Unexpected Detours in Life’s Highway

It’s funny how life throws curveballs, isn't it? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about resilience, about how we navigate those unexpected detours. It started with my car – a 2012 Chevy Impala, a reliable old friend, suddenly deciding to… well, *not* be reliable. Random shutdowns. A rough idle that made me question every trip. 

I took it to mechanic after mechanic, each time hoping for a quick fix, a simple explanation. But the problem persisted. It felt frustratingly similar to other areas of my life, honestly. Plans derailed, expectations unmet. 

It’s easy to get caught up in the frustration, to feel like you’re constantly fighting against the engine sputtering. But maybe, just maybe, these moments of disruption are opportunities. A chance to slow down, reassess, and appreciate the journey, even when it’s bumpy.  Perhaps the best repairs aren't always about fixing the problem, but about learning to drive through it. 2022 has certainly taught me that.
