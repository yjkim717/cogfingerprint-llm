>## The Year of Almost-Driving and a Whole Lot of Patience

Okay, real talk. 2022 has been… a journey. Not the kind with scenic routes and spontaneous detours, but the kind where you feel like you’re perpetually stuck in second gear. I'm talking about learning to drive.

It’s been almost a year now since I started, and I'm facing the reality of retaking my theory test. Seriously, a year! I’ve diligently used the DVSA app, practiced those frustrating hazard perception clips until I could practically recite them in my sleep, and even managed a decent amount of time behind the wheel. The practical test? Let's just say it highlighted areas for improvement. A *lot* of areas.

It’s more than just the driving itself, though. It's the patience you need - with yourself, with instructors, with the sheer unpredictability of other road users. It’s a constant reminder that mastering something new takes time, and that’s a lesson that’s spilled over into other areas of my life too. I'm learning to be kinder to myself when things don't go perfectly, and to appreciate the small victories along the way. 

Wish me luck on the theory! Hopefully, 2023 will be the year I finally get that license.
