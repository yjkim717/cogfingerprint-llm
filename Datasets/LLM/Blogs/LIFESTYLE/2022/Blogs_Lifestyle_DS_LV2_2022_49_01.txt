### The Art of the Distant Conversation

Remember 2022? We were all experts at connecting through a screen, but my long-distance relationship started to feel like a series of routine check-ins. "How was your day?" began to sound like a corporate memo.

I realized our nightly phone calls had become a chore. So, I got creative. We started playing a silly game: "Two Truths and a Lie" about our day. We’d read the same short story and debate the ending. Sometimes, we’d just sit in comfortable silence, each doing our own thing, but feeling the other’s presence.

It wasn't about grand romantic gestures. It was about turning a scheduled call back into a spontaneous conversation. The miles didn't shrink, but the connection deepened, one unexpected laugh at a time.
