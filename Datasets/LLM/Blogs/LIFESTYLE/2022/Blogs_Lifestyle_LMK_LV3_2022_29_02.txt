Living with bipolar disorder can be a isolating experience, especially when trying to share it with friends. I've often felt like I'm on the outside looking in, as if my struggles are misunderstood or dismissed. Loneliness can creep in when mental health conversations are met with awkward silences or well-meaning but unrelatable advice. It's 2022, and I'm not alone in this feeling. I'm learning to seek out connections with others who understand, and in doing so, I'm finding a sense of community and breaking down the isolation that can come with mental health challenges.
