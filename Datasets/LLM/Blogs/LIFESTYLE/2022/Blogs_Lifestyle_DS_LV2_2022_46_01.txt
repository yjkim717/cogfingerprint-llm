It’s funny how a little bend in my 3D printer’s spring steel bed got me thinking about life in 2022. We’re all trying to stay magnetic, to keep things sticking—our routines, our connections. But sometimes, the heat warps the foundation, and the textured surface of our days just doesn’t hold like it used to. Maybe it’s not about forcing adhesion, but knowing when it’s time for a fresh sheet, a new start, and releveling our expectations.
