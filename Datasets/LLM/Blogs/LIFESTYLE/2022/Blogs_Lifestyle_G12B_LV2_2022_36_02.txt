## The Signal and the Shift

It's funny, isn't it? How reliant we've become on a little bar at the top of our phones. I was reading a post the other day about Galaxy S9 users struggling with Verizon after the 3G shutdown – a reminder that even our tech, once cutting-edge, eventually fades. It got me thinking about *everything* feeling temporary these days. Trends, jobs, even the way we connect. Holding onto things, clinging to a past comfort… is it really serving us? Maybe letting go, like those old 3G signals, is just making space for something new.  Anyone else feeling this quiet shift?



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
