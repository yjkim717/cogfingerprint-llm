**The Wave Between Windsurfing and Wingfoiling – And My Soul**

It’s 2022, and I’m officially obsessed with water sports. I’ve been tentatively dipping my toes into windsurfing, but lately, I’ve been seriously considering wingfoiling. There’s just something about the feeling of gliding across the water propelled by the wind – it’s addictive! 

I’ve been chatting with other riders, and honestly, the community around wingfoiling feels a little more… relaxed, maybe? Like a shared joy instead of a competitive edge.  But windsurfing has that classic sailing feel, a connection to a longer tradition. 

Right now, I’m leaning towards embracing the freedom and playful vibe of wingfoiling. It feels like a shift in my lifestyle – a move towards less structured adventure. What’s your go-to water sport?
