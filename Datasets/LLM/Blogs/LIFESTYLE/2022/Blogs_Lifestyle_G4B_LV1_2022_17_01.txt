**The Theory Test Blues (and How I’m Facing Them Down)**

Okay, real talk. 2022 has been a bit of a rollercoaster, hasn’t it? And for me, it’s been fueled by a persistent little anxiety – the dreaded expired theory test. Seriously, who remembers to renew those things?! 

I’m a learner driver, and after my initial attempt fell flat, I’m back at square one. It’s frustrating, obviously, but I’m trying to shift my mindset. I’ve been dedicating an extra half hour each evening to hazard perception practice, tackling those tricky DVSA questions, and generally reminding myself that consistent effort is key. 

It’s not just about passing the test; it's about building confidence as a driver.  Right now, it feels like a small battle, but I’m determined to win. Wish me luck!  Anyone else been there?
