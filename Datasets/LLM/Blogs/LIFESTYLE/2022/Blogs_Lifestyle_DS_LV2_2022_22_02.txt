It’s 2022, and I’m still chasing that elusive work-life balance. My desk setup? A sanctuary. I just upgraded to a 5800X3D and a 3090, squeezed into a Meshify 2 Compact. But the heat was real. I spent hours researching, finally settling on a Liquid Freezer II AIO cooler. It fits perfectly, and my system runs cool and quiet. It’s a small victory, but in a chaotic world, a smooth, silent PC feels like a personal triumph.
