## The Great Ski Pass Dilemma of '22

Anyone else feeling the squeeze this year? I was staring at Mt. Baker season pass prices the other day and just… paused. It’s steep, and honestly, the availability is tight. Then I remembered the Epic Pass and the sheer value – Whistler access, plus so much more! It got me thinking: are we all paying a premium for local loyalty? Or is there something I’m missing? Maybe it’s just a 2022 reality check about prioritizing what truly matters. Thoughts?
