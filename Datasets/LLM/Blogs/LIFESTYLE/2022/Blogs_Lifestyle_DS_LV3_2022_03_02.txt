As a longtime coffee devotee, I never thought I’d find a morning ritual to match that bold, eye-opening kick—until I discovered strong, loose-leaf black tea. In 2022, amid rising coffee prices, I switched to a robust, high-caffeine brew that stands up beautifully to a splash of milk. It’s become my comforting, affordable replacement, offering warmth and clarity without the jitters. Sometimes, the best changes start with a simple, steaming cup.
