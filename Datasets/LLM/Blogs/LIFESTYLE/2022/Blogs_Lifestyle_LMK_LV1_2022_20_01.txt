"My latest DIY hair color experiment went awry! I overdid it on the Ardell Gray Magic and now my roots are a lovely shade of orange. Fingers crossed it fades quickly. Has anyone else had a hair dye mishap? I'm learning to laugh at my mistakes and just roll with it - after all, it's just hair, right?"
