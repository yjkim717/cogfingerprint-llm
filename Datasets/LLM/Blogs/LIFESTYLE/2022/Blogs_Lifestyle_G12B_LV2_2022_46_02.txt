## The Pause Button in Life (and 3D Printing!)

Isn't it funny how hobbies can mirror life? I’ve been tinkering with my 3D printer lately, specifically trying to get Klipper to alert me when a print needs a pause – maybe for a filament change or a quick tweak. It sounds technical, I know, but it got me thinking.

How often do *we* need a pause button? 2022 has been… a lot. A constant stream of news, commitments, and that underlying hum of anxiety.  It’s made me realize the value of intentionally hitting pause. Stepping away, breathing deep, acknowledging what needs adjusting.  Just like that printer, sometimes we need a signal to remind us to intervene, to course-correct, before things get too far off track. What's your 'pause' looking like these days?
