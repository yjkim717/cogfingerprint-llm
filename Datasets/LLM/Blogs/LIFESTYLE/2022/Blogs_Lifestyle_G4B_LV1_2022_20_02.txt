**Secondhand Style & Giving Back**

It’s funny how a simple idea can spark something bigger. This fall, a group of students at my alma mater is planning a massive clothing drive – partnering with a local Value Village to collect donations. They’re really trying to learn from past successes, wanting to build on what worked. It reminded me of my own college days, scouring thrift stores for unique pieces.  There’s something so satisfying about giving clothes a new life and supporting a good cause.  #clothingdrive #fundrive #thriftstore #givingback
