## The Silent Struggle of a Gaming Laptop (and My Sanity)

Okay, so I’m officially throwing a little digital pity party. My ROG Zephyrus G14, usually a powerhouse of gaming brilliance, has decided to wage war on my internal temperature. It started a few months back in 2022 – this weird overheating issue, only when it's plugged in. I’ve wrestled with Armoury Crate, tried Atrofac for fan control, even attempted a full Armoury Crate reinstall (a saga in itself!). 

It's frustrating, you know? You invest in something to enhance your leisure, and suddenly it feels like a constant troubleshooting exercise. It’s a little reminder that even our tech, meant to simplify things, can throw curveballs. Anyone else battling similar tech gremlins lately?
