### The Great Car Seat Debacle of 2022

You know that moment when a carefully crafted plan completely unravels? Ours happened in a brightly lit dealership, right in front of a very stylish, very compact SUV.

We were so sure. We’d done the online research, read the glowing reviews, and fallen for the sleek lines of the Mazda CX-5. Our budget was set—a firm $40,000—and our future family road trips were already mentally mapped out. Then came the real-world test.

My husband and I, with the solemnity of engineers, attempted to install our bulky child car seat in the back. What followed was a comical game of Tetris, ending with the front passenger seat pushed so far forward it was practically in the dashboard. The dream of a spacious family SUV evaporated instantly. That "compact" label suddenly felt like the most important word in the dictionary.

It was a humbling, hilarious reminder that life with kids requires a different kind of math. It’s not just about horsepower or aesthetics; it’s about leg room, cup holders, and the sacred space a car seat commands. Our search had to start over, but this time, with a much clearer—and more honest—picture of what "spacious" really means.
