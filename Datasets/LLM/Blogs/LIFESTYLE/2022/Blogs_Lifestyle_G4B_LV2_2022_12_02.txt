**Lost in the Dafoe Deep Dive**

Okay, confession time: I’ve been completely obsessed with Willem Dafoe lately. It started with a Reddit thread – someone was rattling off incredible, under-the-radar movies he’d seen him in, and it just… hooked me.  I’ve always loved his intensity, that raw, almost unsettling quality he brings to every role. 

I’ve spent the last few weeks building my own list, digging into films I’d completely missed. It’s a surprisingly rewarding rabbit hole. There’s something about discovering a hidden gem, a performance that really sticks with you.  It makes you think about how much *stuff* we miss when we’re just passively watching.  Anyone else have a favorite Dafoe film they’d recommend? Let’s share the love!
