The Chaos of a Holiday Weekend

As I stood behind the counter in the meat department, surrounded by the savory smells of sizzling burgers and the chatter of summer shoppers, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over me. It was the 4th of July weekend in 2022, and our store was slammed. Customers were flooding in, eager to stock up for their holiday cookouts. But what really got my goat were the special requests. "Can you cut this in a special way?" "Can you trim the fat off this?" Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to help, but when the requests start piling up during the busiest time of the year, it's hard not to feel a little frazzled. As I wrapped up yet another custom order, I couldn't help but wonder: can't people just plan ahead?
