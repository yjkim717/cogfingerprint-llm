## That Little Face… and a Reminder to Slow Down

Something small happened today that really stuck with me. I saw a post online about a lost corgi mix, wandering near Shands and the Psychology building. No collar, just this sweet, confused little face. It got me thinking. We’re all rushing around, heads down, chasing deadlines and to-do lists, especially in 2022. 

But what if *we're* the ones who are lost, just needing someone to notice us, to pause and offer a kind word, or just a bit of gentle direction? It’s a good reminder to look up, really *see* what's around us, and maybe lend a hand – or at least a hopeful thought – to someone (or some *dog*) who might need it.

**Notes on choices made:**

*   **Focus on Reflection:** I shifted the focus from *finding* the dog to the *feeling* the situation evoked.
*   **Conversational Tone:** Used phrases like "Something small happened..." and "It got me thinking."
*   **Relatability:** Connected the lost dog to a broader feeling of being overwhelmed and disconnected.
*   **Year Context:**  Mentioned 2022 to ground it in a specific time.
*   **Storytelling:**  Started with a concrete detail (the post) and then moved to a more abstract reflection.
