As I sat in my cozy living room in 2022, surrounded by the memories of a three-year journey, I couldn't help but reflect on my house hunting experience. Working with a buyer's agent had been a rollercoaster ride of emotions - excitement, frustration, and anticipation. It made me wonder, how long should a buyer's agent stay committed to a buyer? Is it a marathon or a sprint? My story is a testament to the complexities of home buying and the importance of a strong buyer-agent relationship in navigating this significant life milestone.
