**Craving Austen, Not Just Sparkle? My Regency Romance Quest**

Okay, friends, let’s be honest. How many of us fell head over heels for *Bridgerton*? It was a glorious, glittering escape! But lately, I’ve been yearning for something… deeper. Something that truly echoes the wit and social observation of Jane Austen. 

It got me thinking about the heart of Regency romance – that quiet tension, the sharp dialogue, and the characters grappling with genuine emotions, not just dazzling costumes. I’ve been on a little hunt for books that feel authentically rooted in that era, and I’m reaching out to you lovely readers for help! 

I adore Sarah Seymour’s Sharpe series (yes, a historical hero!), and I’m a huge fan of Lisa Kleypas’s emotional depth.  But I’m craving recommendations that capture that classic Austen spirit – less opulent ballroom scenes, more thoughtful conversations about propriety and, you know, *real* feelings. 

What Regency romances have you been lost in lately? Let’s share the love and find some hidden gems!
