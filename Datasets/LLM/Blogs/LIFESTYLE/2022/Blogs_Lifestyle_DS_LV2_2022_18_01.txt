### The Geography of a Village

I’ve always believed it takes a village to raise a child. I just never imagined my village would be scattered across three different states.

Lately, my wife and I have been staring at a map of the Midwest, tracing the lines between our life here and the lives of our families back there. The math is undeniable. The cost of living here is a constant, low-grade hum of stress, while there, we could afford a bigger yard, a slower pace, and the priceless gift of grandparents just down the road for our kids. It’s the logical choice, the responsible one.

But logic doesn’t account for the lump in my throat when I think about leaving.

My village isn’t just a place; it’s the faces. It’s the friend who shows up with a six-pack after a brutal day, no questions asked. It’s the neighbor who can spot my toddler from a mile away and has my back without a second thought. This social circle, forged over a decade, is my safety net. It’s the unspoken text chain that arranges a last-minute playdate, saving my sanity on a rainy Tuesday.

The anxiety isn’t about moving *away from* something, but about moving *without* something. Can we rebuild this? Will I find my people again at 40, in a new town, with the all-consuming chaos of parenting as my only introduction?

In 2022, we’re all re-evaluating what matters. Is it the financial breathing room and family support, or the irreplaceable, day-to-day fabric of a chosen family? I’m standing at a crossroads, holding a pro-con list in one hand and the weight of my family’s happiness in the other, wondering if the right choice ever feels easy.
