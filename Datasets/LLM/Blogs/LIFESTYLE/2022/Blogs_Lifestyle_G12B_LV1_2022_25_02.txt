## That One Time I Felt Like Luffy (and It Wasn't About Being Rubber)

Remember that feeling in 2022 when everything feltâ€¦impossible? Like you were trying to hit a target miles away? I had it a lot. I was juggling a stressful job, trying to learn a new skill (coding, naturally!), and just generally feeling stretched thin. It reminded me of Luffy in *One Piece*, bouncing around, all rubbery, but still somehow managing to land a blow.  It wasn't about superpowers, though. It was about resilience, about finding a way to connect, even when the odds felt stacked.  Sometimes, just showing up and *trying* is the victory.
