That spring of 2022, as a first-time investor, I felt the market’s pulse like a nervous heartbeat. My loan was almost ready to close, but timing was everything. The lender offered a rate lock extension for a $345 fee—a safety net against rising interest rates. It felt like a gamble: pay for certainty or trust the volatile winds of the economy.

I thought of it as a lifestyle choice, not just a financial one. Was that fee peace of mind, or a bet on my own luck? In a world of unknowns, sometimes the real investment is in a good night’s sleep. I paid the fee, and never looked back.
