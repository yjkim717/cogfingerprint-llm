## The Yellow Light and the Weight of "What If"

It's funny, isn't it, how a single color can hold so much weight? Lately, all I can think about is yellow. Not the sunshine kind, but that flashing yellow light at an intersection. A friend, a hardworking Doordash driver, found himself in a tough spot recently – a car accident, caused by someone barreling through that cautionary glow. 

He’s navigating insurance claims, fault determination… the whole messy process. It's got me thinking about the ripple effect of even small decisions. That split second someone chooses to speed, to ignore a warning… it can change everything.

It's making me more mindful, I think. More aware of those little moments where I have a choice, where I can lean into caution instead of convenience. It’s a reminder that life isn't just about getting where you're going quickly, but about *how* you get there, and the impact your choices have on others. It’s a heavy thought, but a needed one, especially heading into the busier holiday season of 2022.
