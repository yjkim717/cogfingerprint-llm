**The Glitch in My Routine**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a little technical hiccup can suddenly throw your whole day off-kilter. I was completely absorbed in *Elden Ring* on my PS5 – lost in the Lands Between, as always – when it started happening. These brutal lag spikes, exacerbated by the motion sensor acting up with my controller. 

It felt like a digital frustration mirroring a feeling I’d been battling all month: a sense of being slightly out of sync. Like my routine, usually so solid, was riddled with little glitches.  It made me realize how fragile our sense of control can be, even in a game.  Sometimes, the biggest battles aren’t against dragons, but against the unexpected disruptions in our everyday lives.  Anyone else feel that lately?
