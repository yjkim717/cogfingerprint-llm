**The Weight of a Little Square**

There’s something utterly captivating about the idea of stepping back in time, isn’t there? Lately, I’ve been completely obsessed with Polaroid cameras – specifically, trying to recapture that feeling of a bygone era. I actually picked up a vintage land camera, a real relic, and it’s been a surprisingly intense experience. 

It feels ridiculously slow, of course. No instant gratification, just the anticipation of waiting for that image to slowly materialize. It forces you to *really* look at your subject, to consider the light and composition in a way a digital screen just doesn’t allow. 

I’ve been thinking about the people who used these cameras – the families, the travelers, capturing fleeting moments with tangible results. It’s a little melancholic, honestly, considering how quickly we document everything now. But there’s also a beauty in the imperfection, the slightly faded colours, the physical weight of the film. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best memories aren’t just *seen*, they're held.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the theme?
