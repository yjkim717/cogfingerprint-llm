**The Great Medicine Battle of 2022**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt like a year of tiny battles. Between navigating Zoom meetings, figuring out the new normal, and just generally trying to keep my head above water, there were moments where I felt utterly overwhelmed. But there’s one specific memory that still brings a little knot of anxiety to my stomach – the “Great Medicine Battle” with little Leo.

Our seven-month-old decided that antibiotics were the absolute worst thing in the world. Seriously, the poor guy. Every attempt to get a tiny drop of the stuff down him turned into a full-blown meltdown. It wasn’t just fussy; it was *determined*.  I felt like I was failing him, failing as a parent, and honestly, feeling pretty defeated myself. 

There were tears – mine included! – and a whole lot of creative (and probably slightly desperate) strategies. We tried warm milk, hiding it in purees (which he promptly rejected), and even attempting to bribe him with his favorite giraffe toy. 

It reminded me that parenting isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about showing up, even when you’re exhausted and frustrated, and just trying your best.  And sometimes, the best you can do is hold your little one close and whisper, “You’re brave.” 

What’s a parenting struggle you've faced that really tested you? Let’s talk about it in the comments!

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way – perhaps focusing on a specific aspect, or adjusting the tone further?
