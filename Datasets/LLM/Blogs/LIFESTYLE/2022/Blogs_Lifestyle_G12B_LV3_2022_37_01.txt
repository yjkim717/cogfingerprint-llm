## Still Counting the Scars (and Finding the Interviews)

It's 2022, and the world feels… a lot. But sometimes, a familiar comfort can cut through the noise. Lately, I've been diving back into the world of My Chemical Romance. It feels a little surreal, honestly, after all these years. Seeing them back on stage last year felt like a collective exhale for so many of us.

I’ve been on a bit of a nostalgia trip, reliving those angsty teenage years soundtracked by *The Black Parade* and everything else. And it got me thinking – where are the *really* good interviews with the band? Not just the promotional fluff, but the ones where you get a glimpse into Gerard Way’s mind, or hear Ray Toro's quiet observations about the creative process. 

I spent hours last night down a YouTube rabbit hole, and it made me realize how much those lyrics and the band’s energy shaped me. It's funny how a band you grew up with can feel like a touchstone, a reminder of who you were and, in a way, who you still are. Anyone have any recommendations for killer MCR interviews I should check out? Let me know in the comments - I'm ready to dive deep!
