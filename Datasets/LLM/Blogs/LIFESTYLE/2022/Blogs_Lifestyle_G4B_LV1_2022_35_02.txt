**The Day the Line Broke (and My Mind Did Too)**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of little, quiet shifts. I was craving something *real*, something beyond the endless scroll. So, I headed down to Bob Sikes Cut – just to feel the salt air and the quiet anticipation of a good surf fishing session. 

I was using a sp minnow, hoping for a nice redfish, when *it* happened. A massive, powerful pull, a sickening snap of the line… and suddenly, I was staring at a tangled mess.  No fish, just a broken leader. 

It was a strange feeling, actually. Not disappointment, exactly, but a sudden awareness of the wildness lurking just beneath the surface. It reminded me that sometimes, the biggest catches aren’t the ones you land, but the moments that shake you up and make you realize you’re part of something bigger.
