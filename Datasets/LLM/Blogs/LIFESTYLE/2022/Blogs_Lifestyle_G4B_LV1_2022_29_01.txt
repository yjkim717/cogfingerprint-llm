**Chasing Moments, Not Just Dollars: Our Intimate Georgia Wedding**

2022 felt like a year of really prioritizing *what* mattered, not *how much* it cost. My partner and I were determined to have a beautiful wedding, but the word “budget” felt less like a constraint and more like a challenge. We ended up with an incredibly intimate celebration, centered around good company and genuine moments. 

Finding the perfect wedding photographer was key – we wanted someone who could capture the quiet joy, not just posed shots. And, let’s be honest, scouting out engagement photo locations in Georgia was a surprisingly fun adventure! 

It taught me that you don't need a massive budget to create a deeply meaningful day. Sometimes, the most cherished memories are the ones that aren't splashed across Instagram, but are felt in your heart.  Thinking back, those simple, intentional choices – like our fantastic wedding planner and prioritizing photography – are what truly made our day special.
