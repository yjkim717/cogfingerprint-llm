It’s 2022, and my sleek Zephyrus G14 was supposed to be my trusty sidekick for work and creativity. But lately, it’s developed a mind of its own—the fans just won’t quit, even in silent mode. I thought switching from Armoury Crate to Atrofac would be the fix, a quiet victory for my focus. Instead, I’m still listening to that constant whir, feeling the heat on my lap, and wrestling with the irony: a machine built for performance is testing my patience. It’s a small but persistent reminder that in our tech-driven lives, sometimes the quest for quiet is the loudest battle of all.
