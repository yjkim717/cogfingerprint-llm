As I gazed out at my withered pepper plants on that chilly winter morning in 2022, I couldn't help but wonder: was it possible to keep them alive indoors until spring? I'd invested time and money into nurturing them, and the thought of starting from scratch was daunting. After some research, I discovered that with a few simple tweaks, I could overwinter them on my windowsill. I set up a grow light to supplement the lack of natural light, and made sure to keep the temperature consistent. To my delight, they thrived, and I was able to enjoy a head start on the growing season. This experience taught me that with a little creativity, I could reduce waste and save money. Now, I'm hooked on indoor gardening â€“ and I'm loving the extra fresh produce in the dead of winter!
