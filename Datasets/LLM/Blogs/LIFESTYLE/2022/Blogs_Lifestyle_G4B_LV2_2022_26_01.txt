**The Ghost in the Machine (and My G14)**

It’s funny how technology can feel both incredibly powerful and utterly frustrating, right? Lately, my Zephyrus G14 laptop has been acting like a tiny, overheating rebel. I’d spent ages trying to tame it – different software tweaks, even resorting to a “silent mode” – but it just kept spitting out heat. 

It made me think about how we often try to control the chaos of our lives, applying fixes and strategies, only for things to stubbornly revert. Like that one piece of software, Atrofac, that seemed promising but didn’t stick.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, you just have to accept the ‘ghost in the machine’ – the unpredictable little hiccups that are part of being human, and owning a slightly temperamental laptop!
