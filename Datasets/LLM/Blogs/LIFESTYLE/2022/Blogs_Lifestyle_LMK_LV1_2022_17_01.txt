"Learning to Drive: My Theory Test Tribulations.  I recently found myself back at square one after failing my theory test - not once, but twice! I'd revised for a grand total of two days, relying on the DVSA app to get me through. Big mistake. The hazard perception section was my downfall, and I was unprepared for the complexity of the clips. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: practice makes perfect, and cramming just isn't enough. As a learner driver in 2022, I've learned to take a more methodical approach. I've since upped my driving practice and dedicated more time to revising theory. With the DVSA app, I've been able to track my progress and focus on my weaknesses. I'm determined to pass on my next attempt, and I'm not alone - many of my friends are going through the same ordeal. Wish me luck!"
