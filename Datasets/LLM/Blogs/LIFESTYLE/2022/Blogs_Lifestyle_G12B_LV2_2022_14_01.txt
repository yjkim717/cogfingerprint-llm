## The Green Card Regret (and a Question for You)

Okay, confession time. Remember all those articles about maximizing rewards? About the *hustle* of earning travel points? Yeah, I bought into it. Big time. Specifically, I regret opening that AmEx card last year.

The initial perks were nice, I won't lie. But the reimbursement process? A nightmare. It felt like pulling teeth, and honestly, it just added stress to an already chaotic 2022. Now I'm seriously considering closing it.

But that got me thinking… does closing a credit card *really* hurt your credit score? Anyone out there have experience with this? I'm trying to simplify my financial life, and I'd love to hear your thoughts. Let’s chat in the comments!
