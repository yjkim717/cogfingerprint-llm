It’s funny how a simple tech project—like moving my Debian NAS root to an encrypted disk—became a metaphor for 2022. I was craving control, a little fortress of order in a world that felt increasingly unpredictable. As I tweaked fstab and secured my data, I realized it wasn’t just about privacy. It was about carving out a small, safe corner of my life, a quiet rebellion against the chaos. Sometimes, the most personal revolutions start with a line of code.
