**Lost in the Echoes: Still Obsessed with My Chemical Romance**

Okay, real talk. 2022 feels like a lifetime ago, but I’m still completely consumed by this weird, wonderful nostalgia. Lately, I’ve been diving deep into everything My Chemical Romance – specifically, old interviews with Gerard Way. There’s just something so raw and vulnerable about his perspective, especially when you remember the intensity of the *Black Parade* tour. 

It’s funny, isn't it? As an adult, I find myself craving that same level of passionate, almost theatrical, engagement with art. I’m trying to build a life that feels a little more… dramatic, a little less beige.  Like Gerard, I'm searching for a way to express myself fully. 

Right now, I’m experimenting with ray tracing in my digital art – a completely different creative outlet, but it’s the same drive to capture something beautiful and layered.  Anyone else still holding onto their teenage fandoms?
