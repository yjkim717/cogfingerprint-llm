**Finding My Rhythm: Sober, Creative, and Wildly Present**

It’s Talent Tuesday, and honestly, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it *really* means to have a talent. For me, it’s not about grand gestures – though I do love a good spontaneous dance party! – but about the quiet acts of showing up, day after day, in my sober life. 

2022 was a big year for rediscovering myself. I leaned into my creativity, letting my sketchbook and music become outlets for everything. But the real talent, I realized, was staying present with my family, truly *seeing* them, while navigating the challenges of sobriety. It’s a daily practice, a constant choice.  Connecting with the sober community has been a huge part of that – a reminder that I'm not alone.
