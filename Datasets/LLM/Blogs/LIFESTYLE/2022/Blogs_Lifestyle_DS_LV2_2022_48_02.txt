Looking back on our three-year house hunt, I realize our buyer’s agent wasn’t just a guide—she was our anchor. In 2020, as the world shifted, so did our priorities. Weekends blurred into a parade of open houses, but she reminded us that a home isn’t just a listing; it’s where life unfolds.

When we finally turned the key in 2022, it wasn’t just a transaction complete—it was a lesson in patience and partnership. Sometimes the right path isn’t a straight line, and the best decisions are the ones you make with someone who truly listens.
