## Yearning for Corsets & Accuracy: My Regency Romance Revival

Okay, confession time: I’ve been diving headfirst back into Regency romances. But not the fluffy, Bridgerton-style kind that’s all the rage. I'm craving something…deeper. Something that feels truer to the period. Lately, I've been revisiting Barbara Cartland and Elizabeth Rolls, and remembering why I fell in love with the genre in the first place.

It's not just about dashing dukes (though, let's be honest, those are a plus!). It's about the details – the social nuances, the historical context, the *authenticity* of the world-building. In a world saturated with fleeting trends, rediscovering these authors feels like a comforting escape, a reminder that a good story, grounded in history, can still sweep you away. Anyone else feeling this pull towards a more historically-minded romance?
