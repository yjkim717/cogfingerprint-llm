**Ski Dreams vs. Wallet Realities**

It’s weird how quickly priorities shift, isn’t it? This winter, I was seriously considering a Mt. Baker season pass – it’s so close and the snow’s incredible. But then I started looking at the Epic Pass for Whistler, and the price difference was staggering. Suddenly, a trip to the Canadian Rockies felt *way* more attainable.  It made me think about what I truly value: proximity versus a wider range of resorts.  Maybe a little dreaming is good, but budgeting is better!
