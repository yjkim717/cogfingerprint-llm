## The Quiet Panic of an Empty Cushion

Remember that feeling of security? That little mental cushion you built up – your emergency fund? For a while, mine felt pretty solid. Then, 2022 happened. Car repairs, a surprise medical bill… suddenly, that cushion felt thinner, then gone. It’s a strangely quiet panic, isn’t it? Knowing you’re scraping, watching prices climb on *everything*. I'm slowly rebuilding, one small deposit at a time. It’s a reminder that financial stability isn’t a destination, it’s a constant tending. And honestly, just acknowledging that feels…well, a little bit lighter.
