"Coming out to a conservative Indian family can be daunting. As a supportive friend, you play a vital role in your friend's journey to self-acceptance. Be prepared to offer a listening ear and a comforting presence. Understand the cultural nuances that may affect their experience. Encourage your friend to seek out LGBTQ+ resources and communities for additional support. By being a steady ally, you can help empower your friend to be their authentic self, even in the face of potential adversity."
