As I navigated my decision to come out to my conservative Indian family in 2022, I couldn't help but think of the countless others who've walked this tightrope before me. Growing up in a traditional business family, the weight of expectation was suffocating. But with the growing visibility of LGBTQ+ issues, I found solace in the stories of those who'd bravely paved the way. To minimize a potentially negative reaction, I started by coming out to understanding friends, then gradually built up the courage to have an open conversation with my family, choosing a safe and private space to share my truth.
