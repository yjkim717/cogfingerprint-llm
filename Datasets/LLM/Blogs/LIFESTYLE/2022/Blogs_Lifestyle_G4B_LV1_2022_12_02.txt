**Lost in the Dafoe-Verse**

Okay, so 2022 was a *year* for obsession, wasn’t it? I found myself completely consumed by one actor: Willem Dafoe. Seriously, I’d seen *Platoon* and *The Lighthouse* countless times, and it just wasn’t enough. I was scrolling through Reddit, desperately seeking fresh recommendations – “Anyone else obsessed with Dafoe? What should I watch next?”

It led to a wonderful deep dive. I discovered *Arizona Dream*, *Nimrod*, and even unearthed some forgotten gems. It’s funny how a single actor can pull you down such a rabbit hole.  It’s a reminder to just *look* – to actively seek out performances that genuinely resonate.  Anyone else have an actor they’re currently obsessed with?

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
