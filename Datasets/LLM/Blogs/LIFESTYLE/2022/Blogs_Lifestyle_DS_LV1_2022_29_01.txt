### Finding the Magic in Our Backyard "I Do"

It’s funny how a global pause in 2020 completely reshaped my vision for our wedding. What started as a grand ballroom affair has transformed into something far more meaningful: an intimate backyard celebration with our very closest family and friends.

Suddenly, our budget had a new purpose. Instead of stretching it thin for 200 guests, we could focus on what truly mattered to us. We splurged on an incredible wedding planner who specializes in small events, and she’s been a wizard at transforming our humble garden. We also allocated a good chunk for a fantastic local caterer, because what’s a party without amazing food?

But here’s my current dilemma—the photographer. We already did our engagement photos with a lovely artist, and now I’m knee-deep in quotes for the big day. Is it crazy to spend nearly a fifth of our entire budget on someone to capture just a few hours? I keep telling myself that the photos are the one thing we’ll have forever, the tangible proof of our little, love-filled day. I think my heart knows the answer, but my spreadsheet is still putting up a fight.
