Embarking on an Erasmus adventure can be a game-changer. As a computer engineering student from Spain, I was torn between destinations. I wanted a place where I'd feel at home, yet still be immersed in a new culture. I realized that ease of adaptation, affordability, and comfort with English were key. For me, it was about balancing university life with exploring a new city. In 2022, I took the leap and discovered that studying abroad wasn't just about academics â€“ it was about embracing a new lifestyle and watching myself grow.
