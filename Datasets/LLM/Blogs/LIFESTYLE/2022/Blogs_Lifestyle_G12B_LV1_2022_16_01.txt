## The Unexpected Perks of Saying "Yes" (and a little bit of Czech)

Okay, so 2022 was… a year. But looking back, one decision stands out as a genuine game-changer: jumping on the Erasmus train. I'm a computer engineering student, and the idea of a year abroad felt terrifying and exciting in equal measure. Initially, I was fixated on the usual suspects – Belgium, maybe? - but after a lot of research (and budget spreadsheets!), I ended up in the Czech Republic. 

Honestly? It was the best decision I could have made. Prague is stunning, of course, but it was the smaller towns, the unexpected friendships forged over shared struggles with the language (my Czech is *atrocious*), and the sheer novelty of navigating a new culture that really stuck with me. It pushed me way outside my comfort zone, and I’m a better, more adaptable person for it. Sometimes, the best adventures are the ones you don't meticulously plan.
