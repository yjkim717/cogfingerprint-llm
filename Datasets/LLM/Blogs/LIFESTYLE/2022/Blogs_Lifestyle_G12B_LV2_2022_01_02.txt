## The Year I Started Saying "No" (And Why It Felt Like Letting Go of Everything)

2022. It feels like a lifetime ago, and yet, the echoes of it are still swirling around me. It was the year I finally, *really*, started saying "no." Not just the polite, mumbled "no, thank you" to extra sugar in my coffee, but the genuine, sometimes-terrifying “no” to commitments, obligations, and even opportunities that, on paper, seemed *good* for me.

For years, I'd been operating on a deeply ingrained principle: say yes. Yes to volunteering for the school fair, yes to taking on extra projects at work, yes to weekend brunches even when I was bone-tired, yes to invitations that filled my calendar and left me feeling stretched thin. I genuinely believed that saying yes meant I was being a good person, a helpful friend, a diligent employee, a contributing member of society. It was a badge of honor, a testament to my availability and willingness.

And it was exhausting.

And the floodgates opened. I confessed how overwhelmed I felt, how I felt like I was constantly running on fumes, and how I was terrified of letting anyone down.  Liam, bless his heart, just listened. Then he said something simple, something that shifted everything: "You don't have to do it all, you know. It's okay to prioritize *yourself*."

It felt… radical. Like suggesting I abandon my responsibilities, that I was shirking my duties. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized he was right. I wasn't being helpful to anyone by spreading myself so thin. I was just a stressed-out, resentful version of myself.

So, I started small. I declined an invitation to a networking event I knew I wouldn’t enjoy. I passed on organizing the charity drive, suggesting a colleague who seemed genuinely enthusiastic. I even said no to a weekend trip with friends, opting instead for a quiet weekend at home with Liam and a stack of books.

The initial reaction was… unsettling. There was a nagging
