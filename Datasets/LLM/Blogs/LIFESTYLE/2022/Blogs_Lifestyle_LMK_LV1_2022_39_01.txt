As I navigated my coursework this semester, I found myself juggling multiple classes with different instructors. I was taking PLS 21, ECN 1A, and PSC 12Y, each with its own required textbook. That's when I discovered Equitable Access - a game-changer for students like me. By opting-in, I was able to access my textbooks digitally, saving me hundreds of dollars. It was a no-brainer, and I'm loving the flexibility it brings to my student lifestyle in 2022.
