It’s 2022, and I’m staring at Mt. Baker’s $1,000+ season pass, wondering what I’m really buying. Meanwhile, Whistler’s Epic Pass feels like a steal. It’s not just about skiing—it’s about the choices we make and the value we place on experiences. Are we paying for exclusivity or just missing the bigger picture? Sometimes, the best runs are the ones that make you pause and reflect.
