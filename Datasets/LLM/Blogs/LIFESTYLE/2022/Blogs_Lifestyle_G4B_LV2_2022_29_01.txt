**Backyard Dreams & Budget Bliss**

2022 felt like a year of really leaning into what *matters*, didn’t it? For me, that looked a lot like simplifying and prioritizing. I’ve always been a bit of a ‘collector’ – wanting the fanciest, most elaborate everything. But after watching my grandparents’ 50th anniversary celebration (a beautiful, slightly chaotic affair!), I realized there’s a quiet magic in genuine connection.

That’s how I found myself planning a backyard wedding – a tiny, intimate affair for just our closest family and friends. The thought of a huge budget had me paralyzed, but the dream of saying ‘I do’ surrounded by loved ones was too strong to ignore. 

Right now, I’m wrestling with the photographer cost – it feels like such a big chunk of change! – and scouting out picturesque spots for engagement photos. We’re aiming for something simple and heartfelt, echoing the feeling of our family’s wedding. 

It’s a reminder that the most beautiful moments aren’t always the most expensive. This whole process is teaching me that a little creativity and a whole lot of love can create something truly special.  Anyone else feeling the pull towards a simpler, more meaningful celebration?
