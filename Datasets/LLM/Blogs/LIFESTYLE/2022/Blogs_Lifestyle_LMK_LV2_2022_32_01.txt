As I stood in my kitchen in 2022, whipping up a batch of homemade teriyaki sauce, I couldn't help but think about the joy of creating long-lasting condiments. Not only do they add a personal touch to meals, but they also reduce waste and save money. I'm now on a mission to experiment with new recipes - what are your favorite sauces, salsas, and pickles that keep well in the fridge? Share your ideas, and let's get preserving together! I'm excited to try out new flavors and make my pantry a reflection of my culinary adventures.
