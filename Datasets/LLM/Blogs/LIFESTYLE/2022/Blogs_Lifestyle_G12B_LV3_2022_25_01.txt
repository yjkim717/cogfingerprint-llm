## The Yellow Light and the Unexpected Stop

It’s funny how life throws curveballs, isn't it? Just last week, I was out making a DoorDash delivery – trying to hustle a little extra income in this crazy 2022 economy – and got caught in a car accident. Nothing major, thankfully, but a bit of a shock. The other driver blew right through a flashing yellow light, and suddenly, there I was, staring at crumpled metal and a whole lot of uncertainty.

Now, I'm not a lawyer, but figuring out fault in these situations feels like navigating a maze. Insurance companies, claims, potential legal battles… it’s overwhelming. It really made me pause and think about the unexpected turns life can take, and how important it is to be prepared, even for things you never see coming. Anyone else ever find themselves in a similar situation?
