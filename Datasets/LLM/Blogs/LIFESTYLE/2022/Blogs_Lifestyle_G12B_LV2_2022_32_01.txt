## Level Up Your Fridge Game (and Your Weeknights!)

Okay, real talk: how many times have you stared into your fridge, feeling defeated by wilted veggies and sad leftovers? I've been there *so* many times this year (2022 has been… a lot!). Lately, I've been obsessed with building a better fridge ecosystem – one filled with flavour bombs that actually *last*.

It started with a simple Reddit thread about homemade sauces and pickles. Suddenly, I was thinking about vibrant pickled onions, a killer teriyaki sauce, and salsas that don’t turn to mush after a day. It's more than just food preservation; it's about having instant flavour ready to elevate a simple chicken breast or add zing to a taco night. 

Honestly, it's felt like a little win in a chaotic world. What small kitchen hacks are *you* loving lately?
