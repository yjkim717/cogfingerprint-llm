**The Frustration of a Silent Compiler**

2022 felt like a year of wrestling with tiny, infuriating bugs. I was diving into C programming – specifically, working with strings – and hit a wall. I kept trying to use `strcpy()` and `printf()` like the textbook showed, but my code just sat there, stubbornly refusing to compile. It was maddening! 

It made me realize how easy it is to get lost in the details, to blindly copy examples without truly understanding *why* they work.  That silent compiler became a surprisingly effective teacher, forcing me to slow down and debug, one line at a time.  Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from facing those frustrating silences.
