Looking back at 2022, I realized how much my weekly routine was shaped by those small ritualsâ€”like eagerly awaiting the latest podcast recap. Whether it was diving back into the Star Wars universe or dissecting House of the Dragon theories, those moments carved out space for pure, unapologetic fun amid the daily grind. It reminded me that even in adulthood, holding onto those little sparks of fandom can make all the difference in staying grounded and joyful.
