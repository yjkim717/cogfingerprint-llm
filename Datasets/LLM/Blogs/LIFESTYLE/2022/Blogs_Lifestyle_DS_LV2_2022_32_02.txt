### The Art of the Morning Hustle

It’s 2022, and my morning routine used to feel like a badly tuned expedition team. My brain was the damage dealer, still asleep. My body was the slow support, refusing to buff my energy. My phone? The auto-battle feature, mindlessly scrolling before my eyes were even open.

The result? A chaotic composition that left me drained before I even reached my coffee.

I realized I needed a better "team composition." So, I started "speed tuning" my mornings. The phone now charges in another room—no more auto-battle. The first 30 minutes are for me: a quiet cup of tea, a few pages of a book, and some intentional silence.

The damage output on my daily stress has been incredible. It’s not about doing more; it’s about aligning my actions so everything flows. Sometimes, the best strategy isn't to push harder, but to arrange your pieces with care. My life isn't a battle to be won, but a day to be lived well, starting from the moment I open my eyes.
