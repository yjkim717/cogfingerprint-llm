**Mountain Dreams & Wallet Woes**

Anyone else feel like chasing powder dreams is getting… expensive? This winter, I was seriously wrestling with the Mt. Baker season pass versus the Epic Pass for Whistler. Both sound incredible, right? But the price difference hit me hard. 

It made me think about what we *really* value. Do we prioritize a single mountain’s charm, or the possibility of exploring a whole region?  2022 felt like a year of carefully considering those trade-offs. Ultimately, I’m still figuring it out, but at least I’m asking the right questions!

Would you like me to tweak this draft or create a different version with a specific angle (e.g., focusing more on the Whistler aspect)?
