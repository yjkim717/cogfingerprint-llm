>## The Echo of a Black Parade, and Finding My Own

It’s funny the things that resurface, isn’t it? I was scrolling through old music blogs the other day – a deep dive into My Chemical Romance interviews from the Black Parade era, specifically – and it unlocked this weird wave of nostalgia. I remember being obsessed with that tour. Gerard Way’s theatricality, Ray Toro’s effortlessly cool guitar work… I was *all in*. 

It made me think about how we latch onto things, how a band, a movie, a specific era, can become a soundtrack to a period of your life. And how, later, revisiting it feels like connecting with a younger, more intensely feeling version of yourself. 

2022 has been…a lot. Trying to navigate post-pandemic life, career shifts, the general weight of everything. Sometimes, I find myself yearning for that uncomplicated, almost dramatic, intensity of my teenage years.  Not the angst, exactly, but the willingness to *feel* everything so deeply.  Maybe finding echoes of that passion in unexpected places – a powerful song, a poignant interview – is a way of reminding myself to breathe, to feel, and to keep searching for my own personal Black Parade.



Hope you enjoyed it!
