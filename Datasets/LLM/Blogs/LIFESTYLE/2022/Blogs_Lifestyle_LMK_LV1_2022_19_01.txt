As I upgraded to AT&T Fiber in 2022, I wondered if ditching my trusty AC1750 Router for the BGW320-505 Modem/Router combo would boost my home network speeds. After making the switch, I was thrilled to see a significant improvement. The seamless transition transformed my lifestyle - streaming, gaming, and working from home became smoother. I finally felt connected and productive, enjoying a more streamlined daily routine.
