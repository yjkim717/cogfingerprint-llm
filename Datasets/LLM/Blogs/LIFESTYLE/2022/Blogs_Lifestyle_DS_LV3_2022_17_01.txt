It’s 2022, and I’m staring down my second theory test attempt—a mix of nerves and stubborn hope. Last time, I underestimated the hazard perception clips, thinking real driving practice had prepared me enough. It didn’t. Now, armed with the DVSA app, I’m revising every spare moment: on my lunch break, waiting for the bus, even sneaking in a quick quiz while my pasta boils.

My family keeps saying, “You’ve got this,” and my instructor’s calm reassurance helps. But it’s the quiet moments—flipping through highway code notes, replaying those tricky mock questions—that ground me. There’s something oddly meditative about the repetition, turning uncertainty into something I can hold.

This journey isn’t just about passing a test. It’s about building patience, trusting the process, and learning that setbacks aren’t full stops—they’re commas. And maybe, just maybe, this time I’ll turn the page.
