As I weighed my ski options for the 2022 season, I found myself puzzling over the price tags. Mt Baker's season pass came in at a steal, while Whistler's Epic pass was a splurge. What justifies the hefty difference? Is it the promise of international access or the allure of luxury amenities? For me, it's about the value of experience. Is the extra cost worth the memories and adventure? For now, I'm sticking with the local slopes.
