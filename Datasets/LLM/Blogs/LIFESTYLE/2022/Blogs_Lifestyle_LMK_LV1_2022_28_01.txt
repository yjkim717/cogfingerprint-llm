"As I carved through Whistler Blackcomb's powdery slopes in 2022, I couldn't help but think about the value of my season pass. I had debated between Mt Baker's regional charm and the Epic Pass's global access. In the end, the Epic Pass won out, granting me unlimited skiing at Whistler and beyond. For frequent skiers like me, the Epic Pass was a no-brainer - it paid for itself in just a few visits."
