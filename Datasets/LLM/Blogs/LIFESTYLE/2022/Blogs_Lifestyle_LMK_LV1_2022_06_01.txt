"My recent JetBlue flight was a pleasant surprise - I bought a drink on board and didn't get charged! As I sipped my free cocktail, I wondered if it was an error or a hidden perk. I recalled the hassle of assigning my seat and the stress of using my credit card for the booking. Was this a lovely gesture from the flight attendant or just a one-time glitch? Either way, it was a nice bonus on my 2022 travels!"
