## The Kitchen Reset & My Restless Gut (Again!)

Okay, deep breath. 2022 has been… a journey, hasn't it? And for me, a big part of that journey has involved a very unhappy gut. I'm smack-dab in the middle of another IBS flare-up, specifically the dreaded IBS-D variety. It’s frustrating, to say the least.

So, I'm diving headfirst into a new FODMAP diet, hoping for some relief. It’s a kitchen reset, really – a lot of unfamiliar ingredients and a whole lot of label reading. Honestly, it feels overwhelming, but I'm clinging to the hope that a little dietary tweaking can bring some peace back to my stomach (and my life!). Anyone else battling similar struggles? Send good vibes (and maybe recipe suggestions!) my way.
