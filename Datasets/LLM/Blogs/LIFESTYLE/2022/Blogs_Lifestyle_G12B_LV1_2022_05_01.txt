## Rebooting My Life: Sometimes You Gotta Wipe the Slate Clean

Okay, so I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. Like, *really* thinking. And it’s led me to a slightly odd analogy, which I’ll explain in a minute.

It started with my computer. My old SSD was…well, let's just say it was struggling. Everything felt sluggish, every program took forever to load. I decided to clone it to a shiny new M.2 drive. The process itself wasn't terrible, but the initial boot-up after? Ugh. It was *slower* than before! I spent a frustrating evening fiddling with the BIOS, adjusting boot priorities, trying to coax the system into cooperating. It felt like I was wrestling with a stubborn, digital ghost.

And then it hit me. My life felt a bit like that slow boot. I’d been clinging to routines, to relationships, even to identities that weren't really *me* anymore. I was running on an old system, a digital copy of a past version of myself, and it was dragging me down.

The BIOS, in this analogy, is the conscious effort you make to re-evaluate. To adjust the settings, to prioritize what truly matters. It's uncomfortable, a little overwhelming, but ultimately necessary to get things running smoothly. It’s about realizing that sometimes, a clean slate is exactly what you need.

It’s 2022, and I think a lot of us feel this way. We’ve been through so much. Maybe it’s time to consider a metaphorical "cloning" process: taking the good parts of what we were, but recognizing that the old hard drive is full.  It’s time to prioritize the things that will actually *boot* us into a better, brighter future.  Anyone else feeling a system reboot coming on?
