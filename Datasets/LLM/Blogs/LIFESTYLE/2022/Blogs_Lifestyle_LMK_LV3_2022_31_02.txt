As I watched my foster rabbit hop into their forever home, I couldn't help but feel a mix of joy and sadness. It's bittersweet to see a furry friend find their forever family, but it's hard not to feel attached after caring for them. As I reflect on our time together, I realize that fostering isn't just about providing a temporary home - it's about opening my heart to the needs of another living being. Letting go is tough, but knowing they're loved and cared for makes it worthwhile.
