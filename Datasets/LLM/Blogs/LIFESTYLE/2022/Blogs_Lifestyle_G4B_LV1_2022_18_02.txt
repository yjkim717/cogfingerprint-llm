**Lost in the Static – And Loving It**

2022 felt…heavy, didn’t it? Like everyone was just trying to survive. That’s probably why I found myself completely absorbed in audio dramas lately. I’d devoured *Tribulation* and *Video Palace*, and they delivered a truly terrifying kind of fear – the slow-burn, unsettling kind. It’s amazing how a good voice actor and immersive worldbuilding can transport you. Now I’m hunting for more, seeking those stories that linger long after the final episode.  Anyone have recommendations?
