As I organized my home NAS running Debian in 2022, I realized that securing my root directory was just like securing my personal life - it requires careful planning and a willingness to adapt. By moving my /root contents to an encrypted disk using LUKS and updating fstab, I felt a sense of control and peace of mind. This digital decluttering experience taught me that sometimes, a little complexity is necessary for true freedom, and that simplifying my digital life can have a profound impact on my overall well-being.
