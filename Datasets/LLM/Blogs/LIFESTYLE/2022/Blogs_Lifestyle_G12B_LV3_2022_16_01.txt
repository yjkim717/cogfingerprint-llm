## Erasmus Dreams & Where to Plant Them: A Computer Engineering Student's Dilemma (2022)

Okay, so here’s the deal. I'm a computer engineering student from Spain, and 2022 feels like the perfect year to finally chase that Erasmus dream! The idea of studying abroad has been buzzing in my head for ages, but the reality of choosing a country is a little… overwhelming. 

I’m really prioritizing a smooth transition. I need a place where the coursework is manageable, my student budget stretches (because, let’s be honest, ramen is only so appealing!), and I can actually *live* without needing to learn a whole new language immediately. 

Right now, Czech Republic, Belgium, and Germany are topping my list. Each has its appeal, but I'm curious – which one would be the easiest to navigate as an English-speaking student? Any fellow Erasmus adventurers out there have experience or advice? Let me know in the comments! I’m seriously craving some real-world perspectives before I take the plunge.
