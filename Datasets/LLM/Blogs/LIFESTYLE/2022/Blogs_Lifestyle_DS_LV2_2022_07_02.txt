The first winter I tried to keep my pepper plants alive indoors, I learned a cold, hard truth: my thermostat and my plants were not on the same page. My dream of a sunny windowsill harvest was wilting fast, and turning the whole house into a tropical getaway for my jalape√±os wasn't in the budget.

So, I got scrappy. I unearthed an old desk lamp, bought a special bulb, and created a tiny, warm sun just for them. It felt a little silly, this small beacon of hope on a dark December night. But watching those leaves perk up, I realized it wasn't just about the peppers. It was about nurturing a spark of life and defiance against the gray outside. Sometimes, the smallest light is all you need.
