## The Final Sprint: Juggling Classes, Jobs, and Sanity

Okay, so here's the deal. It's fall 2022, and I'm staring down the barrel of my final semester at UF. Exciting, right? Absolutely! But also… a little terrifying. I’m trying to wrap up my degree while also, you know, *paying rent*. That means balancing two jobs with a hefty course load, specifically EEL3872 and ALS3200C. 

Anyone else ever felt like they were spinning too many plates? I’m really hoping to hear from those who've taken these courses before - what’s the workload like? Are they brutally difficult? I’m all about pushing myself, but maintaining some semblance of work-life balance (a mythical creature, I know) is a priority. Send help... and study tips!
