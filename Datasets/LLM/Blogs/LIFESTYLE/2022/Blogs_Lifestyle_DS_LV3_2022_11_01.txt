It was supposed to be a simple switch. After riding the bleeding edge with openSUSE Tumbleweed for so long, I craved stability and made the leap to Leap in late 2022. My fresh GNOME desktop looked pristine, a clean slate. But then, a familiar ritual betrayed me. I clicked the Firefox icon, ready to dive into the day's news, and my entire system seized up. Completely unresponsive. That quiet hum of the computer was the only sound, a digital tomb. I had no choice but to hold down the power button, my modern workflow halted by a single browser tab. It was a stark reminder that sometimes, the quest for a smoother digital life can lead to the most frustrating roadblocks.
