**Chasing Flavor: A Year of Homemade Adventures**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of searching for *real* flavor. Scrolling through endless takeout menus just wasn’t cutting it. I started experimenting with building my own sauces and condiments – a little teriyaki magic, a spicy salsa kick, and even a surprisingly delightful pickle brine. 

It wasn’t about fancy recipes, really. It was about taking control of what went into my food and layering those little bursts of homemade goodness.  I found myself adding a splash of teriyaki to my stir-fries, a spoonful of salsa to tacos, and a pickled element to salads. 

It’s a surprisingly meditative process, and it’s shifted my whole approach to cooking.  Now, I’m not just feeding myself; I'm crafting experiences.  What small flavor adventures are you building this year?
