### The Uncomfortable Truth About Power and Our Morning Coffee Morality

It was late 2022, and I was curled up on the couch, finally catching up on *The Boys*. You know the scene—the one where they’re debating Compound V. The "good guys" were arguing it was an unnatural, immoral cheat. And part of me, the part that sips fair-trade coffee and recycles diligently, nodded along. Of course, we shouldn’t play god. Of course, absolute power corrupts.

But then I paused my screen.

I thought about the "supes" in my own life. Not super-powered individuals, but the overwhelming systems and people who hold disproportionate power. The landlord who ignores repair requests. The algorithm that dictates my self-worth. The relentless, 24/7 news cycle of existential threats. We’re all just normal humans, trying to play by the rules, facing forces that feel… super-powered.

And that’s where the tension snaps. We cling to our high ground, our moral stance against "cheating" or taking a shortcut. We judge the very idea of a Compound V. But isn't that a luxury of safety? When you’re truly powerless against a threat, the line between right and necessary gets blurry.

I’m not saying we should all go out and find our own version of the serum. But this show held up a dark mirror to my own hypocrisy. It’s easy to be moral when you’re comfortable. The real test is what you’re willing to do—what rules you’re willing to re-examine—when you’re backed into a corner. Maybe the first step isn't gaining power, but being brutally honest about why we’re so quick to condemn it in others, while wishing we had a little more of it ourselves.
