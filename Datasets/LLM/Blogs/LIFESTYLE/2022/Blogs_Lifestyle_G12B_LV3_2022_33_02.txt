## The 700 Credit Score Hurdle: Is This Really How We Find a Home?

Okay, friends, let's talk about something that's been seriously stressing me out lately: the NYC apartment hunt. Specifically, this creeping, almost absurd requirement popping up everywhere – a 700 credit score. Seriously? 

I saw a post on Reddit the other day that just *resonated*. Someone perfectly articulated the frustration so many of us are feeling. It’s 2022, and we’re told to build credit, save money, and pull ourselves up by our bootstraps… but then slammed with a credit score gatekeeper that feels completely out of reach for so many. 

Does a 700 score *really* predict if I’ll pay my rent on time? Or does it just reflect a history of having access to credit in the first place? I’m starting to wonder if this isn’t just another layer of financial discrimination, making an already tough housing market even tougher. 

I’m not saying credit isn’t important, but shouldn’t landlords be looking at income, references, and overall responsibility? Finding a place to live shouldn’t feel like passing some arbitrary financial test. It should feel like finding a home.
