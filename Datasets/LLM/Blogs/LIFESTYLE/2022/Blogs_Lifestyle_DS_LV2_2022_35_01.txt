The first time I stood on my new Ohio River dock, rod in hand, I felt a mix of excitement and intimidation. The water churned, carrying branches and leaves past at a dizzying speed. My old lake rigs were useless here. After a few fruitless hours, a seasoned local ambled over. "You're thinking too hard," he smiled, suggesting a simple bottom rig with lively minnows. It wasn't just about the bait; it was about learning to read the river's rhythm. That first feisty smallmouth bass taught me more about adapting to new currents in life than any river ever could.
