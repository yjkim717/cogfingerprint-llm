**Chasing a Little Sun Inside**

It’s funny, isn’t it? As winter really tightened its grip in 2022, I found myself utterly obsessed with my pepper plants.  I’m a terrible gardener, really, but the thought of those little green guys shivering indoors felt…wrong.  Limited heating meant I was desperately researching ways to create a warmer microclimate – anything to coax a bit of summer into my kitchen. It’s a quiet, hopeful project, really, a little act of defiance against the gloom.  Maybe it’s about more than just peppers, though.  Maybe it’s about finding warmth and growth where you can.
