Living with bipolar means riding waves others can’t see. In 2022, I’d try to explain my mood swings to friends, only to be met with well-meaning but blank stares. That’s when the real loneliness hits—being in a crowded room but feeling completely isolated. My medication keeps me stable, but it can’t bridge that gap in understanding. It’s a quiet, personal journey, learning to find peace within when the world outside just doesn’t get it.
