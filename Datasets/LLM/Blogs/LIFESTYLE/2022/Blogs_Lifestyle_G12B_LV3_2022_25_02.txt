## Bending Reality (and Rubber): A Late-Night Anime Revelation

Okay, so hear me out. Last night, I was deep down a *One Piece* rabbit hole (as one does in 2022, right?), and a really fascinating discussion popped up on Reddit. It centered around Luffy, the main character, and his seemingly impossible feats. 

For years, we’ve accepted that Luffy's a rubber man. But the recent revelations about his connection to the Nika fruit – and that he embodies the *properties* of rubber, not *being* rubber – got me thinking. How *did* he physically affect Enel in that Skypeia arc? 

It's a tiny detail, but it sparked a bigger thought: sometimes our understanding of how things work needs a major shift. Like, maybe our rigid routines aren't working, and we need to embrace the "properties" of flexibility to truly thrive. Food for thought, right?
