As I tinkered with my 3D printer in 2022, I realized my trusty Fystec bed had seen better days - it had developed a frustrating bend. I'm now on the hunt for a reliable replacement, specifically a 355x355mm textured PEI Springsteel Bed. A smooth printing surface is not just about tech; it's about the joy of creating something with your own hands. A good bed can make all the difference in bringing your ideas to life.
