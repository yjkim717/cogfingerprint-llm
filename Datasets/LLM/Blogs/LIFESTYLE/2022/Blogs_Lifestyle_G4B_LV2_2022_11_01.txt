**The Day My Computer Broke (And Why It Matters)**

It’s funny how little things can suddenly feel *huge*. Last fall, I was happily working on my laptop – a perfectly decent OpenSUSE Leap, mind you – when suddenly, everything just…stopped. Firefox froze, and then the whole system locked up. A full power cycle was the only solution. 

It sounds small, I know. But that moment – the frustration, the feeling of being completely stuck – really made me think about my reliance on technology. We build these intricate digital worlds, and when they crumble, it’s a surprisingly jarring reminder of our connection to the physical. 

It's a good reminder to step back, breathe, and appreciate the simple act of turning off a computer sometimes.  Anyone else have a tech-related meltdown recently?
