### The Myth of the Perfect Routine

It’s 2022, and my Genki textbook is judging me from the shelf. For months, my routine was flawless: morning coffee, 30 minutes of hiragana drills, a chapter review. I had the apps, the tutor, the whole production. I was doing everything "right."

But I hit a wall. The squiggly characters I practiced so diligently one day would vanish from my brain the next. I could ace a quiz for my tutor, yet couldn’t string a simple sentence together when I needed it. The motivation that once fueled my 6 AM study sessions was gone, replaced by a dull sense of obligation. I was putting in the time, but the language just wasn't sticking.

I realized I’d become a hamster on a wheel, mistaking motion for progress. I was so focused on the routine itself—checking the boxes—that I’d forgotten the joy of discovery. The goal wasn't to perfectly execute a study plan; it was to connect with a culture I loved.

So, I’m trying something new. I’m putting the textbook down more often. I’m watching silly variety shows without subtitles and trying to cook from Japanese recipes. It’s messy and I understand maybe 10%, but it feels alive. Sometimes, the most productive thing you can do for your goals is to step away from the plan and just remember why you started.
