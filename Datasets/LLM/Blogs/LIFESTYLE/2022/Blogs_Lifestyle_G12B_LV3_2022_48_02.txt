## The Long Search and the Question of Letting Go

Remember 2022? The real estate market felt… chaotic, right? I certainly do. I spent three years searching for a home, stubbornly going it alone. Open houses became a weekend ritual, a blur of staged furniture and hopeful whispers. But after countless viewings and frustrating bidding wars, I started to wonder: was my independent spirit worth the struggle?

It got me thinking about relationships in general, really. How long do you invest in something – a friendship, a project, even a professional partnership – before re-evaluating if it's still serving you? Maybe a buyer's agent *would* have streamlined the process. Maybe it’s okay to admit that sometimes, a little help isn’t a sign of weakness, but a smart strategy. It’s a lesson I'm still pondering, even with keys in hand.
