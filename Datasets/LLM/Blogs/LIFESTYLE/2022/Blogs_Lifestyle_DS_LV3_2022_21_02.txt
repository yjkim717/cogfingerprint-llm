As I settle in with my evening tea, I find myself wondering what’s next for my favorite podcast. Will it be the intrigue of *Andor* or the fiery drama of *House of the Dragon*? It’s funny how these weekly recaps, a small ritual since the *Game of Thrones* days, have become a comforting part of my routine. Supporting them on Patreon feels like being part of a little community, eagerly awaiting the next shared story.
