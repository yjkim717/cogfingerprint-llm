As I ponder upgrading to an Apple Watch, I'm torn between its sleek features and a simpler, more affordable watch. I want to track my sleep patterns, but will a smartwatch really give me better insights than a dedicated device? I'm drawn to the convenience, but hesitant to trade style for functionality. Is the Apple Watch worth the investment, or should I stick with what I know?
