**Finding Joy in the Pause**

2022 felt…full. A lot of noise, a lot of striving. But this past weekend, something shifted. I finally finished a piece I’d been chipping away at for months – a little blog post, actually – and it felt incredible. It wasn’t about the post itself, though. It was about the *sober* way I approached it. 

Celebrating this small victory with my family was pure gold. We laughed, we connected, and honestly, it reminded me how powerfully creativity can flourish when we’re not chasing dopamine.  Sharing this journey with my community has been unexpectedly supportive too.  It’s a beautiful reminder that celebrating our wins, big or small, while staying grounded feels truly liberating.  What sober accomplishments are you celebrating lately?
