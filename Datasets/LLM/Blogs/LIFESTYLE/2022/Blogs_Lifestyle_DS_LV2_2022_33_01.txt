It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my carefully planned FODMAP meal, feeling utterly defeated. I started this diet hoping for relief from my IBS-D, but the severe cramping hasn’t let up. It’s discouraging when you’re doing “everything right” and your stomach still feels like a battlefield. I’m trying to hold onto hope, maybe adding in some probiotics next. To anyone else in this boat, you’re not alone. Some days are just about getting through, one breath at a time. We’ll find what works.
