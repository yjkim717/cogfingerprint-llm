## The Balancing Act: Ultrarunning, Work, and the Constant Shuffle

It's 2022, and if you’re anything like me, your life feels like a beautifully chaotic juggling act. I’m an ultrarunner, which means my weekends often involve pushing my body across trails for distances that most people wouldn't even consider a long run. But I'm also staring down a demanding career that frequently throws me onto a plane, sometimes for weeks at a time. 

Honestly? It's tough. Really tough.

There was a point earlier this year where I felt completely defeated. I’d just finished a brutal 50-miler, feeling on top of the world, and then *bam* – a month-long work trip to Europe. Suddenly, my meticulously planned training schedule was a distant memory, replaced by airport terminals and hotel gyms. I felt guilty for not logging miles, frustrated with my lack of control, and, if I'm being honest, a little lost.

I started questioning everything. Was it even possible to pursue my passion for ultrarunning while navigating this level of work commitment? Was I spreading myself too thin? The internal monologue was relentless.

What I’ve slowly realized, though, is that "balance" isn't about perfectly equal distribution. It's more about finding moments of flow, of connection, even amidst the chaos.  It’s about accepting that some weeks will be all about work, and others will be dedicated to pounding the trails.

I’ve had to get creative. Airport runs have become a surprisingly meditative ritual. Hotel gyms, though not ideal, are better than nothing.  And I’ve learned to be incredibly intentional with my time when I *am* home – squeezing in those key workouts and prioritizing recovery.

It’s not perfect. There are days I miss, and races I have to adjust my goals for. But I'm learning to be kinder to myself, recognizing that consistency doesn’t always mean a rigid schedule. It means showing up, in whatever capacity I can, to both my work and my running.

This year has been a reminder that life isn't a straight line. It’s a winding trail, full of unexpected turns and challenges. And sometimes, the most rewarding journeys are the ones where we learn to embrace the shuffle.
