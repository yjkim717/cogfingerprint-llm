**The Worrying Whimper of a Lost Friend**

It’s funny how a small thing – a lost dog – can suddenly trigger a wave of empathy. I saw a post on Reddit about a corgi mix, collarless and wandering near Shands on the University of Florida campus. It reminded me of a time my own pup went missing. That frantic searching, the desperate hope… it’s a feeling that stays with you. 

I wonder about this dog, and the person who might be missing him.  It’s a quiet reminder that even in a busy world, a little kindness and a watchful eye can make all the difference.  Let’s hope someone spots him and brings him home safe.
