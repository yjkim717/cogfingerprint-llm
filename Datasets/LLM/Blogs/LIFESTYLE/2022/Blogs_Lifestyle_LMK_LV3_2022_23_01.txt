As I navigated my last semester at the University of Florida in 2022, I found myself juggling a challenging course load with two jobs. I was determined to strike a balance between academics, work, and personal life. It wasn't easy, but I learned to prioritize my tasks, set realistic goals, and make time for self-care. By doing so, I was able to manage my coursework, excel in my jobs, and still enjoy my final semester. It was a valuable lesson in maintaining a healthy work-life balance that I'll carry with me beyond graduation.
