As I sat at my desk in 2022, juggling multiple projects, I realized my coding life was a mess. I was torn between GUI libraries for my next project. Should I opt for the familiarity of Win32 API on Windows, or explore the sleekness of AppKit API on macOS? And what about Linux - was GTK4 with Adwaita the way to go? I longed for a seamless Rust binding to tie it all together. My search for the perfect GUI library had become a lifestyle, consuming my every waking thought. Was there a simpler way to create cross-platform magic?
