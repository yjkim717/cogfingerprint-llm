It’s 2022, and I thought my stomach problems were finally over when my doctor suggested the low FODMAP diet. But here I am, weeks in, still doubled over with cramps. My IBS-D flare-ups haven’t eased up, and honestly, it’s disheartening. I’m trying to stay hopeful—maybe adding probiotics or tweaking my approach will help. For now, I’m leaning on my medical team and reminding myself that healing isn’t always a straight line. Some days are just about getting through.
