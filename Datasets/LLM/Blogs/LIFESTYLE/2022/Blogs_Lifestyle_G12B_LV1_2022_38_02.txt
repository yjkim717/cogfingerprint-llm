## The Unexpected Pivot & a Year of Questioning

Okay, so here's the thing. For the past five years, my world revolved around lines of code. Software development was *it*. I loved the problem-solving, the constant learning, the satisfaction of building something functional. Then, 2022 hit, and suddenly, "it" felt… limiting. 

I found myself staring at my screen, not with excitement, but with a quiet restlessness. Was this all there was? The thought of dedicating another decade to this path felt heavy. So, I started asking questions. Big ones. About what I truly *wanted*, not just what I was *doing*. 

Now, I'm exploring something completely different – a potential return to education, maybe even a CS degree with an eye towards expanding my horizons internationally. It's daunting, honestly, but also… exhilarating. It’s a huge pivot, and I’m trying to embrace the uncertainty. More to come on this journey, I promise!
