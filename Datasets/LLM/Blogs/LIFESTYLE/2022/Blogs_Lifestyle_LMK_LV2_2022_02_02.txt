The Crypto Conundrum: Can I Really Live Off My Coins?

As I sat down to pay for my morning coffee with my cryptocurrency, a nagging thought crept in - am I using it as intended? Is it an investment, a long-term asset, or just a fancy way to buy my daily latte? The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I'm not alone in this dilemma. The rise of cryptocurrency has promised financial independence, but it's also created a sense of confusion. With stablecoins and other digital assets, the lines between investment and everyday spending are blurred. And then there's the taxman - every time I make a transaction, I'm potentially triggering a taxable event. As I sipped my coffee, I wondered, can I really live off my crypto? Or am I just holding onto it, hoping it'll grow in value? The truth is, I'm still figuring it out.
