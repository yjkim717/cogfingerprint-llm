As I navigated the 2022 real estate market, I faced a tough decision: pay a $345 rate lock extension fee or take a gamble on my loan rate staying the same. It was a stressful moment, but it made me realize how much I've grown as a real estate investor. I've learned to weigh the risks and make informed decisions. Now, I'm more confident in my ability to navigate the ups and downs of the market, and I'm excited to see what the future holds. The journey has taught me to be prepared for anything.
