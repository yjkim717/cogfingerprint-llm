**The Weight of a Shared Screenshot**

Remember 2022? Scrolling felt…different. It wasn't just entertainment; it was a landscape of constant connection, and sometimes, a troubling current. I found myself thinking a lot about something that felt both incredibly simple and deeply unsettling: the casual sharing of images online. 

It started with a friend sending a funny meme, then a picture of her dog, and before I knew it, the line blurred. Suddenly, the idea of someone – especially a young person – having an image of them, shared without consent, felt heavy. It’s easy to get caught up in the flow, the ‘everyone’s doing it’ mentality. But that’s precisely what makes it so dangerous. 

We talk about digital responsibility, about setting boundaries, but it’s a constant, quiet battle.  It’s about recognizing that a single screenshot can carry a huge weight, and that our actions, even seemingly small ones, contribute to a culture that needs serious re-evaluation.  Let’s be more mindful, more thoughtful, and always, always ask.
