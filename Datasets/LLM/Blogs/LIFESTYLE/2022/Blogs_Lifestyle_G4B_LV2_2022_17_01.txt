**The Ghosts of Failed Theory Tests**

2022 felt… significant. Not in a huge, life-altering way, but a quiet, persistent one. I was back at the wheel, or rather, staring at a theory test again. It’s funny, isn’t it? After a year of driving lessons, feeling relatively confident, and then… a setback. A failed theory test after a year of practice. 

It wasn’t just about the points; it was the little voice whispering doubts. It reminded me of how easily we can get bogged down in revisiting old anxieties. Like a ghost of a past attempt, it kept pulling me back to the start. 

Honestly, it was a good reminder that progress isn’t always a straight line. Sometimes, you need to revisit the basics, adjust your approach, and gently push past those nagging insecurities.  It’s about accepting the stumble and using it as fuel to keep moving forward.
