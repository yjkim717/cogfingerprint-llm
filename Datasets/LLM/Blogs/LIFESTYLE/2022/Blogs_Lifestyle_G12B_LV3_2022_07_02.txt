## Battling the Winter Chill: My Indoor Garden Adventure

Okay, real talk – winter gardening is *hard*. I’m a newbie veggie grower, and this year, I decided to keep my beloved pepper and tomato plants going indoors through the chilly 2022 months. My house isn’t exactly a tropical paradise, though! We keep the thermostat pretty low to save on heating. 

Thankfully, I have grow lights and supports already set up, but keeping these guys warm enough has been a challenge. I’ve been researching affordable heating solutions – bubble wrap greenhouses, anyone? – and it's a surprisingly rewarding puzzle. It’s a little slice of summer defiance against the winter gloom, and honestly, a lesson in resourcefulness!
