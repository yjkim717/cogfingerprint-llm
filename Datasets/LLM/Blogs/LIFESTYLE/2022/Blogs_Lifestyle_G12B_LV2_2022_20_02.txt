## The Unexpected Joy of Letting Go (and Helping Others!)

Remember that closet overflowing with clothes you haven't worn in years? I finally tackled mine last month! Donating to a local thrift store – specifically, Unique Thrift – felt surprisingly good. Knowing those forgotten pieces might bring joy (and a great deal!) to someone else? That’s a win-win, especially heading into 2023. Anyone else finding joy in decluttering?
