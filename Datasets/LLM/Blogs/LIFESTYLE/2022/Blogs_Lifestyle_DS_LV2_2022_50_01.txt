It’s 2022, and I’m trying to assemble the pieces of my life like a messy bit of code. Sometimes, I push too much into my mental registers—work, news, endless scrolling—and bam, a core-dumped feeling hits. I’m left staring at a blank screen, wondering where I segfaulted. Maybe it’s time to debug my routines, clear the cache, and run a simpler, more mindful program. Anyone else feeling this?
