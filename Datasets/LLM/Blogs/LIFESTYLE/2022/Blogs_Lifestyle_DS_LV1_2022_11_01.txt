It happened again this morning. A fresh start, a hot coffee, and a click on the Firefox icon. Instead of my homepage, the screen seized into a frozen mosaic of pixels. My entire openSUSE system, locked solid. The only fix? The dreaded power cycle.

It’s a strange, modern frustration. In 2022, we expect seamless tech, yet a simple action can bring everything to a grinding halt. It got me thinking about my own life. How often do I force a start, rushing into my day without letting my own system—my mind—properly boot up? That frantic energy creates its own kind of internal freeze.

Now, I give myself five quiet minutes after "waking up." No emails, no news, just sipping my coffee and letting the resolution of my thoughts settle. It’s the gentlest reboot, and it prevents a total system crash by lunchtime.
