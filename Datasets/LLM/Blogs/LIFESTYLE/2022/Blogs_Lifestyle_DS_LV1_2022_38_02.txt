**The Unplanned Path to My Master's**

It was late 2022, and I was a freshly minted software engineer, staring at a screen filled with browser tabs. "Top Universities for CS," "GRE vs. GMAT," "Scholarships in Germany." The dream of studying abroad felt less like an adventure and more like a complex algorithm I couldn't debug.

I was so focused on the perfect plan—the right country, the highest test score—that I was paralyzed. The turning point came when I stopped treating it like a coding problem and started treating it like a journey. I reached out to a professor in Canada on a whim, and her encouraging reply changed everything. It reminded me that sometimes, the most elegant solutions aren't meticulously planned; they're discovered through a bit of courage and a willingness to click "send." My path forward was no longer a spreadsheet, but a story waiting to be written.
