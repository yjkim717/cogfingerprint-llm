**Island Dreams & Midwest Realities**

Okay, deep breath. The Galapagos… seriously, it’s still swirling around in my head. Turquoise water, blue-footed boobies, volcanic landscapes – it felt like stepping onto another planet. It was, undeniably, an investment, a splurge I’ll cherish forever. 

But as 2022 winds down, I’m starting to think about what’s next.  Part of me desperately wants to chase that same feeling of wildness, maybe even plan another international escape.  Yet, there’s this quiet pull towards something… simpler. 

I’ve been daydreaming about a road trip across the Midwest. Hiking in state parks, kayaking on the Great Lakes, maybe even trying some serious stargazing away from city lights. It feels like a grounding counterpoint to the extravagance of the Galapagos.  Maybe a good dose of Midwestern outdoor adventure is exactly what I need to reset and appreciate the beauty right here at home. What do you think?
