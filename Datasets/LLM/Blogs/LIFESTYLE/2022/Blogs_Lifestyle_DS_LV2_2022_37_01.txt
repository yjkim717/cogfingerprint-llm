It’s funny how the soundtrack of your life shifts with time. In 2022, I found myself diving back into the world of My Chemical Romance, a band that defined my teenage angst. I spent hours hunting down their best interviews, from *The Black Parade* tour era to the raw honesty of *Life on the Murder Scene*. It was like catching up with old, slightly dramatic friends.

What struck me most was how my "favorite member" had changed over the years. It wasn't just about who had the coolest hair anymore; it was about whose story resonated with where I was in my own life. Revisiting those interviews felt like a form of self-reflection, a reminder that our heroes—and our tastes—evolve right along with us. Funny how a band can help you see your own growth.
