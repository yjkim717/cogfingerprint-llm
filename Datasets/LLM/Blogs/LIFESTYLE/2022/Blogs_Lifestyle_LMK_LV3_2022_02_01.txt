Administering medicine to a tiny human who can't even comprehend the importance of it is a daunting task. The struggle is real, and I'm not alone in this.

The medication, meant to heal, tastes like a toxic concoction that makes my baby gag. The tears, the tantrums, the desperation â€“ it's a vicious cycle.

The frustration is palpable, and I'm left wondering if there's a better way.

In this chaotic world of parenting, it's the little things that can become monumental challenges. Administering medicine is just one of them. But it's in these moments that we, as parents, discover our strength and resilience. So, to those who are fighting the same battle, I see you.
