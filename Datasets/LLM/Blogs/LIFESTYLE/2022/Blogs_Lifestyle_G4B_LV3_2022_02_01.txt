**The Tiny Battle and the Weight of Worry**

2022 felt…intense. Not in a grand, world-changing way, but in the quiet, relentless pressure of caring for a brand new baby. And let me tell you, those first few weeks of battling a nasty illness were a masterclass in frustration. We were practically drowning in bottles and fever checks, desperately trying to get our little one to swallow those antibiotics.

It wasn't just the physical exhaustion – though that was a huge part of it. It was the feeling of being utterly helpless, watching our baby struggle and feeling like we were failing to protect them. The constant resistance to the medication, the worried faces of the pediatrician, it all piled up. 

Honestly, there were moments I just wanted to curl up and hide. But then, a tiny smile, a fleeting moment of comfort, would remind me why we were fighting. It’s a strange thing, parenthood – a beautiful, messy battle fought with love and a whole lot of worry.  It underscored how incredibly vulnerable we are, and how fiercely protective we become.
