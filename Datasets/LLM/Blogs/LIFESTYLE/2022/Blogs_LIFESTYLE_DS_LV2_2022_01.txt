It’s Talent Tuesday again, and I’m sitting here thinking about how much has changed since I got sober. Back in 2022, I never imagined my life would revolve around creating—not just staying sober, but actually building something meaningful. I used to think my talent was buried under all those years of numbing out, but this sober community showed me otherwise.

Every week, we share what we’ve made: poems, paintings, even a perfectly baked loaf of bread. It’s not about being the best; it’s about showing up, sober and present. Creating something has become my anchor, a quiet rebellion against the chaos I left behind. Who knew that staying sober could feel so much like coming alive?
