**Saltwater Ghosts & Broken Rods**

It’s funny how a single day can feel like a whole chapter of your life, isn’t it? Last fall, 2022, I was down at the Bob Sikes Cut – that notorious channel where the sounds of Pensacola Bay meet the Gulf – trying my hand at surf fishing. I’d been tossing out sp minnows, hoping for a redfish or maybe even a snook. 

Then *it* hit. A surge, a pull, and suddenly my rod was screaming. It was a monster, honestly. I couldn’t even get a good look at it, just felt the power and the fight.  And then, predictably, the rod buckled. A bob Sikes cut – a nasty crack right through the blank. 

It wasn’t about the fish, though. It was about that raw, visceral connection to the water, the humbling reminder of nature’s strength, and the frustrating beauty of equipment failure. Sometimes, the best catches are the ones that slip away, leaving you with a story and a slightly broken rod.
