As I binge-watched House of the Dragon, I couldn't help but think about the shows that sparked my fandom. Just like the Star Wars series recaps on Patreon, this Game of Thrones prequel has me hooked. I'm curious - what's next? Will the next epic fantasy series get the same recap treatment? For fans like me, a new recap series would be a thrilling way to dive deeper into our favorite stories.
