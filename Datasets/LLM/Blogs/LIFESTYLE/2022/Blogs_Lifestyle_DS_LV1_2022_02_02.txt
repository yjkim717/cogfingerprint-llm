It’s 2022, and I’ll admit—I got swept up in the crypto hype. For a while, I genuinely believed my digital wallet was a ticket to financial freedom. I’d refresh my portfolio first thing in the morning, dreaming of early retirement.

But then I tried actually *using* it. I bought a coffee with Bitcoin, feeling like a futuristic pioneer. A week later, I did the math: that latte effectively cost me triple thanks to a price surge. My futuristic payment felt more like a penalty.

Suddenly, the contradiction hit me. How can something be a reliable way to buy groceries when its value swings wildly overnight? Every transaction became a taxable event, a mini financial decision. I realized I was treating my spending like a stock trade—hardly the simple path to independence I’d imagined.

Now, I keep a little in stablecoins for clarity, but my main takeaway? True financial freedom isn’t just about accumulating assets—it’s about predictability. Money should help you live, not keep you guessing.
