It’s 2022, and I’ve hit that stage in life—presbyopia is real. As a longtime contact lens wearer, I dreaded switching to clunky reading glasses. But then I discovered multifocal contacts, and wow, what a game-changer! No more fumbling for specs to read a menu or my phone. Hearing others share their success stories in online forums sealed the deal. It’s not just about seeing clearly anymore; it’s about living smoothly, without missing a beat.
