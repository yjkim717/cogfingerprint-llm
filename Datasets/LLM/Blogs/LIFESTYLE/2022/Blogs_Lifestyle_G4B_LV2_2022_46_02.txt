**The Unexpected Pause Button**

2022 felt like a year of building – not just physical things, but also… myself. I dove headfirst into 3D printing, specifically with Klipper. There’s something incredibly satisfying about watching a digital design materialize layer by layer. But I hit a snag.  The pauses! Sometimes, a print would halt, and I’d stare, wondering what was up. 

That’s when I started tinkering with SuperSlicer, experimenting with how the printer could *signal* a pause and invite my intervention. It’s a small thing, really, but it felt like a gentle reminder to slow down, to check in, and to truly be present with the process.  A little pause button in a world that demands constant speed.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
