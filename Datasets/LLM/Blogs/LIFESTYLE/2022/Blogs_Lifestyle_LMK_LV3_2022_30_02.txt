As I considered buying an Apple Watch in 2022, I wondered: can a smartwatch really track sleep effectively? Or should I stick with a basic watch or invest in a dedicated sleep tracker? I'm not alone in seeking better sleep quality. With the rise of fitness trackers, it's clear we're prioritizing our well-being. I'll be exploring the Apple Watch's sleep tracking feature and whether it's the right tool for a restful night's sleep.
