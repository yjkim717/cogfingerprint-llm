### The Digital Talk We Can't Afford to Skip

Remember the “big talk” our parents gave us? For me, it was about looking both ways before crossing the street. It felt like the most important rule in the world.

Now, as a parent myself in 2022, the street I’m worried about is the digital one my kids navigate on their phones. We’ve had the stranger-danger chats, but recently, a news story about teens and sexting chilled me to the bone. It wasn’t just about social drama; it was about kids, good kids from loving homes, accidentally creating what the law defines as child pornography.

My heart just sank. I realized my "online safety" talks were outdated. It’s not just about privacy settings or not talking to strangers. It’s about having the uncomfortable, crucial conversation about the permanent, legal firestorm a single impulsive click can create—even between two young people who think they’re in love.

The world has changed. Our conversations have to change with it. This isn’t about mistrust; it’s about arming them with knowledge to protect their entire future.
