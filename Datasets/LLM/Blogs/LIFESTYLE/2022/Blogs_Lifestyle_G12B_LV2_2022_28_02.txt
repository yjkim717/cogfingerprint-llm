## The Never-Ending Quest for a Clean Bathroom (and Happy Roomba!)

Okay, real talk: adulting is mostly just searching for the *right* things. Right now? It's a washable bath mat. Seriously! Iâ€™ve battled shedding microfiber and a Roomba that hates latex. It feels silly, but a little bathroom peace? Worth the online deep dive. Anyone else on this quest in 2022? Send help (and recommendations!).
