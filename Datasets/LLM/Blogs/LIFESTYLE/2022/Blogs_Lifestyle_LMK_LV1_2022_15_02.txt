As we navigate the complexities of our digital lives in 2022, it's essential to have open and honest conversations with our kids about online safety. The temptation to explore and express their identity through sharing explicit images can be overwhelming, but the consequences are severe. Sexting, in particular, is a serious issue that can have long-lasting effects on a minor's life. Not only can it lead to arrest and prosecution, but it can also result in being registered as a sex offender. As a society, we need to take a step back and consider the impact of our actions online. Let's take a moment to reflect on our own digital footprint and have those crucial conversations with our loved ones. By doing so, we can work together to create a safer and more responsible online community for everyone.
