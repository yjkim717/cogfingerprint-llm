There’s something about the stillness of a Midwest trail in late 2022 that feels like a deep, calming breath for the soul. After years of dreaming of far-flung international escapes, I found myself drawn closer to home this autumn. Maybe it’s a post-pandemic shift, a craving for simplicity over spectacle.

Instead of navigating foreign transit maps, I was tracing the path of a winding river in a Wisconsin state park. The crunch of leaves underfoot, the crisp air filling my lungs—it was a different kind of adventure, one of quiet rediscovery. I realized the grandeur I was seeking wasn’t just in passport stamps, but in the golden-hour light filtering through the pine trees right in my own backyard. Sometimes, the most profound journeys don’t require a plane ticket at all.
