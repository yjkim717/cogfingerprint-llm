It’s my last semester at UF, and I’m staring down EEL3872 and ALS3200C like two mountains I have to climb—while juggling two part-time jobs. In 2022, the workload feels relentless, and I’m learning that balance isn’t about doing it all perfectly, but about giving myself grace on the tough days. Some nights, it’s just me, coffee, and a mountain of assignments, but I keep reminding myself: this hustle is temporary, and the finish line is closer than it seems.
