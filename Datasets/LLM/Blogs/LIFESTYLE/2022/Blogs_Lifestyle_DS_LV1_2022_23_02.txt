It’s funny how a single moment can shift your whole day. Last Tuesday, rushing to my psych class near Shands, I spotted a little corgi mix trotting alone—no collar, no owner in sight. My frantic schedule suddenly felt trivial. I spent the next hour quietly guiding him toward safety, a small act that grounded me in the present. In our fast-paced 2022 lives, it’s these unexpected pauses—these chances to help and connect—that remind me what truly matters. Sometimes, the universe sends a lost dog to help us find ourselves.
