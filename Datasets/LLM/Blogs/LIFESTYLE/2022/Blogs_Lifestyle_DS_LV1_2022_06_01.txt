There I was, mid-flight in 2022, sipping my third glass of wine courtesy of JetBlue’s distracted flight attendant. It got me thinking—how often do we glide through life on uncharged moments? Sometimes the real luxury isn’t the free drink, but the quiet grace of things left unaccounted for. Cheers to that.
