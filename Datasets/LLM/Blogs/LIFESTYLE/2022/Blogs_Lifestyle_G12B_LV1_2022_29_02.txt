## The Quiet Space Between

It’s funny, isn't it? Living with bipolar, you’re told to build a support system. But sometimes, explaining the rollercoaster to friends just…widens the gap. Last week, a conversation about my medication felt like a lecture, not a connection. It left me feeling even more alone.

It’s 2022, and I’m realizing connection isn’t always about sharing *everything*. Right now, I’m prioritizing quiet moments, nurturing the friendships that feel safe, and fiercely protecting that space within myself. Maybe that's enough for now, and a whole lot healthier.
