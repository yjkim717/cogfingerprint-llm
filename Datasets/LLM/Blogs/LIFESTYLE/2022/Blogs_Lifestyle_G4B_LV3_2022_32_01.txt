**The Year I Stopped Buying Jarred Everything**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of small, intentional shifts. I realized I was spending a *lot* of time – and money – on pre-made sauces and pickles. There’s something comforting about a good jarred salsa, sure, but it always felt… fleeting. 

I started experimenting with making my own.  It’s been surprisingly rewarding. Now, I'm happily stocking my fridge with vibrant homemade sauces, knowing they’ll deliver a burst of fresh flavor for months to come. It’s not just about the taste, though; it’s about slowing down, connecting with the process, and building a little bit of resilience into my week.  Plus, a long-lasting sauce feels like a tiny victory against the chaos of 2022! What little habits have you been building?
