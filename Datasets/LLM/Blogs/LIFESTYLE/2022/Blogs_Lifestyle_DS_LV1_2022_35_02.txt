There I was, the last golden hour of 2022 fading over the Atlantic, the SP Minnow dancing in the surf. The braid went tight, the rod arched, and my heart hammered against my ribs—a real fish. Then, a sickening slack. The line had parted at the clinch knot, a connection I’d tied a thousand times without a second thought.

Walking back to the car, the fish wasn’t the only thing that got away. I’d been so focused on the gear—the perfect lure, the strong braid—that I’d neglected the simple, essential link holding it all together. It’s a feeling that echoes beyond the shoreline, doesn’t it? We chase the big, flashy goals, the "lures" of life, while the foundational habits and quiet connections—the daily "knots"—fray from inattention. That lost fish was a 2022 lesson I’m carrying forward: mastery isn't about the grand gesture, but the integrity of the small, crucial things we do on autopilot. It’s in the details that we find our true strength.
