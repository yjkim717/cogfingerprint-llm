**The Sunday Reset**

It’s funny how we get so caught up in the *doing* of life, isn’t it? Work, errands, social media… it all feels urgent. But lately, I’ve been craving a different kind of urgency – the kind that comes with a really thorough reset. 

This past weekend, I spent a ridiculous amount of time fiddling with my computer, actually. I’d cloned my SSD – a slightly panicked attempt to speed up my aging machine – and it was stubbornly slow booting. Diving into the BIOS, tweaking boot priorities, and generally feeling like a tech support newbie. 

It reminded me of needing to re-evaluate my own routines. Sometimes, you’re just running on autopilot, prioritizing everything *but* the things that genuinely recharge you. Like a fresh OS, a clean slate can be surprisingly powerful.  Maybe this weekend, I’ll focus less on conquering to-do lists and more on just...being.  Anyone else feel that pull to just *reset* sometimes?
