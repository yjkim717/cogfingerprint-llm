It was supposed to be my perfect 2022 escape: a quiet evening, my favorite PC game, and my new PS5 controller. But every time I leaned back or shifted in my chair, the screen would freeze. My digital world just… stopped.

I felt like I was in a tech thriller. Was my own movement the villain? After some frantic googling, I found the culprit: the controller’s hyper-sensitive motion sensor. It was trying to interpret my simple, human fidgeting as a complex game command.

It made me think. How often do the very tools designed for our convenience end up complicating our lives? That night, my quest for a simple solution became a small lesson in modern living—sometimes, you have to turn off the “smart” features to actually enjoy the moment.
