**The Ghost in the Controller**

It’s funny how technology can sometimes feel…off. Last year, I was completely hooked on Elden Ring, and I finally caved and got a PS5. The motion sensor seemed like such a cool idea – imagining casting spells with a wave of my hand! But then I started getting this bizarre lag, especially when using the controller with the sensor. 

It wasn’t just a stutter; it felt like a ghost was messing with the game. Like my inputs weren't quite reaching the screen.  It was frustrating, and a little unsettling. It made me realize how reliant we’ve become on seamless experiences, and how easily a small glitch can completely derail the immersion.  Sometimes, a little imperfection is a reminder to just breathe and enjoy the journey, right?
