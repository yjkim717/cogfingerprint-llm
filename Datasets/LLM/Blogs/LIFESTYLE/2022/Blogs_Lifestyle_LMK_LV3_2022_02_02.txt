The promise of cryptocurrency - a new, decentralized way to make payments and invest our money. But as we navigate this rapidly evolving landscape in 2022, it's hard not to wonder: are cryptocurrencies truly cut out for everyday transactions? As someone who's been following the space, I'm increasingly skeptical.

The main issue is volatility. One day, the value of your cryptocurrency is skyrocketing; the next, it's plummeting. It's a rollercoaster that's more suited to investors looking to make a quick profit than to people trying to buy their morning coffee. And yet, isn't the whole point of currency to be a stable store of value?

Moreover, the investment nature of cryptocurrencies is at odds with their potential use as a payment method. We're more likely to hoard our crypto assets in the hopes they'll appreciate in value than to spend them on everyday items. The rise of stablecoins has attempted to address this issue, but it's hard to shake the feeling that they're just a band-aid on a larger problem.

As we consider the valuation of cryptocurrencies, it's worth asking: what are we really trying to achieve here? Are we looking to create a new way to invest and potentially get rich, or are we trying to revolutionize the way we make everyday payments? Perhaps it's time to take a step back and reevaluate our expectations.
