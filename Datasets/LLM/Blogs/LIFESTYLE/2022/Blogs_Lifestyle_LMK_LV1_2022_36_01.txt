"My trusty Galaxy S9 had a mind of its own! Out of the blue, it auto-rebooted and performed a factory reset, wiping all my app data. I was left staring at a blank screen, forced to set up my phone from scratch. It was a frustrating reset, but it also made me realize how dependent I'd become on my device. Now, I'm trying to strike a better balance between tech and real life - a digital detox, of sorts."
