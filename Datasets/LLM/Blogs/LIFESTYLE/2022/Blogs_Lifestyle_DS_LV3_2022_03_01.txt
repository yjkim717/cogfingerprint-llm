### The Road to Myself: Finding Sobriety and Safety in a Van

It’s funny how the biggest transformations often start with a single, quiet decision. For me, that decision was to stop drinking. It wasn’t a dramatic, rock-bottom moment filmed for television; it was a weary, early-morning realization in my cramped apartment that the life I was living was no longer sustainable. The noise in my head was deafening, and the four walls I’d called home felt more like a cage for a person I was pretending to be.

In the fragile, clear-headed space of early sobriety in 2022, a new kind of restlessness set in. It wasn’t the anxious kind I used to numb with a bottle; it was a deep, primal yearning for *movement*. I stumbled upon the #vanlife community online, and something clicked. It wasn't just the stunning sunsets and cozy interiors—it was the promise of minimalism. The idea of owning less, so I could *be* more. It felt like the physical manifestation of what I was trying to do internally: strip away the excess, the clutter, the performative layers, and finally meet myself.

But as a trans woman, my daydreams were quickly tempered by a very real, chilling fear: safety. The open road isn’t always a welcoming place for someone like me. The romanticized freedom of vanlife is a privilege not everyone enjoys equally. My vision wasn’t just about finding beautiful campsites; it was about finding safe ones. It was about creating a mobile sanctuary, a tiny home on wheels where I could finally exhale and be utterly, completely myself, without apology.

So, I got to work. My budget was tight, a direct result of prioritizing my health over my old career. I bought a used, high-top Ford Transit van—dented, a little rusty, but mechanically sound. It was a blank, metal canvas. The conversion process became my therapy. With every sheet of plywood I measured and every screw I drove, I was building not just a living space, but a new foundation for my life.

Minimalism wasn’t an aesthetic choice; it was a financial and practical necessity. I learned the weight of everything. A heavy cast-iron pan might be a dream for some, but for me, it was precious cargo space and fuel economy. I prioritized a robust power system over decorative trinkets—my laptop for work and my medical devices were non-negotiable. I insulated the van myself, stuffing fiberglass into crevices, my hands raw, my spirit determined. Sweat equity was the currency of my freedom. There were days I sobbed in frustration, tangled in 12-volt wiring, convinced I’d never get it right. But the clarity of sobriety gave me a patience I never knew I had. I’d walk away, breathe, and return to the problem until it was solved.

This is where remote work wove itself into the fabric of my new existence. My old job in an office was part of the persona I’d shed. I needed an income that could travel with me. I spent my evenings, after a day of construction, hunched over my laptop, teaching myself digital marketing. I landed a few freelance clients, building
