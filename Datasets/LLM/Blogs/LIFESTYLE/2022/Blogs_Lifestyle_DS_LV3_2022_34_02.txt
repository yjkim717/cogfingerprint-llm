It’s 2022, and I’m sitting at my kitchen table, staring at an email that should have been a breakthrough: a $285,000 government contract, ready for the taking. My heart raced, but my stomach sank. As a small business owner, I knew this wasn’t just about delivering a product—it was a cash flow puzzle.

My credit limit was a fraction of what I needed, and my vendors wanted payment upfront. Meanwhile, the government’s payment terms meant I’d be waiting months to see a dime. I felt stuck in a cycle, where opportunity knocked, but my finances held the door shut.

It’s in these moments you realize that business isn’t just about passion; it’s about navigating the gaps between ambition and reality. That contract wasn’t just a goal—it was a lesson in resilience.
