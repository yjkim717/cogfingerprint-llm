The other day, I found my twelve-year-old, Leo, curled in his favorite armchair, completely absorbed in sketching a fantastical dragon. The afternoon sun caught the intense focus on his face, a scene of quiet contentment. Yet, a familiar, quiet worry nudged at me. This was the third weekend in a row he’d declined an invitation—this time, a backyard birthday party for a kid he’s known since kindergarten.

Before 2020, our calendar was a mosaic of playdates and soccer practices. The pandemic didn’t just pause that; it seemingly rewired something in him. Where there was once a bustling, if small, circle of friends, there’s now a pronounced preference for solitude. His social withdrawal isn't sullen or angry; it’s a serene retreat into his own world of art and imagination.

As a parent, I’m caught in a daily tug-of-war. I see his artistic interests flourishing in this quiet, and a part of me wants to fiercely protect that space. He’s creating incredible things, building worlds on paper that are far more vivid than any video game. But another part fears this isolation, wondering if the gentle pull of the pandemic has become a permanent anchor.

So, we navigate this new terrain with soft steps. The big, noisy group activities are off the table for now. Instead, it’s a low-pressure offer: “Just you and Jake at the park for an hour?” Sometimes it’s a yes, often it’s a no. The challenge isn’t about forcing him back into his old mold, but about finding a new balance—accepting the wonderfully creative person he is becoming while leaving a light on at the door, just in case he decides to step back out into the world. It’s a lesson in trusting that his path, though different from what I pictured, is uniquely his own.
