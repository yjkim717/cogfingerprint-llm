"Finding Balance in the Dark: My Epic Seven Expedition Experience

As I navigated the Dark/Light Expedition event in Epic Seven this weekend, I couldn't help but reflect on the parallels between gaming and real life. My RGB team, comprising of characters with unique abilities, worked in harmony to overcome the challenges of the expedition. Meanwhile, my Dark team, led by Gigantus and Pherus Fire, required a different strategy altogether. It struck me that this mirrored my own approach to balancing different aspects of my lifestyle. Just as I needed to adapt my teams to succeed in the game, I've learned to juggle the light and dark aspects of my own life - work and play, productivity and relaxation. As I shared my teams with fellow gamers, I'm reminded that we're all on a similar journey, seeking balance and harmony in our own ways. What's your team composition for this event?"
