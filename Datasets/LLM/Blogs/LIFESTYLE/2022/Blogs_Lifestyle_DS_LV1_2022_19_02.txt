### The Great Car Seat Conundrum: Finding Our Family SUV

I’ll admit it—I had a vision. I pictured myself zipping around town in my sporty Mazda CX-5, the epitome of cool, modern parenthood. That fantasy lasted exactly one afternoon in the fall of 2022, the day we tried to install our new infant’s rear-facing car seat.

Suddenly, the passenger seat was shoved so far forward it was practically in the dashboard. My husband, who is not a giant, looked like a folded lawn chair. Our compact SUV, which had felt so spacious for two, had instantly transformed into a claustrophobic tin can.

That was the moment our car search truly began. Our new non-negotiable? Legroom. We weren't just looking for a vehicle anymore; we were looking for a mobile living room, a place where our family could grow without someone losing feeling in their legs. Our budget was firm—under $40k—but our need for space was absolute. The hunt was on for a true family vehicle, one where the car seat wouldn't feel like an unwelcome guest taking over the entire house. It was a humbling start to a new chapter, trading "sporty" for "sensible" in the name of baby-proofing our commute.
