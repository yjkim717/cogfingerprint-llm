It was a Tuesday in 2022, and I was drowning in tabs. My browser was a digital junkyard of news articles, shopping carts, and half-written emails. I felt busy, but I wasn’t productive. The constant stream of information wasn't empowering me; it was paralyzing me.

So, I decided to do a digital declutter. I started small, ruthlessly unsubscribing from newsletters I never read. Then, I turned off most of my phone’s notifications. The silence was jarring at first, but soon it became peaceful. The biggest change, however, was creating a "focus hour" each morning—no email, no social media, just one important task.

It wasn't about abandoning technology, but about curating it. By intentionally filtering out the noise, I found the signal. My mind felt less like a cluttered browser and more like a clean, well-organized workspace. The goal isn't to be offline, but to be present in your own life.
