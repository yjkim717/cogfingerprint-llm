>## The Weight of Predictions (and Pizza)

Remember 2022? The year everything felt… uncertain. I was knee-deep in A-Level applications, staring down the barrel of predicted grades. My teachers were generous, thankfully, but the thought of being boxed in by those numbers felt stifling. Would a predicted AAC limit my options? Would I be sacrificing my dreams for a safer choice? 

Honestly, a lot of it was fuelled by stress-induced pizza binges. It’s funny looking back – I obsessed over potential futures while simultaneously living in the present, fueled by carbs and anxiety. Ultimately, I learned to trust myself and my potential, regardless of what a piece of paper said. And, yes, I did end up eating a *lot* of pizza.
