**The Quest for Smooth (and a Little Peace of Mind)**

2022 felt like a year of small, consistent upgrades – mostly because my old shaver was *seriously* failing me.  I stumbled across a Reddit thread raving about a Wahl 5 Star Finale with an adjustable foil, and suddenly, a little grooming felt less like a chore and more like self-care.  It’s amazing how a simple tool can bring a bit of calm to the daily routine.  Anyone else find those little upgrades make a big difference?
