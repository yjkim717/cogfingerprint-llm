**The Quiet Shift: Watching My Son Retreat**

It feels like just yesterday we were all buzzing with the energy of 2022 – cautiously optimistic, finally emerging from the shadow of the pandemic. But lately, I’ve noticed a different kind of quiet in my 12-year-old son, Leo. He’s pulling back, a subtle social withdrawal that’s starting to worry me. 

It’s not just one thing, really. It’s a layering of things – the lingering effects of isolation, the constant ‘what-ifs’ about the world, and a growing sense of self-doubt that seems to cling to him. He used to *love* soccer and drawing, but now he’s hesitant to join in activities, preferring to just…watch. 

As a parent, it’s frustrating, of course. But more than that, it’s heartbreaking. It’s a reminder that growing up isn’t always about outward exuberance, but about navigating the quiet, internal battles we all face. I’m trying to be patient, offering a listening ear and gentle encouragement – hoping he’ll find his way back to the joy he once held so dear.
