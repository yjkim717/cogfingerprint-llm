**Lost in the Sands of Time (and a Really Good Game)**

2022 felt like a year of unexpected twists, didn’t it? I found myself craving a similar feeling, but in a completely different space – a strategy game, specifically. I was utterly engrossed in a historical simulation, building empires and navigating complex scenarios. 

Recently, a single, sudden event threw everything into chaos – a disruptive “scenario” that completely upended my carefully laid plans. It was a harsh reminder of how easily history can shift, how a single decision can ripple outwards. It made me think about how we try to control our own lives, and how much of it truly *is* within our grasp.  There’s a strange satisfaction in wanting a dominant, adversarial playstyle, isn’t there?  Almost like a challenge to the unpredictable nature of things.
