"As I prep for the Arizona bar exam in 2022, I'm considering a cost-effective route - buying used 2021 Barbri materials. Graduating law school in 2010, I'm a bit rusty, but determined. I've heard mixed reviews about used bar prep materials, so I'm seeking advice. Has anyone else taken this route? Were the outdated materials still helpful? I'm eager to hear from those who've been in my shoes and learn from their experiences."
