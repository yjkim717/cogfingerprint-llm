"Rethinking Health Insurance: Is the Grass Greener on the Other Side?

As I sat down to crunch the numbers for my family's health insurance, I couldn't help but wonder if our employer-sponsored plan was the most financially savvy choice. In 2022, with the rising costs of healthcare, I decided to explore alternative options. I compared our current plan with a self-sourced one, taking into account our tax bracket and standard deduction. The more I dug, the more questions I had. Would switching plans save us money in the long run? Or would it be a costly mistake? As I navigated the complex world of personal finance, I realized that there's no one-size-fits-all solution. I'm not alone in this dilemma - many families are facing similar choices. Join me as I share my journey of weighing the pros and cons, and discovering what works best for us."
