## Channeling My Inner Wizard (and Knitting a Cardigan)

Anyone else finding 2022 is all about escapism? Lately, I've been diving headfirst into fantasy – D&D campaigns, Tolkien re-reads, the whole shebang. It got me thinking: why not blend my two loves? I'm on the hunt for the perfect cardigan pattern, something that whispers of elven grace or a wise wizard’s study. It’s more than just a sweater; it's crafting a little piece of magic to wear. Wish me luck!
