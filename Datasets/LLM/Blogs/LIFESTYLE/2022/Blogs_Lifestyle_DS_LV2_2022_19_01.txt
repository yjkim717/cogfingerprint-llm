It’s 2022, and I’m still chasing that perfect Wi-Fi signal like it’s the secret to inner peace. Just swapped my old AC1750 for AT&T’s new BGW320—hoping for a speed boost that’ll match my ambitions. Funny how a faster connection makes me feel more in control, like maybe I can finally keep up with life’s relentless pace. Sometimes, it’s the small upgrades that bring the biggest relief.
