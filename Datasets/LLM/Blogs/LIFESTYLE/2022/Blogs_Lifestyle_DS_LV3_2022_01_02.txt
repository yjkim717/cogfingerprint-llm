Of all the questions I get asked, “What’s your favorite scent?” is the one that always gives me pause. It’s not a simple answer, because a fragrance isn’t just a smell—it’s a memory, a mood, a piece of your identity you choose to wear for the day. In 2022, a year that still felt like an awkward exhale after the chaos of the previous two, I decided to document a personal journey through 20 different perfumes. It started as a distraction, a way to add a little intentional beauty to each day, but it quickly became something much deeper: a map of my emotional landscape.

I began with the classics, the ones people call “timeless.” There’s a comfort in a well-loved **Creed** fragrance, a sense of putting on a beautifully tailored, invisible coat. It feels established, sophisticated. But what this project taught me was that a scent’s resume means very little compared to its conversation with your own skin. A fragrance hailed as a masterpiece online could fall flat on me, while a cheap, overlooked drugstore find would sing with a unique, personal harmony.

This is where the real magic—and the real frustration—lies: **longevity** and **drydown**. The initial spritz is the first impression, the blind date. But the **drydown** is the true relationship. It’s the scent that emerges hours later, the ghost of the perfume that has melded completely with you. I had a bottle that started as a sharp, green burst of citrus, a scent that promised energy and focus. I loved it for the first hour. But its **longevity** was a lie; it vanished almost completely, only to reveal a faint, slightly sour **drydown** that felt like a promise broken. It was disappointing, like a conversation that ends abruptly.

Conversely, I discovered a rich, ambery scent that was almost overwhelming at first. I wasn't sure I liked it. It was too much. But I let it sit. I went about my day—made coffee, answered emails, went for a walk. And hours later, as I was winding down for the evening, I caught a whisper of it on my sweater. The **drydown** was a revelation. The initial intensity had softened into a warm, creamy, and deeply comforting skin-scent. It had **longevity**, but more importantly, it had a story. It had evolved. It felt like a metaphor for that year itself: starting with uncertainty and settling into a quieter, more resilient version of myself.

This journey through 20 different bottles was a masterclass in self-awareness. I learned that I’m drawn to scents that transform, that have a narrative arc. I learned that my skin chemistry turns some vanilla notes gourmand and sweet, and others into a smoky, almost leathery accord. It’s a deeply individual level of interaction that no five-star **review** can ever truly capture for you.

So, what did I learn from my 20-scents-of-2022 project? I learned that choosing a fragrance is one of the most intimate and fleeting forms of self-expression. It’s art that only exists in the air around you, a personal signature that others experience only in passing. It taught me to be patient, to look beyond the first impression, and to appreciate the beautiful, slow reveal of the
