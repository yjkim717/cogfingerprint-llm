>## The Long Search and Letting Go

Remember that feeling of boundless possibility? That’s what house hunting felt like at the start of 2022. My partner and I were finally serious about leaving the rental life behind and finding a place to truly call our own. We found a fantastic buyer's agent, Sarah, who really *got* our vision – a quirky Victorian with good light and a manageable garden. 

Months flew by. Open house after open house. Bidding wars we lost. Disappointment piled on disappointment. Honestly, the process started to feel… heavy. Sarah was patient, always positive, but I’d find myself second-guessing everything. Was this house the right choice? Was *I* the right buyer? 

Then, it hit me: the relationship with Sarah, initially a source of support, was starting to feel like a burden. We weren't vibing anymore. It was a tough conversation, admitting it felt like we needed to go our separate ways.  Ultimately, it was the right decision. Sometimes, even the best partnerships need a pause, a reset, to allow everyone to find their way back to that initial spark of hope. Now, we're starting fresh, and I'm feeling that possibility again.
