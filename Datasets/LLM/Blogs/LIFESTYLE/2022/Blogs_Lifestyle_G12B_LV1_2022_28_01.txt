## The Pursuit of Powder & Perspective

This year, the itch to ski was *intense*. I was staring at Mt. Baker's season pass prices, feeling a familiar pang of disappointment. They’re steep, and honestly, a bit hard to snag. Then it hit me – why chase exclusivity so hard? My friend raved about the ease and value of an Epic Pass, opening up Whistler. It made me think about more than just skiing. Are we sometimes paying a premium for a feeling of “specialness” when joy and accessibility are often intertwined? Maybe this winter, I'll trade a little prestige for a lot more turns.




Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
