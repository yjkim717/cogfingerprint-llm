**The Weight of a New Language, a New Continent**

Okay, deep breath. 2022 felt like a year of big decisions, didn’t it? I was staring down the barrel of an Erasmus application, specifically dreaming of a European adventure as a computer engineering student. The thought of studying abroad was exhilarating, but honestly, a little terrifying. 

My biggest worry? Getting lost in the translation – both literally and figuratively. I’m from Spain, and while I speak Spanish fluently, the idea of navigating a new university, a different language, and a whole new culture felt… weighty. 

I kept circling back to the same questions: Where could I realistically manage my studies *and* actually experience Europe? Affordability was key, and I desperately wanted a place with a decent amount of English spoken. It’s a delicate balance, right?  Ultimately, it’s about more than just ticking off a box – it’s about truly opening yourself up to a different way of life.
