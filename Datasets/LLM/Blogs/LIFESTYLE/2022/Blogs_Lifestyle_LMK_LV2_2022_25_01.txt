As I navigated the busy streets in my trusty vehicle, dashing between Doordash deliveries, I never thought I'd be caught off guard by a car accident at a flashing yellow light intersection. But, in a split second, it happened. Now, I'm left wondering - who's at fault? Louisiana laws can be complex, and as a gig economy driver, I'm not sure what my insurance covers. As I reflect on that chaotic day in 2022, I'm reminded that life is unpredictable, and being informed is key to staying safe on the roads.
