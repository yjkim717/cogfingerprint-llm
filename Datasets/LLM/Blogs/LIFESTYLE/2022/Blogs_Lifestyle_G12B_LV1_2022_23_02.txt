>## The Unexpected Pause

It's funny how life throws little curveballs, isn't it? Yesterday, while rushing across campus – late for a meeting, as usual – I saw it. A little black and white dog, a fluffy corgi mix, just wandering near Shands and the Psychology building. He looked utterly lost, tail tucked, ears drooping. 

It completely stopped me in my tracks. Usually, I'm all about efficiency, maximizing every minute. But seeing that little guy, so vulnerable and clearly missing his person, gave me a sudden, unexpected pause. 

I spent a good ten minutes just watching him, hoping his owner would appear. It made me think about how often we get caught up in the relentless pace of things, how easily we forget to simply *notice* the world around us. Maybe a little bit of "lost dog" energy is exactly what we all need sometimes – a reminder to slow down and appreciate the unexpected moments, and to be a little kinder to ourselves and those around us.
