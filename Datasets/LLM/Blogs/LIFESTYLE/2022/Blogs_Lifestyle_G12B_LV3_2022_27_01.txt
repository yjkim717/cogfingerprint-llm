## When Storylines Leave You Feeling… Flat

Okay, Gilmore Girls fans, let's talk. I just re-watched the season where Sookie discovers Jackson’s vasectomy was… not. And honestly? I'm still processing the disappointment. It's not that I dislike the characters – Sookie and Jackson Belleville are a joy! – but the way this plot twist unfolded felt jarring. 

It felt like manufactured drama, a way to create conflict where genuine, heartwarming moments could have thrived. It really got me thinking about storytelling in general, and how sometimes, twists meant to shock can just leave you feeling a little…deflated. Anyone else feel this way? It’s 2022, and I crave authenticity, even (and especially) in my comfort shows.
