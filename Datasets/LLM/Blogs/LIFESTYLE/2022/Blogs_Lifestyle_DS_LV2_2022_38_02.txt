It’s funny how life nudges you in directions you never expected. Just last year, I was that fresh-faced software engineering grad, staring at my screen, wondering what was next. The world felt both wide open and intimidatingly vast.

I remember late nights scrolling through university websites, weighing countries like Canada against Germany, wrestling with GRE prep, and clinging to hope for scholarships. Each application felt like sending a message in a bottle into an ocean of dreams.

Now, looking back from 2022, that leap into studying abroad wasn’t just about career moves—it was about trusting the journey. Sometimes, the scariest "what ifs" lead to the most beautiful "what’s next."
