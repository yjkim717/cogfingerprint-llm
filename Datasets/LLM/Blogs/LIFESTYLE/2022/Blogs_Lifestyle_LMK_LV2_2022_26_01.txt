"Embracing the Quiet Revolution: My Struggle with Laptop Noise"

As I sat in a crowded coffee shop in 2022, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with my Zephyrus G14 laptop's loud fan noise, despite being in silent mode via Armoury Crate. The whirring was distracting, and the heat emanating from it made me uncomfortable. I wondered, isn't silent mode supposed to be, well, silent? After some trial and error, I discovered that disabling CPU boosting was the key to a quieter, cooler laptop. Now, I can focus on my work, not my laptop's fan noise.
