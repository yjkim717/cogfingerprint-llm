>## The Quiet Terror of Late Nights

It’s funny, isn't it, how we chase thrills? Lately, I’ve been diving deep into audio dramas, specifically the unsettling kind. I stumbled upon *Tribulation* and *Video Palace* – seriously, those things burrowed under my skin! It’s a strange comfort, I think, to be scared in a controlled environment, especially when the world outside feels… a lot.

2022 has been a year of quiet anxieties, hasn't it? The constant news cycle, the feeling of things shifting beneath our feet. So, I find myself gravitating towards these immersive soundscapes, these stories that tap into primal fears. It's a weirdly soothing way to process the unease, to find a safe space *within* the darkness. Anyone else finding solace in unexpected corners?
