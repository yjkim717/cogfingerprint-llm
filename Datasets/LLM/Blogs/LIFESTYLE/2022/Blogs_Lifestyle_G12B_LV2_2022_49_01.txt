Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational tone, set in 2022. I've focused on the feeling of connection and how routines can subtly shift even in strong relationships.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: The Quiet Shift: Reclaiming Connection When Miles Divide**

Remember that feeling of breathless excitement when you first started talking to someone new? Every phone call felt like a lifeline, a stolen moment brimming with discovery. Now, years later, and with thousands of miles separating us thanks to my overseas work, I've noticed something… our calls have become a little… routine. 

It's not that we *don't* connect, but the spark feels dimmed. We report on our days, the logistics of life, but the deeper conversations, the shared laughter that used to bubble up effortlessly? They’re rarer.

2022 has been a year of a lot of reflection for me. I realized we’d fallen into a comfortable, but somewhat shallow, groove. It hit me that maintaining a long-distance relationship isn’t about *just* making calls, it’s about actively *creating* connection.  We're working on shaking up those routines – dedicated "no-agenda" calls, sharing silly videos, really *listening* when the other speaks. It's a conscious effort, but so worth it. Because even across oceans, the heart remembers the feeling of truly being *seen*.
