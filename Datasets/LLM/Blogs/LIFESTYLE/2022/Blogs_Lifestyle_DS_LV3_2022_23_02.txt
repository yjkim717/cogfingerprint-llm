It was one of those crisp 2022 afternoons on campus when I spotted her—a sweet corgi mix trotting alone near Shands and the Psychology building, no collar in sight. My heart sank. In that moment, the frantic search for her owner felt like a metaphor for our own lives. How often do we wander, feeling a little lost and disconnected, hoping someone is looking for us? It’s a reminder to pause, look around, and extend a little kindness. You never know whose world you might help piece back together.
