The 4th of July weekend in 2022 was supposed to be my chance to finally slow down. But there I was, in the bustling meat department, fielding one special request after another. A custom-cut steak here, a specific bratwurst there—each ask felt like another log on an already roaring fire.

In that retail chaos, I had a moment of clarity. How often do we, in our own lives, make unreasonable demands when others are already stretched thin? That holiday weekend taught me about grace under pressure—both giving and receiving it. Sometimes the most patriotic act isn't the perfect barbecue, but recognizing the shared humanity in those busy aisles.
