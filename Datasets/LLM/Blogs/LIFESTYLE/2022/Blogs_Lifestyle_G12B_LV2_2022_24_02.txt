## The Performative Plate: When Good Intentions Feel a Little… Off?

It's 2022, and veganism is *everywhere*. Which is amazing! Seeing more plant-based options and awareness is genuinely exciting. But lately, I’ve been grappling with a weird feeling around it all. 

I've noticed a trend – TV chefs, people I genuinely admire for their culinary skills, showcasing gorgeous vegan recipes one week, then whipping up a perfectly seared steak the next. And I get it, they're professionals, they need to appeal to a broad audience. But it leaves me feeling… a little deflated. 

It’s not about judging their choices, truly. It’s more about this sense of performative wokeness. Like, are we celebrating the *effort* of a single vegan dish, or the actual commitment to a lifestyle that minimizes harm? I know, I know – it’s a complex issue. And maybe I'm being overly sensitive. But sometimes, I just wish authenticity felt a little more…palpable.  It makes me question whether genuine change is happening, or if it's all just a carefully curated image. What do you think?
