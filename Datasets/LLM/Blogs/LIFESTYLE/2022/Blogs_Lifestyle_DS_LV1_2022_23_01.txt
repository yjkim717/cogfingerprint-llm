Looking back on that final semester of 2022, I still don't know how I managed it. Between my two part-time jobs and those last major requirements, every day was a marathon. EEL3872 and ALS3200C weren't just courses—they were massive time commitments that demanded my full attention. I'd rush from work to campus, fueled by coffee and the sheer determination to graduate. It taught me that while you can push your limits, balance isn't a luxury—it's a necessity. I graduated, but I learned more about my boundaries than any syllabus could ever teach.
