Okay, deep breath, everyone. So, I finally did it – graduated law school! Cue the confetti and the crippling anxiety of the bar exam. But here’s a twist: I'm transferring to a different state, and the prospect of shelling out *another* fortune for Barbri is… well, it’s making me question everything.

Let's talk – I need to know I'm not alone in this legal preparation rollercoaster!
