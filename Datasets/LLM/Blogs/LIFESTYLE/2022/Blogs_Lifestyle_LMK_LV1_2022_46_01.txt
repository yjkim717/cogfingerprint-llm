As I upgraded my 3D printing setup in 2022, I realized the importance of a reliable heat bed. My old textured PEI springsteel bed was bending, causing print issues. After researching, I found a suitable 355x355mm replacement with a magnetic sheet for easy print removal. The new bed's stability improved my prints, and I learned to appreciate the little upgrades that make a big difference in my hobby.
