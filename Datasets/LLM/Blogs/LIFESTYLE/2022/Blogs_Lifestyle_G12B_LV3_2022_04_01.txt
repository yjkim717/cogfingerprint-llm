>## Rediscovering Wonder: Why My Midwestern Adventure Changed Everything

It’s funny how sometimes the biggest adventures aren’t the ones you plan across oceans. Last summer, I found myself craving a change, a break from the relentless scroll of social media and the feeling that I was missing… something. So, I did something completely unexpected: I explored my own backyard. 

I dove headfirst into the Midwest – hiking through state parks in Wisconsin, kayaking down winding rivers in Iowa, and camping under a blanket of stars in Michigan. It was glorious. Truly. I’d always associated "vacation" with far-flung destinations, but this felt different. It felt *real*. 

2022 threw a lot at us, didn't it? Travel felt complicated, expensive, and sometimes, just plain overwhelming.  But this trip reminded me that adventure isn't defined by distance. It’s about presence, about disconnecting, and about finding beauty in the unexpected. 

Now, as I'm already dreaming of next year's escape, I’m wondering: what hidden gems are *you* discovering close to home?  Any Midwest recommendations? I'm all ears! Let's trade travel tips and rediscover the wonder that’s waiting just around the corner.
