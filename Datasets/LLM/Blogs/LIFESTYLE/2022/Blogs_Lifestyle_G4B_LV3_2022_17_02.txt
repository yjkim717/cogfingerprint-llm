**The Quiet Battle of the Daily Kanji**

2022 felt… intense, didn’t it? Like everyone was sprinting towards some invisible finish line. And I was trying to sprint towards *Japanese*. I’d always been captivated by the language – the beautiful script, the unique culture – but actually *learning* it? That felt like a constant uphill struggle. 

There were days, honestly, where the sheer volume of new vocabulary and grammar rules felt overwhelming. I’d start strong, fueled by initial motivation, then watch it slowly dwindle as life got in the way. Time management became my nemesis. 

What pulled me through wasn’t grand gestures or huge blocks of study time. It was tiny, consistent efforts. Fifteen minutes with a textbook, a Duolingo lesson during my lunch break, even just writing a few kanji. It was about building a habit, a quiet daily battle I could actually win. 

I realized that motivation fluctuates, but consistency is the bedrock. It’s the little wins that accumulate and eventually lead to real progress. And that, I think, is a lesson worth carrying into the next year.

Do you want me to tweak this draft in any way – perhaps adjust the tone, add a specific anecdote, or focus on a different aspect of the summary?
