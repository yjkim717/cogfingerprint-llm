The glow of my phone screen feels like a tiny campfire in the dark, a small beacon connecting my world to hers, hundreds of miles away. For fifteen years, our nightly calls have been the anchor of our long-distance rhythm. But lately, our conversations had fallen into a comfortable, yet predictable, rut. "How was work?" "Fine." "What's for dinner?" "Pasta."

It was in 2022, amidst the world's chaotic reopening, that I realized our romantic connection deserved more than just a routine check-in. I started asking one unexpected question each call: "What made you feel truly alive today?" or "If you had a theme song for this week, what would it be?"

Suddenly, the mundane details of our days transformed. We weren't just sharing schedules; we were sharing souls again. The distance didn't shrink, but the space between our hearts did, one intentional, engaging question at a time.
