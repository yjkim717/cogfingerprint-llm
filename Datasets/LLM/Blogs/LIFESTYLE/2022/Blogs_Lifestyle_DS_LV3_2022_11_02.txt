It was 2022, and I realized my digital life deserved the same care as my physical space. My Debian NAS held years of memories, yet felt exposed. So I embarked on a weekend project: moving the root directory to an encrypted LUKS disk. Copying files felt like packing precious belongings into a secure vault. Editing the fstab was the final lockâ€”a simple line of code granting peace of mind. Now, my data rests safely encrypted, a quiet victory in our increasingly transparent world.
