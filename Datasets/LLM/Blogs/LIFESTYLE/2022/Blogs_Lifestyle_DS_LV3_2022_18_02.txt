It’s 2022, and my late-night routine has shifted from doomscrolling to diving into audio dramas—but not just any. I’m hunting for horror that respects its own world, the kind that leaves you genuinely unnerved. Shows like *Tribulation* and *Video Palace* set the bar: immersive, terrifying, and dead serious. If you’ve felt the same craving, you know it’s not just about a scare—it’s about stories that linger, making the shadows in your own home feel a little more real.
