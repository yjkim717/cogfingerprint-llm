## The One That Got Away (and What It Taught Me)

It’s funny how a fishing trip can stick with you. Last fall, out at Bob Sikes Cut, I hooked something *big*. I’m pretty sure it was either a snook or a redfish – a real bruiser. The fight was incredible, a surging pull that tested every ounce of skill I had. My braid line screamed off the reel, and honestly, I was grinning like an idiot.

Then, *snap*. Gone. Line and lure vanished into the Gulf. I was bummed, sure, but also… exhilarated. It was a humbling reminder that nature’s power is undeniable. It’s 2022, and we’re all so focused on control, on achieving. Sometimes, losing that control – letting go – is the most rewarding experience of all. It’s a lesson I’m trying to carry with me, on and off the water.
