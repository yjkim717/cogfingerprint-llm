It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my computer screen, diploma in hand, wondering, “What’s next?” As a fresh software engineering grad, the world feels both vast and intimidating. I’ve decided to chase higher education abroad—somewhere with strong career prospects for developers. But where? And how?

I’m diving into test prep guides and scholarship applications, hoping for a mentor to light the way. It’s more than just a degree; it’s about shaping a future where passion meets purpose. If you’ve walked this path, I’d love your guidance. Sometimes, the bravest step is admitting you don’t have all the answers.
