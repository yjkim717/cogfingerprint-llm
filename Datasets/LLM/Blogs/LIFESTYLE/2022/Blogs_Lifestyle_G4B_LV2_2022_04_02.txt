**The Day My Garage Door Started Talking Back**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 felt like a year of little, frustrating battles. Between rising costs and the constant feeling of ‘just one more thing’ on my to-do list, I was running on fumes. And then, my garage door started acting up. 

It wasn’t a dramatic, Hollywood-style malfunction. More like a series of subtle, infuriating hiccups. Sometimes it’d only open halfway, leaving me staring at a frustrating gap. Other times, the sensors would go haywire, refusing to let me in or out. I spent a solid weekend armed with YouTube tutorials and a whole lot of muttered curses, trying to diagnose a mechanical issue. 

It was strangely meditative, actually.  I started noticing the little things – the way the chain rattled, the exact angle the opener needed to be adjusted. It felt like a tiny, contained problem in an otherwise chaotic life. 

What really struck me, though, was how much this little door represented all the times I’ve felt blocked, unable to fully move forward. Like a partial opening, a little bit of progress but never quite the whole picture. 

Eventually, a repairman fixed it – a simple alignment issue. But the experience lingered. It reminded me that sometimes, the biggest obstacles aren’t the grand, sweeping challenges, but the small, persistent frustrations that chip away at your peace of mind.  And sometimes, just getting *that* door to work properly can be a surprisingly good thing.
