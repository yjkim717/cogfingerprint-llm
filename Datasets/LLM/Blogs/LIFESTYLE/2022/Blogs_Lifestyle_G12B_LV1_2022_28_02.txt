## The Never-Ending Bath Mat Quest (and My Roomba's Suffering)

Okay, 2022 has been… a year. But honestly, one of my biggest domestic battles has been finding a decent bath mat. I've been down the microfiber rabbit hole (shedding nightmare!), and latex is a definite no-go for this household. Plus, my Roomba deserves better than battling a soggy, tangled mess! Reddit suggested some promising options, so wish me luck on round three of the bath mat hunt. My floors – and my robot vacuum – are counting on me.
