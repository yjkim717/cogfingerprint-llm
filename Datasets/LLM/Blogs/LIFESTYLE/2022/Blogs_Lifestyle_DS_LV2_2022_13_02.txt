It’s 2022, and I’m sitting here scrolling through endless reels of picture-perfect lives, wondering how everyone else seems to have it all figured out. My own living room feels cluttered, my schedule’s a mess, and honestly? I’m tired of chasing someone else’s idea of “having it together.”

So, I decided to try something different: a digital detox weekend. No feeds, no filters—just me, a good book, and a long walk in the park. And you know what? It was messy, quiet, and completely imperfect. But for the first time in months, I felt present. Sometimes, the best upgrade to your lifestyle isn’t adding more—it’s clearing out the noise and rediscovering what truly fills your cup.
