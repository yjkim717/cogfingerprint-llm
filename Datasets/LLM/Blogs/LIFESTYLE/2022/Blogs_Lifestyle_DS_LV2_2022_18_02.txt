It’s 2022, and I’ve been chasing that spine-tingling feeling only a truly terrifying horror audio drama can deliver. I wanted more than jump scares—I craved a serious, immersive world that felt real. My search led me down a dark path, a genuine tribulation through podcasts like "Video Palace." It’s funny how a voice in the dark can make you double-check the locks, reminding you that the best horror respects your fear.
