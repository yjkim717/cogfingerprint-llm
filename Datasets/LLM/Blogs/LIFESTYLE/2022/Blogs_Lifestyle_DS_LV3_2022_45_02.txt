It was supposed to be simple: buy our first home, lock in the rate, and start our new life. But then came the closing delay, and with it, a $345 rate lock extension fee. Suddenly, I’m not just a first-time buyer—I’m a gambler in 2022’s unpredictable mortgage market. Do I pay to keep our rate secure, or bet that it won’t spike before we sign? It’s a pricey lesson in patience, reminding me that even the most exciting milestones come with unexpected hurdles. Sometimes, adulthood feels like one tough decision after another.
