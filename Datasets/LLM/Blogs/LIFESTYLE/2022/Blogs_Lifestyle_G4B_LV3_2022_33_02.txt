**The 700-Score Wall: Feeling Stuck in NYC?**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 in New York City felt…complicated.  I was scrolling through listings for a new apartment, and it hit me: a *700* credit score. Seriously? It felt like a brick wall, a seemingly arbitrary hurdle built just to keep people out. 

I’ve always believed that a city like NYC should be about opportunity, but this felt different. It’s not just about being responsible; it’s about systemic barriers.  So many people – young professionals, recent graduates, immigrants – are facing financial difficulties, and suddenly, a good job and a stable life feel a million miles away because of a number. 

It made me think about fairness and how we, as a city, are unintentionally erecting these financial roadblocks.  Are we truly fostering a place where everyone has a chance to thrive, or are we creating a system that favors those who already have a head start?  It’s a frustrating conversation, but one we *need* to keep having.
