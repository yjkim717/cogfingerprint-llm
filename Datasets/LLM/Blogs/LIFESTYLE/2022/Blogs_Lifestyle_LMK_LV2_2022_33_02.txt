"Renting in NYC: Is a 700 Credit Score a Fair Ask?"

As I scrolled through apartment listings in NYC last week, I noticed a trend that left me scratching my head - many landlords were requiring a minimum credit score of 700 to rent an apartment. Seven hundred! That's a high bar, especially for young professionals or those new to the city. It got me thinking, is this requirement fair? Doesn't it unfairly discriminate against those who are already struggling to make ends meet or have had financial setbacks in the past? In a city where rental prices are sky-high, shouldn't we be working towards making housing more accessible, not less? As we push for housing reform, shouldn't financial literacy be part of the conversation too? It's time to rethink the role credit scores play in renting an apartment in NYC. Is a 700 credit score really the best indicator of a reliable tenant?
