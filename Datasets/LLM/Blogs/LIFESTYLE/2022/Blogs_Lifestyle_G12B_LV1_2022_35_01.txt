>## The River Remembers, and So Do I

There's something about the Ohio River that gets under your skin. Maybe it’s the constant churn, the way the current never truly stills, or the sheer volume of water carrying stories downstream. This past summer, I found myself drawn back to it, not for catfish this time, but for just…fishing. 

It’s a different challenge, you know? The Ohio isn't a placid lake. You can’t just cast a line and wait. You’re battling the flow, contending with snags and debris swirling just beneath the surface. I spent hours experimenting with different rigs – heavier sinkers to keep the bait down, specialized setups to avoid getting tangled in the river’s clutter. It felt like a puzzle, a constant recalibration against the river’s will.

And honestly, that’s what life feels like sometimes, doesn't it?  2022 has been a year of currents I didn't anticipate, obstacles I hadn’t prepared for. But sitting on that dock, figuring out how to present a simple worm or minnow against the relentless flow, I found a quiet kind of peace. The river keeps moving, regardless.  It remembers the storms, the floods, the quiet days.  And maybe, just maybe, learning to adapt to its rhythm is a lesson worth carrying with me.
