There’s something meditative about standing on that old Ohio River dock, watching the current rush past. In 2022, life felt like that fast-moving water—full of debris and constant motion. I’d spend hours there, adjusting my rig and watching the live bait dance, not just for the fish, but for the quiet. It taught me to find my anchor in the chaos, to be patient and present. That simple dock became my sanctuary, a reminder that sometimes the best way to move forward is to stand perfectly still.
