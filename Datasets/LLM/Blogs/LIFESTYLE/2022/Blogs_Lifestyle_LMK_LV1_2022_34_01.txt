As I sat down to crunch the numbers for our family's health insurance, I couldn't help but wonder if ditching our employer-sponsored plan for a self-sourced one would be the way to go. My spouse and I have been fortunate enough to have stable jobs with great benefits, but with our tax bracket hovering around the standard deduction, I questioned whether it made sense to stick with the status quo. We have a few medical expenses that we could potentially itemize, but would it be worth the hassle? As I weighed our options, I realized that switching to a self-sourced plan could potentially save us thousands. But, it also meant giving up the convenience and security of having our premiums deducted pre-tax. As we navigate the ever-changing landscape of healthcare in 2022, I'm left pondering: is the potential savings worth the risk?
