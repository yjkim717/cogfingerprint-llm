**The River Called to Me**

There’s something about the Ohio River that just pulls at you, doesn’t it? I was feeling a bit lost in 2022, like I needed to really *feel* something. So, I grabbed my old fishing rig, a simple setup with some nightcrawlers – the bait for catfish, of course. 

Spending hours battling the current, dodging debris, it forced me to slow down. It wasn’t just about the catch; it was about the quiet persistence, the acceptance of the river’s challenges.  Maybe that’s what we all need sometimes – a little reminder to just *be* in the face of the flow.
