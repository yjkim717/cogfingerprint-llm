It’s 2022, and I’ve been sober for over a year now. At first, I worried I’d lose my spark—that creative buzz I thought only a drink could bring. But I’ve discovered the opposite is true. My evenings, once hazy, are now filled with writing and sketching. I’ve even joined a local art group, a community that celebrates raw talent over rounds at the bar. We gather not to toast with glasses, but with our latest creations. This journey has shown me that real celebration isn’t found at the bottom of a bottle—it’s in sharing what we create, fully present and alive.
