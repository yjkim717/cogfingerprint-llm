The pink bottle sat on our kitchen counter for two weeks, a cheerful bubble gum beacon of pure parental frustration. It was the winter of 2022, and my seven-month-old had her first ear infection. The pediatrician prescribed the usual course of antibiotics, assuring me the “bubble gum flavor” was a hit with kids.

What they don’t tell you in the parenting manuals is that “bubble gum flavor” to an infant apparently translates to “suspicious, syrupy poison.” Every twelve hours, the battle commenced. I’d gently hold her, cooing reassuringly as she smiled up at me, trusting. Then the plastic syringe would appear.

Her face would crumple. The tiny, strong jaw would clamp shut, a fortress against the pink invader. What followed was a heartbreaking dance of gentle coaxing, failed attempts, and ultimately, the dreaded force-feeding. I’d manage to squirt a little into her cheek, only for most of it to be pushed out by her tongue, dripping down her chin and onto my shirt. Each wasted dose felt like a personal failure, a tiny setback in her recovery. I’d look at the sticky, pink-stained cloth and feel a wave of guilt and exhaustion. Was I causing more trauma than I was curing?

It was in those messy, medicine-scented moments that I truly learned a raw truth of early parenthood: sometimes love doesn’t look like a cuddle. Sometimes, it’s holding your sobbing child steady, administering the yucky stuff they need to get better, and hoping that one day they’ll understand it all came from a place of desperate, bubble-gum-flavored love.
