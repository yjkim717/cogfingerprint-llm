### The Joy of a Digital Declutter

It was a Saturday in 2022, and my laptop desktop was a digital junkyard. Hundreds of files, from vacation photos to work spreadsheets, were piled in a chaotic mess. The overwhelm was real. Sound familiar?

I decided enough was enough. I started with the simple stuff—deleting old screenshots—and soon found myself in a state of flow, sorting, archiving, and labeling. It wasn't just about freeing up disk space; it was about freeing up mental space. Each file I organized felt like a tiny weight lifted.

By the evening, I had a clean slate. More importantly, I felt a surprising sense of calm. In a world that constantly pushes more—more content, more notifications, more stuff—I’d found a small pocket of peace by intentionally creating less. It’s amazing how a little digital housekeeping can feel so profoundly… human.
