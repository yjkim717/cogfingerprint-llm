## Second Time's the Charm (and Maybe a Practical Test?)

Okay, deep breaths. It’s 2022, and I’m staring down the barrel of the theory test *again*. Seriously, who knew identifying a pedestrian stepping out between parked cars could be so stressful? My first attempt…let’s just say it wasn’t my finest hour. 

My driving instructor, bless him, has been incredibly patient. He keeps saying I'm ready, and even my mum’s chiming in, encouraging me to move onto the practical. Honestly, the thought of actually *driving* feels a little overwhelming right now. 

But there's a weird sense of determination building. This time, I've really drilled the hazard perception clips, and I’m feeling noticeably more confident. It’s a small step, I know, but it feels like progress. Maybe tackling this test head-on is exactly what I need – a bit of a challenge to push me forward. Fingers crossed I can finally tick this off the list! Wish me luck!
