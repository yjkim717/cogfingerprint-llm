## The Japanese Jitters & the Constant Question: Am I Even Making Progress?

Okay, let's be real. 2022 has been…a lot. And my Japanese studies? They’ve been a rollercoaster. I started with so much enthusiasm, envisioning myself effortlessly ordering ramen in Tokyo and understanding every nuance of Studio Ghibli films. The reality, as it often does, looks a little different.

I’m putting in the hours. Duolingo streaks, textbook drills, even attempting to watch Japanese dramas with subtitles (which mostly results in me pausing every five seconds). Yet, this nagging anxiety keeps creeping in. Am I *actually* learning? Or am I just going through the motions?

It’s a feeling I think a lot of us experience, especially when tackling something as complex as a new language. That little voice whispering, “Is this worth it? Are you even improving?” It’s exhausting.

The truth is, life outside of Japanese is demanding. Work, family, the general chaos of the world… it all chips away at my energy and focus. Finding the time to dedicate myself fully feels impossible some days.

So, I’m reaching out. Fellow language learners, anyone else struggling with this motivation dip? What are your study habits looking like when you're feeling drained? Do you have any tips for silencing that inner critic and just *enjoying* the process, even when progress feels slow? 

I'm looking for a little solidarity and maybe a few practical suggestions. Because right now, I just want to remember why I started learning Japanese in the first place – the joy of connecting with a culture I admire, and the quiet satisfaction of understanding just a little bit more.
