As we navigate the complexities of the digital age in 2022, it's alarming to think about the risks our young people face online. I've been reflecting on the importance of having open conversations with minors about online safety, particularly when it comes to sexting and sharing illicit images. The reality is, many young people are unaware of the severe legal implications of sending or requesting explicit content. As a society, it's our responsibility to educate and guide them. By sharing our own experiences and the potential consequences of their actions, we can empower them to make informed decisions. Let's take a proactive approach to safeguarding their digital footprint and well-being. By doing so, we can help them develop healthy online habits and a deeper understanding of the digital world's nuances. It's time to have these crucial conversations and support our young people in staying safe online.
