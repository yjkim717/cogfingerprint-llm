**The Echo in the Line**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How distance can shrink a relationship, and yet, simultaneously, stretch it out into an endless, echoing space. I’ve been wrestling with this lately, navigating a long-distance connection myself. We’re talking weekly phone calls, but they’ve become…well, predictable.

It’s about finding ways to share experiences, even across miles.  I’m trying to be more intentional about asking about the small things – the rain, a funny meme, a new recipe.
