## The Price of Powder Dreams

Remember that feeling of giddy anticipation for winter? This year, chasing that feeling feels… complicated. I've been staring at season pass prices, specifically Mt. Baker's, and feeling a pang of disappointment. It's tough when the dream – carving fresh lines on Baker – clashes so sharply with the reality of cost and limited access. It makes you wonder, is chasing passions always this financially draining? Maybe this year, Whistler’s Epic Pass is calling, a slightly less romantic, but more practical, adventure.
