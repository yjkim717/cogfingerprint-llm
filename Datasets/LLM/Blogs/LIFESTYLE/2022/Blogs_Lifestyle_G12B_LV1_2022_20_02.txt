>## The Unexpected Joy of Letting Go (and Helping Others)

This year, our school's student council decided to host a clothing drive, partnering with local thrift shops like Savers and Value Village. Itâ€™s been surprisingly rewarding! Sorting through our closets, deciding what to donate, felt like a mini-reset. There's a genuine joy in knowing gently used clothes will find a new life and support a good cause. Plus, decluttering? A win-win! Anyone else find unexpected peace in letting go?
