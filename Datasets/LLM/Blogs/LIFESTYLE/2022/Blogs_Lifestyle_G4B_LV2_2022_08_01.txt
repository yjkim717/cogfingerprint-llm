**The Quiet Shift: Watching My Son Retreat**

It’s funny how quickly things can change, isn’t it? Like, one minute you’re juggling soccer practices and school plays, and the next you’re staring at a wall, wondering where the energy went. Lately, that’s been my reality, and it's centered around my 12-year-old, Leo.

He used to *love* his friends. Birthday parties, video games, building elaborate Lego castles – he was a whirlwind of activity. But over the last couple of years, especially with the lingering effects of the pandemic, he’s started pulling back. It’s not dramatic, not shouting or slamming doors, just…a quiet withdrawal. 

It started subtly, a less enthusiastic “yes” to invitations, a quicker retreat to his room. Now, he’s hesitant to join in even family activities. My frustration is real, of course. I just want to understand, to offer a comforting hug and a solution. 

I’ve been reading a lot about the impact of COVID on childhood development – the anxiety, the disrupted routines, the feeling of uncertainty. It makes a lot of sense, doesn’t it?  It’s like a little piece of him is still processing everything that happened, and he’s building a wall to protect himself. 

Right now, I’m trying to focus on creating a safe space, offering gentle invitations without pressure, and just being *present*. It’s a slow process, and honestly, it’s a little terrifying. But I know, deep down, that patience and understanding are the best tools we have.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way – perhaps add a specific example, or adjust the tone further?
