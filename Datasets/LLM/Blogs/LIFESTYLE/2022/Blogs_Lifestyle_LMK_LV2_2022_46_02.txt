As I stood in front of my 3D printer in 2022, watching it pause mid-print, I couldn't help but think of life's unexpected pauses. Just like my printer, life can halt suddenly, requiring user intervention. Using Klipper and Superslicer, I discovered a solution to signal when my print was paused. Similarly, in life, we need to acknowledge and respond to our own pauses. Whether it's a career change or a personal loss, embracing the pause can lead to new opportunities and growth. What will you do when life pauses?
