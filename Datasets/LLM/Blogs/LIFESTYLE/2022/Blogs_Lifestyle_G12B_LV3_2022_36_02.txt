## My Galaxy S9 & a Little Bit of Worry

It’s funny how attached we get to our tech, isn’t it? I’ve been rocking my Samsung Galaxy S9 (the G9600 variant, specifically) for years now, and it’s still my daily driver. Lately, though, I've been noticing some frustrating network connectivity hiccups, especially on Verizon. 

I picked up this phone when I was traveling in Latin America, and it's been a faithful companion. But now, back in the US, I'm starting to wonder about its long-term viability. Has anyone else with a similar variant experienced this? Are US S9 users still finding it reliable in 2022? It’s a small thing, I know, but it makes me reflect on how quickly technology evolves and the bittersweet feeling of a beloved device potentially reaching its end.
