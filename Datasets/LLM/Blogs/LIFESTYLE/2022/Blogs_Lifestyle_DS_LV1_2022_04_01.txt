### Finding Adventure in Our Own Backyard

Remember that feeling in 2022? Just as we were ready to stamp our passports again, the world felt… wobbly. My big international plans were shelved, replaced by a restless energy. Staring at a flight tracker wasn't helping, so I decided to look closer to home.

I traded my suitcase for a backpack and turned my gaze to the Midwest. What I found was a quiet revelation. Winding forest trails became my meditation, the rhythm of my bike on a crushed limestone path my new soundtrack, and the gentle current of a local river my guide.

It was a powerful reminder that you don’t need a transatlantic flight to find wonder. Sometimes, the most profound journeys are the ones that reconnect you with the landscape just outside your door. My work holidays are now dedicated to exploring the hidden gems in our own backyard, and I’ve never felt more grounded.
