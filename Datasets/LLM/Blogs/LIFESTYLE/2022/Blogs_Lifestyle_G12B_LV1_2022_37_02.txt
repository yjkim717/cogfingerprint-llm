>## Channeling My Inner Dungeon Master (and Knitter)

Okay, so I've been *really* into D&D lately. Like, seriously. And my brain, naturally, has decided that translates into wanting to knit a cardigan that looks like it belongs to a slightly-too-chill elvish wizard or a rogue who favors comfort over chainmail. 

I’m scouring Ravelry for cardigan patterns with a vaguely medieval, vaguely magical vibe. It's a new obsession, blending cozy crafting with fantastical character design. Wish me luck finding the perfect yarn – something earthy and mysterious, you know?
