>## The Line Breaks, and So Does Life Sometimes

The salt spray still stings my face, even thinking about it. Last week, I was out on the beach, surf fishing like I’ve done a hundred times before. It was a gorgeous evening – the kind where the sun bleeds orange and pink across the sky, and the only sound is the rhythmic crash of the waves. I was using a SP Minnow, hoping for a redfish or maybe a snook, and felt that undeniable *thump* – a solid weight pulling back.

This wasn't a little nibble. This was a *pull*. My reel screamed as line ripped off the spool, braid singing a high-pitched whine. I fought it for what felt like an eternity, the rod bending double, my arms burning. I genuinely thought I had something huge. 

Then, *snap*. 

The line went slack. Just like that. Gone. Whatever it was, it was powerful enough to break my braid. Disappointment stung, of course, but it was quickly replaced by something else. A strange sense of…peace? It was a reminder that sometimes, no matter how hard you fight, things break. Life throws these unexpected snags. You brace yourself, you put in the work, and sometimes, the line just breaks. And you know what? That’s okay. You pick up your gear, reset, and head back out.
