There I was, 2022, and suddenly my phone was a blur. Presbyopia had arrived. As a lifelong contact lens wearer, the thought of reading glasses felt like defeat. But my eye doctor introduced me to multifocal contacts—game changer! Now I can read menus and spot my friend across the café, all without fumbling for specs. It’s a small win, but it feels like getting a piece of my old self back.
