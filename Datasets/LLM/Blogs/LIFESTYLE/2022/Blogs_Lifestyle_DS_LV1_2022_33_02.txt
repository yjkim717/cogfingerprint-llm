### The Number That Almost Cost Me My Home

I’ll never forget the gut-punch feeling of seeing my dream apartment in Brooklyn. Sun-drenched, great location, and then… the fine print: "Minimum 700 credit score required." My heart sank. I had a stable job, paid my bills, and was a responsible tenant. But my score, thanks to a few student loan missteps years ago, was a 688.

That three-digit number felt like a judgment on my entire character. I wasn't a person with a good job and solid references; I was a "risk." It’s a modern-day form of gatekeeping that has nothing to do with whether you’ll pay rent on time.

This experience in 2022 was a brutal lesson in how our system is stacked. We talk about a housing crisis, yet we allow arbitrary, sky-high credit scores to slam doors shut. It’s not just about financial literacy; it’s about fairness. True housing reform needs to challenge these barriers, because everyone deserves a place to call home, not just those with a flawless financial past.
