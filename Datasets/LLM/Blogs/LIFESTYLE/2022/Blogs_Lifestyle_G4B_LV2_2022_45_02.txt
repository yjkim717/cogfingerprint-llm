**The Unexpected Bite of Homeownership**

2022 felt like a year of big leaps, didn’t it? For me, it meant finally taking the plunge and buying my first property – a tiny little cottage just outside of town. It was everything I’d dreamed of, a fresh start, a place to build a life. 

But dreams don’t always come without a little… surprise. Just last month, I got hit with an extension fee on my mortgage. It felt like a slap in the face, a reminder that owning a home isn’t always the fairytale it seems. 

Honestly, it made me think about the whole process – the rate lock, the potential for fluctuating interest rates. It’s a lot to navigate!  Right now, I'm weighing my options, trying to figure out the safest path forward.  It’s a good lesson in understanding the real costs of building a home, and a reminder that sometimes, the best investments are the ones that teach us a little something about ourselves.
