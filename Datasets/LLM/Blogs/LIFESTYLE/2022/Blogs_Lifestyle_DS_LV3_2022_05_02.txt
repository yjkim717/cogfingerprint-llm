It was supposed to be my great escape. After a long day in 2022, I’d sink into my chair, fire up Elden Ring on my PC, and prepare to get lost in The Lands Between. But then, a bizarre pattern emerged. Every time I’d casually shift in my seat or set my PS5 controller down on the desk, the entire game would seize up. For five, ten, sometimes thirty agonizing seconds, my screen would freeze solid.

I felt like I was being haunted by a ghost—a ghost that lived inside the controller's motion sensor. My peaceful gaming sanctuary had become a minefield. I found myself moving in slow, deliberate motions, terrified that the slightest jiggle would plunge my world back into digital molasses. It was a strange lesson in how the smallest, most unexpected piece of technology could completely dictate the rhythm of my relaxation, turning a quest for calm into a masterclass in patience.
