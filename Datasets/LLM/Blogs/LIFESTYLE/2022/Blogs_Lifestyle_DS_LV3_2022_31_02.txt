The moment I saw the adoption papers signed, a wave of conflicting emotions washed over me. My first foster bunny, a timid little soul who’d learned to trust again in our home, was heading to a wonderful forever family. The joy was immense, knowing he was so loved. But as I packed his favorite toys, my heart ached. This is the bittersweet reality of fostering they don’t always talk about—you pour your whole heart into healing an animal, creating a deep emotional bond, only to have to say goodbye. It’s a special kind of heartbreak, but one I’d choose again in a heartbeat for the happy ending.
