**The Great Car Seat Quest of ‘22**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of big decisions, and figuring out our family car was right up there. We desperately needed an SUV – the kids were growing like weeds, and the minivan just wasn’t in the budget.  We were hunting for something roomy, something that would actually *fit* the car seats without a major Tetris game every time we got in.

We seriously considered the Mazda CX-5 – it looked gorgeous and the reviews were fantastic. But then we started wrestling with those car seats, and it just wasn’t working. It felt cramped, and I kept picturing a chaotic morning commute. 

It was a surprisingly emotional process!  It really highlighted how important space and comfort are for our family’s daily life.  Ultimately, we moved on, and I’m still searching for *the one* – the SUV that makes getting out the door feel, well, a little less stressful.  Anyone else been through this?
