## The Shifting Signal & Staying Grounded

It's funny how tech glitches can trigger bigger reflections. My Samsung S9, bless its heart, has been dropping its signal lately – a frustrating dance of no bars on Verizon. It got me thinking about how much we rely on constant connection. Back in 2016, this phone felt futuristic! Now, it’s a reminder that even the best tech has a lifespan. 

And honestly, maybe a little disconnection isn’t so bad. I've been trying to put the phone down more, rediscover local hikes, and *really* be present. A patchy signal just pushed me towards that a little faster. Anyone else finding solace in a little digital quiet?



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
