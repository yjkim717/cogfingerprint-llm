### The Soundtrack to My Re-Entry

It’s 2022, and the world is tentatively opening up again. After two years of quiet, the buzz of a crowd feels both foreign and electric. I’m not the same person I was in 2019, and I’ve been thinking a lot about the artifacts that got me through—namely, my old My Chemical Romance albums.

While waiting for their reunion tour, I fell down a rabbit hole of old interviews, especially from *The Black Parade* era. I was struck by how their discussions about ambition, burnout, and creating something meaningful resonated with my own post-lockdown life. Revisiting those conversations felt like getting advice from an old friend who just *gets it*.

It’s funny how the music you love as a teenager becomes a different kind of comfort as an adult. Now, their anthems aren’t just a rebellion; they’re a reminder that it’s okay to rebuild, to be dramatic about your feelings, and to find your parade again, even if it’s a little weathered.
