"As I walked across the University of Florida campus near Shands in 2022, I spotted a lost corgi mix wandering around. The black and white dog looked so out of place among the bustling hospital grounds. I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy. I quickly took to social media to spread the word, hoping to reunite this sweet pup with its owner. It was a small act, but it reminded me of the kindness that can be found in everyday moments."
