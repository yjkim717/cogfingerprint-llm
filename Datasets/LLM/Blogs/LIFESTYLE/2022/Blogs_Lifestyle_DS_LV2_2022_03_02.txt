For years, my morning ritual was non-negotiable: a scalding mug of black coffee. But by 2022, the jitters were winning. On a whim, I bought a robust loose-leaf black tea. That first steep was a revelation—a deep, malty flavor that delivered a clean, steady focus coffee never could. My kettle sings a different tune now. I’ve traded the frantic buzz for a strong, centered start, all for under a buck fifty a cup. Some swaps just feel like an upgrade.
