### The Day My GPS Told Me to Turn Right

It was a Tuesday in the fall of 2022, the kind of morning that felt photocopied from the one before. Same lukewarm coffee. Same podcast playing through my car’s speakers. Same soul-crushing crawl along the expressway, a lonely island in a sea of red brake lights.

I’d been thinking a lot about carpooling, about fuel costs and the sheer insanity of a thousand metal boxes, each carrying one person, all heading to the same few city blocks. It felt like a math problem everyone had given up on solving.

Then, my GPS did something weird. A major accident had turned my usual route into a parking lot, and it rerouted me down a street I’d never taken. I passed a bustling bus stop, a line of people chatting instead of staring blankly through windshields. A little further on, I saw one of those new, data-driven coach services picking up a group of people from a designated spot. They climbed aboard, some laughing, most just looking… relaxed.

And it hit me, right there in my solitary cockpit: I wasn’t just trying to save money on gas or shave ten minutes off my commute. I was craving connection. The last few years had left us all a little untethered, our routines built around avoiding each other. But here was a solution that wasn't just about route optimization; it was about people optimization.

What if my car wasn’t just a capsule, but a conduit? What if that empty passenger seat was an opportunity for a conversation, a shared laugh about the terrible traffic, or just the quiet comfort of not being alone in the grind?

I haven’t solved the city’s transportation crisis. But I did something different the next week. I used an app and found a neighbor with a similar schedule. Now, my morning drive has a co-pilot. We split the cost, yes, but more importantly, we’ve split the monotony. It turns out the most direct route to a better day wasn't on any map; it was right there, in the seat next to me.
