As a UCDavis student in 2022, I was thrilled to discover the equitable access program for textbooks. For multiple classes, I could now access required course materials digitally, at a lower cost. This flexibility was a game-changer, allowing me to focus on learning rather than budgeting. By embracing equitable access, I reclaimed time and money, enhancing my overall college experience.
