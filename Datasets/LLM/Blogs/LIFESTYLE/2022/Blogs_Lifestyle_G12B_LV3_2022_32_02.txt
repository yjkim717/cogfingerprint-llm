## The Grind & The Glow-Up: Finding Balance in Epic Seven (and Life!)

Okay, real talk. Anyone else spending a *little* too much time staring at their phone these days? Lately, it's been mostly Epic Seven. I’m chasing those elusive 1 million+ expedition scores, and let me tell you, it’s become a surprisingly meditative (and occasionally frustrating!) pursuit.

I've been tinkering with my expedition teams, trying to find the perfect synergy. It's made me realize something though – optimizing my *life* feels a lot like optimizing a team. You need the right mix of skills, a little patience, and a willingness to adjust your strategy when things aren't working. 

Anyone else find their gaming habits reflecting their broader life goals? Share your Epic Seven team comps (and life hacks!) in the comments – maybe we can all level up together!
