It’s 2022, and I’m in the thick of another IBS flare-up—cramping, bloating, the works. Starting the low FODMAP diet felt overwhelming, like learning a new language overnight. But I’m holding onto hope that cutting out certain foods, along with adding probiotics and my doctor’s guidance, will bring relief. Some days are discouraging, but I’m taking it one meal at a time, trusting my body will find its balance again. You’re not alone in this journey.
