## The Quiet Echo of Empty Lettuce Bowls

It’s officially November 2022, and the air smells like woodsmoke and impending holidays. Lately, though, my heart feels a little…hollow. Last week, Pip, the foster rabbit I’d been caring for, found his forever home. A lovely couple with a sprawling garden and a promise of endless dandelion greens. I’m genuinely thrilled for him. He deserves a life bursting with sunshine and clover.

But oh, the quiet! My apartment feels vast without the thump-thump of his little feet, the rustle of hay, the frantic munching. I keep catching myself reaching for the lettuce, then remembering there’s no one to offer it to. It’s a weird, unexpected emotional mess, this feeling of missing a creature so small. 

It’s a good reminder, I think, that even temporary connections can leave a lasting imprint. That joy and sadness can exist side-by-side, intertwined like the roots of a carrot. And maybe, just maybe, it's okay to feel a little bit empty while celebrating someone else's full life.
