**The Day My Computer Died (and Maybe Me Too?)**

Okay, so 2022 was… a lot. Between work, trying to learn sourdough, and generally feeling like I was perpetually juggling, my tech life felt increasingly fragile. Last month, I was wrestling with a ridiculously frustrating freeze in Firefox on my openSUSE Leap. It just… stopped. A complete freeze.  

It took a full power cycle to get it working again, and honestly, it felt like a tiny, dramatic metaphor for how overwhelmed I was.  Like the system was mirroring my own feeling of being stuck.  It made me realize I needed to simplify, to step back.  Maybe a less demanding browser, and definitely less sourdough!  Sometimes, a digital crash is a surprisingly good reminder to prioritize real life.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, add a specific detail, or change the length)?
