As I navigated my Erasmus journey in 2022, I realized that choosing the right destination was crucial. As a computer engineering student from Spain, I wanted a place where I'd feel at home and language wouldn't be a barrier. I found that European destinations like Sweden and the Netherlands were perfect - not only did they have top-notch universities, but the locals were also comfortable speaking English. I adapted quickly, and before I knew it, I'd settled into a new lifestyle, making the most of my study abroad experience.
