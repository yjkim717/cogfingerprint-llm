**The Quiet Shift**

It feels a little strange writing this, acknowledging a shift I’ve been noticing in my own life, and seeing it mirrored in the quiet struggles of others. 2022 – we’re still figuring things out, aren’t we?  The pandemic’s shadow is *long*, and it’s not just about lockdowns anymore. It’s about the way it’s subtly reshaped how we connect.

I’ve been thinking a lot about my nephew, Liam. He’s twelve, a bright kid who used to practically *live* for soccer and hanging out with friends. Lately, though, there’s been this… withdrawal. He’s pushing back on activities, saying he’s just “tired,” which, honestly, feels like a really careful way of saying he’s overwhelmed. 

It’s heartbreaking to watch, especially knowing the restrictions he experienced growing up, the lost opportunities for building those crucial social connections. It’s like a little piece of his confidence has been chipped away, compounded by a feeling that maybe, just maybe, he’s not quite measuring up. 

I think we’re seeing this in a lot of kids – a heightened sense of inadequacy fueled by a world that’s felt so uncertain. We need to be more intentional about creating safe spaces, encouraging small connections, and reminding them that it’s okay to not be okay.  Maybe the biggest activity of all is simply being present and listening.

Would you like me to revise this in any way, or perhaps explore a slightly different angle?
