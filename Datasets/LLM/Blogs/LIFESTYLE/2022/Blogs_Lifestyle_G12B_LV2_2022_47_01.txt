## The Weight of "Someday" and the Power of Tiny Steps

It’s November 2022, and the air has that crisp, anticipatory feel. The holidays are looming, and with them, that familiar pressure to *do* something, *be* something… better. It’s a feeling I think a lot of us grapple with, especially as the year winds down and we inevitably start reflecting.

For years, I lived with a sprawling to-do list tucked away in the back of my mind, a list brimming with ambitious goals. Learn Italian. Write a novel. Finally organize that overflowing closet. Become a sourdough baking *maestro*. The list went on and on, a testament to all the things I *wanted* to be, all the things I *should* be doing.

But the list remained largely untouched. It felt… overwhelming. Like climbing Everest in flip-flops. The sheer scale of it paralyzed me. And so, I’d tell myself, "Someday. Someday I’ll have the time. Someday I’ll have the energy. Someday I’ll *finally* get around to it."

"Someday" became a comfortable excuse. A warm, fuzzy blanket of inaction.

This year, though, something shifted. I don’t know exactly *what* triggered it – maybe it was the relentless pace of 2022, the constant news cycle, or just a growing weariness with the inertia. But I realized that “someday” wasn’t coming. Someday was a mirage.

I stumbled across a quote recently – I can’t remember where I saw it – that said something like, “The secret to getting things done is to stop thinking about getting things done and start *doing* something.” It wasn't a revolutionary idea, but it landed with a surprising thud.

I started small. *Really* small. Instead of tackling the entire closet, I dedicated 15 minutes to sorting through one shelf. Instead of signing up for an intensive Italian course, I downloaded Duolingo and did one lesson a day. Instead of writing a chapter of the novel, I wrote one paragraph.

It felt… insignificant. Almost silly. Like I was barely making a dent. And honestly, for the first few weeks, I questioned if it was even worth it. Was I just delaying the inevitable, tricking myself into feeling productive while accomplishing nothing substantial?

But then, something remarkable happened. Those tiny actions started to accumulate. That one shelf became two. The Duolingo lessons started to feel less like a chore and more like a little victory. That single paragraph blossomed into a page, then two.

And the weight… the weight of "someday" started to lift.

It wasn't about achieving those grand, ambitious goals overnight. It was about establishing a *habit*. It was about proving to myself that I *could* take action, even when
