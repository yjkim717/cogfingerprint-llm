"I've been feeling stuck in my financial groove lately. I recently opened an Amex card, thinking it'd be a great way to earn rewards on my work purchases. However, with the rising costs of living in 2022, I'm realizing it's not the best fit for my current financial situation. I'm considering closing it, but I'm worried about the potential impact on my credit score. Should I bite the bullet and close it ASAP, or is it better to keep it open and risk accumulating more debt? I'm torn between convenience and financial responsibility."
