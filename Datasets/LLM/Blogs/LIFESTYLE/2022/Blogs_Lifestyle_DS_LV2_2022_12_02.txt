There’s something about Willem Dafoe’s intensity that makes me want to revisit my own passions. In 2022, I realized I’d been letting my favorite hobbies—like painting and hiking—slip away, just like I’d missed some of his best films. It’s funny how an actor’s dedication can remind you to recommit to what you love. So, I’m dusting off my easel and planning a trail for the weekend. Sometimes, the best inspiration comes from the stories we watch, pushing us to live our own more fully.
