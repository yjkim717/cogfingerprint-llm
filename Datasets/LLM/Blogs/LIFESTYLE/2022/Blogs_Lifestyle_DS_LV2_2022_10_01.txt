It’s another Tuesday, and I’m scrolling through #TalentTuesday posts from my sober community—the #sobernauts. Two years ago, I wouldn’t have believed I’d be here, celebrating small wins and rediscovering old passions. Sobriety didn’t just clear my head; it gave me back my hands, my creativity.

Today, I sketched for the first time in a decade. It’s messy, but it’s mine. In recovery, I’ve learned it’s not about being perfect—it’s about being present. And as I share my progress with friends who just *get it*, I’m reminded: we’re not just staying sober, we’re building lives worth living. #IWNDBICSWYT
