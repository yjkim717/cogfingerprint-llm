## The Fourth of July and the Art of Saying "No" (Sometimes)

Okay, let's be real. Anyone else feel like 2022 was *peak* holiday chaos? I just wrapped up a Fourth of July weekend working in the meat department at my local grocery store, and wow. It was… a lot. 

It wasn't the grilling crowds that got to me, though. It was the special requests. *So. Many. Special. Requests.* "Can you butterfly this, then trim this, then grind it *just so*?" "Do you have organic, free-range, grass-fed, bone-in, pre-seasoned ribs?" Seriously, folks! 

It made me think about boundaries, you know? Not just at work, but in life. We often feel pressured to say "yes" to everything, to accommodate every whim. But sometimes, saying "no" – even politely – is essential for your own sanity. It's about protecting your energy and remembering that you don't have to be everything to everyone, especially when you're already navigating a busy holiday weekend. Anyone else relate?
