As I fired up my openSUSE Leap desktop in 2022, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. That was until I opened Firefox and my system froze. Again. It was like a bad habit I couldn't shake. I couldn't help but wonder, was it just a glitch or a sign that it was time to reevaluate my digital lifestyle? I reflected on my daily routine and realized that it was time to take a step back, reassess my priorities, and reboot not just my system, but my entire digital life.
