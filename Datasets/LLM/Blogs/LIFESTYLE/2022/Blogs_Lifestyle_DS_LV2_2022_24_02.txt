It’s 2022, and I’m flipping through cooking shows again, hoping for something different. Another celebrity chef just made a beautiful jackfruit taco, raving about its texture and flavor. For a moment, I felt seen. But then—bam—the very next segment is a sizzling steak, dripping with juices.

My heart sinks every time. It feels like veganism is just a trendy box to tick, a brief, disingenuous nod before returning to the “real” food. Where’s the commitment? The genuine curiosity? I want chefs to explore plant-based cooking not as a fleeting experiment, but as a meaningful part of the culinary world. Because for me, and millions like me, it’s not a phase—it’s our life, our plate, every single day.
