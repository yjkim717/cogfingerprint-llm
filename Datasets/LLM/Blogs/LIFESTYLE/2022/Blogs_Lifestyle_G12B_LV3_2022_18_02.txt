## The Quiet Terror of Audio Drama

It's 2022, and I've found myself utterly captivated by audio dramas lately. There's something uniquely unsettling about a well-crafted horror story told only through sound. I recently stumbled upon a Reddit thread where someone was seeking recommendations – they loved *Tribulation* and *Video Palace*, and those are absolute gold standards! It got me thinking about how immersive and genuinely chilling these productions can be, and how they’ve become a perfect, cozy-yet-terrifying escape.
