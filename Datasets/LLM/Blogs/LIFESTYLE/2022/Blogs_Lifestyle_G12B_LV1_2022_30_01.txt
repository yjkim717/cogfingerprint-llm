## The Ghosts in the Prints: Why I’m Still Obsessed with Polaroid

Rewatching *Mad Men* recently, there it was - a Polaroid camera, casually sitting on Don Draper’s desk. It was such a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, but it sparked something in me. It reminded me of my own trusty, slightly battered Land Camera 360, a relic from my grandfather that I inherited a few years back.

It’s not a practical thing, let’s be honest. In 2022, when I can snap a hundred photos with my phone in seconds, the Polaroid feels delightfully, stubbornly *slow*. The whole process is a ritual. Loading the peel-apart film (which, let's be real, is increasingly difficult to find!), carefully composing the shot, the whirring of the gears, the agonizing wait… and then, the magic.

That first glimpse of the image slowly emerging from the developing goo is still a thrill. It's imperfect, often blurry, the colors a little off – but that's *part* of the charm. It’s a tangible memory, a little square of time frozen and held in your hand.

I've tried to explain it to friends who are all about instant digital gratification. They just don’t *get* it. But there's something so grounding about the physicality of it all.  It forces you to be present, to really *see* the moment you're capturing.  It's a pause button in a world that's constantly speeding up.

Maybe it’s a nostalgia thing, a longing for a simpler time. Or maybe it's just the beautiful imperfection of it all. Either way, my Polaroid isn’t going anywhere. It’s a reminder to slow down, appreciate the little moments, and embrace the ghosts captured in those faded, square prints.
