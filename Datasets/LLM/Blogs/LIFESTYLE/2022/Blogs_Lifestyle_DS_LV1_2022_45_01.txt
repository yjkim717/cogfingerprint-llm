When my husband and I filed jointly for the first time in 2022, we realized our combined income had pushed us over the Roth IRA limit—and I’d already maxed mine out. That heart-sinking moment taught us that marriage merges more than hearts; it blends finances, too. We navigated a "backdoor Roth" to fix it, but the lesson stuck: communication is key, in love and money. Now, we plan together, avoiding surprises and strengthening our partnership along the way.
