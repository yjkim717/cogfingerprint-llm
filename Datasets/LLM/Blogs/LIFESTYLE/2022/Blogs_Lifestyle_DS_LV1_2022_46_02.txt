The hum of my 3D printer is the soundtrack to my projects, but it used to hit a frustrating snag. I love embedding nuts into my prints, which requires a perfectly timed pause. Using Klipper on a Raspberry Pi, I’d insert the `PAUSE` command in my G-code, but I had to constantly watch the machine, afraid I’d miss the cue. I needed a clear signal—a beacon for my attention. My quest wasn't for a quieter fan or a faster print, but for a smarter way to bridge the gap between the digital instructions and my necessary, human touch.
