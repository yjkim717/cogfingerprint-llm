Title: "Steeping into Simplicity: Lessons from a Coffee Lover"

As I sipped my morning coffee on a lazy 2022 Sunday, I couldn't help but think about the intricate process that brought it to my cup. The coffee beans, ground to perfection, steeped in hot water, releasing their rich flavors. It struck me that this simple pleasure is, in fact, a complex mass transfer process. The solvent, water, extracts the desired compounds from the coffee grounds, much like a packed bed extraction process. As I reflected on this, I realized that my own life is a complex extraction process too. I'm constantly seeking to extract meaning, joy, and connection from the world around me. Just as the right solvent and conditions are crucial for a successful extraction, I've learned to be intentional about creating space for what truly nourishes my mind, body, and soul.
