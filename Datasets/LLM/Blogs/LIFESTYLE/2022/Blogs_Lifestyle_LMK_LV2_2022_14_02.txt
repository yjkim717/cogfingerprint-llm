**Staying on Track: How I Survived the Chaos of Travel and Training in 2022**

As I sit here reflecting on the past year, I'm reminded of the countless times I've found myself jetting off to a new city, only to be swallowed up by a whirlwind of meetings, presentations, and long, grueling days. As an ultrarunner, I'm no stranger to pushing my body to its limits, but the added challenge of maintaining my training on the road can be daunting.

In 2022, I traveled extensively for work, crisscrossing the globe and accumulating a staggering number of frequent flyer miles. As exciting as it was to explore new destinations, it was a real test of my resolve to stick to my training regimen. With exhausting days filled with back-to-back meetings and presentations, it would have been easy to let my fitness routine fall by the wayside.

But I'm stubborn, and I've learned that with a bit of creativity and planning, it's entirely possible to stay on track, even in the most challenging of circumstances. I recall one particularly grueling trip to Tokyo, where I had a jam-packed schedule and barely had time to breathe. I managed to squeeze in a few laps around the hotel's block, using the neon-lit streets to fuel my run as much as my weary legs.

Other times, I'd seek out local running groups or hit the pavement with a portable fitness app, using the unfamiliar terrain to my advantage. I'd explore new neighborhoods, taking in the sights and sounds while logging my miles. It was a great way to experience a new city, and it helped me stay connected to my running community, even when I was thousands of miles away.

Of course, there were days when even I had to admit defeat â€“ when a 6 am meeting or a marathon flight made it impossible to fit in a run. But I've learned to be kind to myself, to roll with the punches, and to prioritize my recovery.

As I look back on the past year, I'm proud of how I've managed to balance my love of running with the demands of my travel schedule. If you're facing a similar challenge, I hope my experiences will inspire you to stay on track, even when the going gets tough.
