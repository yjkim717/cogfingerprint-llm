**The Weight of the Watch**

Okay, let’s be honest. 2022 felt… heavy, didn’t it? A lot of us were just trying to navigate a world that felt perpetually on the edge. And for me, a weird, creeping anxiety started to build around something I knew was contributing: porn. 

I’m not talking about a casual glance. It became a regular habit, a way to… well, I don't even really want to admit *why*.  I started obsessing over erections – not in a healthy, curious way, but with this insistent, critical voice in my head.  It was all tied up with this ridiculous, impossible standard of performance, thanks to what I was watching. 

Suddenly, my own erections felt… inadequate.  And it spiraled.  I started worrying about my ‘dick size’ (seriously?!), comparing myself to these incredibly unrealistic, digitally enhanced images.  It was fueling a massive performance anxiety that bled into *everything*.  

It’s strange, because I’m a pretty open person about sexuality. But this felt like a secret shame, a little corner of my life I was desperately trying to control.  I realized I was sacrificing genuine connection and enjoyment for a fleeting, manufactured fantasy. 

Cutting back wasn't easy, and it definitely involved some tough conversations with myself. But slowly, I started to notice a shift.  Focusing on real intimacy, on appreciating the present moment, helped to quiet that critical voice. It's a process, but reclaiming my attention and my own body feels incredibly liberating.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
