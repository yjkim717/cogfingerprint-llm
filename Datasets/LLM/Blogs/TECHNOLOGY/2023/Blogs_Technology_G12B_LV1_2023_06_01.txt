## The Hum of the Old Machine

There's something comforting about the analog feel of older tech, isn't there? I recently dusted off my ancient iPod Classic – a relic from 2007 – and the click-wheel felt surprisingly… good. In a world of seamless swipes and endless notifications, that deliberate action, that *hum* of the hard drive, felt grounding. Maybe it's nostalgia, but I miss the focused simplicity. It’s a reminder that progress isn’t always about more, but sometimes about appreciating what *was*.
