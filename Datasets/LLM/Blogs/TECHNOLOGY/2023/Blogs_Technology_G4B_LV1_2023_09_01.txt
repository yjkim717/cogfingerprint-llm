**The Endless Capture Race**

Remember obsessing over Gun of Boom’s “capture the object” mode back in 2013? It felt like a frantic sprint – a constant, agonizing battle. Lately, I’ve been thinking about that feeling. It’s weird, isn’t it? How even with the best tech, some games just feel rigged. You could build a huge lead, but a single, lucky shot could snatch victory away. It’s a frustrating reminder that winning isn't always about skill, sometimes it’s just about luck.
