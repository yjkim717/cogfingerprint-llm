"My Smartphone Surgery: How Tech Helped Me Through Pre-Op Anxiety"

As I sat in my dimly lit room, surrounded by the glow of screens, I couldn't shake off the knot in my stomach. I was just a day away from a minor surgery to remove a cyst, and my mind was racing with worst-case scenarios. In 2023, it's crazy to think that I'd turn to my smartphone for comfort, but that's exactly what I did. I downloaded a meditation app and spent the evening practicing deep breathing exercises. I also joined an online forum where people shared their own experiences with similar surgeries. The sense of community was reassuring. As I drifted off to sleep, I felt more prepared to face the unknown. My smartphone, once a source of stress, had become a lifeline, helping me cope with pre-op anxiety. It was a surprising, yet welcome, surgery buddy.
