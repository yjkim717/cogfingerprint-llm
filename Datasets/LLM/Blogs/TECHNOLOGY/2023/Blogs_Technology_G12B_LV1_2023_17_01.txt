## The Unexpected Adventures of Backing Up to USB (and Learning a Lot Along the Way)

So, I’ve been on a mission. A simple mission, really: automatically back up my home lab to a couple of USB drives. Sounds straightforward, right? Famous last words. 

It started innocently enough with Restic – a fantastic tool, by the way, and highly recommended. Setting up the initial repository was a breeze. But automating the whole process, especially involving those pesky USB drives, proved to be… a journey.

My first attempt involved blindly adding entries to `/etc/fstab`. Let's just say that didn’t end well. A cascading series of errors, a frantic Google search, and a few choice words later, I realized that blindly mounting everything wasn’t the clever solution I thought it was.  Learning about the `mount -a` command and its potential pitfalls was a key moment. It's powerful, but needs respect!

Honestly, the whole experience was a good reminder that even seemingly simple automation projects can throw curveballs. It forced me to really understand *how* my system mounts drives and the importance of robust error handling. 

Now, things are (mostly) stable. My backups run nightly, and I sleep a little easier knowing my data is a little safer. Plus, I’ve got a newfound appreciation for the intricacies of Linux mounting – something I wouldn't have learned without a bit of trial (and a lot of error) along the way.  Anyone else have a similar "simple project, unexpected learning curve" experience?
