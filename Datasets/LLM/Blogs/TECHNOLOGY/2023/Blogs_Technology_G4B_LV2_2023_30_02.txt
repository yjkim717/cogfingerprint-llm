**Dreaming in Code: My Tech Future and the Visa Question**

Okay, let’s be real – 2023 feels like a year of big questions, right? For me, a lot of it boils down to tech and the future. I’ve been seriously considering applying to Cornell Tech’s CS/ME program – the idea of diving into that kind of innovation is seriously exciting. 

But then there's the H1B visa thing. It’s a constant, quiet worry in the back of my mind.  It’s not just about the program itself; it’s about building a career I’m passionate about *and* figuring out how to make it work long-term. 

It makes you wonder, doesn’t it? How do we balance ambition with practicality? How do we build a future we truly want, while also navigating the complexities of the world around us?  I'm definitely still figuring it out, and honestly, that’s part of the adventure.
