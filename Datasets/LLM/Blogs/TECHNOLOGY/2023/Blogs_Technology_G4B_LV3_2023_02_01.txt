**The Silent Anxiety of the Digital Bill**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We trust technology, rely on it for *everything*. But sometimes, that trust feels…fragile. I recently had a frustrating experience with a telecom, and it really got me thinking about the hidden anxieties of the digital world. 

I was hit with a completely unexpected bill – the full price of my phone, despite seeing confirmation screens saying otherwise. No easy cancellation options, and customer service felt like pulling teeth. It’s a small thing, sure, but it sparked a bigger worry: how often do we just accept digital transactions without really *understanding* them?  It’s a reminder that even in 2023, navigating the tech landscape can feel a little unsettling.
