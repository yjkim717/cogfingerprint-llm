**The Scroll & The Judgment: Why Do We Obsess Over Other People’s Relationships?**

Let’s be honest, scrolling through social media in 2023 feels… exhausting. And a *lot* of it centers around relationships. We’re bombarded with wedding photos, anniversary posts, and, let’s face it, a surprising amount of commentary on who people are *choosing* to be with. 

I’ve noticed a particular pattern lately – a wave of women online dissecting men’s partner choices, often with a distinctly critical tone. It feels, frankly, a little juvenile. Like we’ve collectively decided that anyone who dares to be in a relationship with someone different – whether it’s an age gap or a different gender – is somehow doing it wrong. 

It’s easy to judge from a distance, isn’t it? We curate our own highlight reels, showcasing the ‘perfect’ moments while conveniently omitting the messy bits. But relationships aren’t highlight reels. They’re messy, complicated, and built on individual preferences that *nobody* is entitled to dictate. 

I think this online behavior speaks to a deeper need for validation. We’re seeking reassurance that *our* choices are ‘good’ by measuring them against an often unrealistic standard.  Instead of fueling that need, maybe we should focus on cultivating a little more empathy and acceptance.  Mutual respect for individual journeys – even if they don’t align with our own – feels like a much healthier way to navigate this digital landscape. 

What are your thoughts? Do you ever find yourself caught in the cycle of online relationship critiques?
