As a Shopify merchant in Slovenia, I've struggled to find a payment processor that caters to Europe's diverse payment landscape. In 2023, it's surprising that seamless transactions still aren't a given. I'm on the hunt for a reliable solution that supports Klarna and Bancontact, making it easy for my customers to pay. Has anyone else faced this challenge, and what's your go-to payment processor for a frictionless checkout experience?
