## The Algorithm and the Aches

It's weird, isn’t it? How technology, designed to connect and streamline, can sometimes amplify the quiet anxieties humming beneath the surface. I’m 23, and I’ve been spending a lot of time lately thinking about… well, not the fun stuff. I’m facing a minor surgery next week – a cyst removal – and it’s somehow triggered this whole cascade of existential dread. 

Suddenly, the endless scroll of social media feels less like connection and more like a relentless reminder of everyone else’s seemingly perfect, healthy lives.  I catch myself doomscrolling health forums, a terrible habit, feeding the fear and convincing myself every twinge is a sign of something awful. It’s ironic. We have access to instant information, a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips, yet I’m using it to fuel my own anxiety.

I’m trying to be better.  Putting the phone down, actually *living* in the moment, even if the moment is terrifying.  It's a conscious effort to disconnect from the digital echo chamber and reconnect with…reality.  This surgery, this potential health scare, it’s a stark reminder that life is fragile, and that a lot of what I worry about exists only in the curated spaces of the internet.  Maybe that’s the biggest lesson of 2023 so far: learn to log off, and breathe.




Hope this fits your needs! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
