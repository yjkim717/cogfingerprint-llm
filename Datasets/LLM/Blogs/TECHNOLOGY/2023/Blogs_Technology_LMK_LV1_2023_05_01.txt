"As I eagerly awaited the ICLR 2023 response, I found myself pondering a crucial question: how much can I change my paper in the camera-ready version? With my paper accepted, I was excited to refine it based on the meta-reviews. But how much is too much? I dug into the guidelines and discovered that while some tweaks are allowed, major changes aren't. It's a delicate balance between incorporating valuable feedback and maintaining the original work's integrity. As a machine learning researcher, I've learned that this dance between revision and preservation is a crucial part of the publication process."
