Remember that frantic rush to upgrade your alchemy cauldron in Idleon? I felt that same pressure in 2023, trying to keep up with every new AI tool. The promise of a "2x brew" for productivity was intoxicating. But chasing speed left me drained, my creative cauldron nearly empty. I've learned that true progress isn't about the fastest boost; it's sustainable, mindful crafting. Sometimes, the best upgrade is knowing when to step back and let your ideas simmer.
