The blinking cursor on my screen felt like a metronome counting down to my surgery next week. I’d been doom-scrolling through medical forums, my anxiety spiraling with every worst-case scenario. My phone, usually a portal to endless distraction, had become a prison of my own health-related fears.

In a moment of desperation, I closed all the tabs and opened a meditation app I’d downloaded months ago and ignored. I put on my noise-canceling headphones, and for ten minutes, I just focused on my breath. The frantic thoughts about cysts and mortality didn't vanish, but they lost their sharp, terrifying edge. They became just… thoughts.

It was a profound reminder in our hyper-connected 2023 world: the same technology that can amplify our anxieties also holds the tools to quiet them. The challenge isn't to disconnect entirely, but to consciously choose which digital doors we open. That small, intentional act of seeking calm in the chaos didn't cure my fear, but it gave me the one thing I needed most—a way to cope.
