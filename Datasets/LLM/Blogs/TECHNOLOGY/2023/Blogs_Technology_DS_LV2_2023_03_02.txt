**My Unexpected Digital Reset**

I’ll admit it—I started 2023 feeling completely burnt out. My phone was a constant source of noise, and my laptop felt like a chain to an endless to-do list. I was scrolling mindlessly, my focus shattered.

Then, on a whim, I decided to get intentional. I turned off all non-essential notifications and started using my phone’s "Focus Mode" during work blocks. It felt strange at first, almost like a digital detox.

But a quiet miracle happened. The silence wasn’t empty; it was spacious. Without the constant pings, my mind finally settled. I finished projects faster and, more importantly, started reading actual books again in the evenings.

It’s funny. I used technology to create a barrier against technology itself. This small, mindful shift didn’t just reclaim my time; it gave me back my attention and a much-needed sense of calm in a noisy year. Turns out, the best feature isn't an app—it's the "off" switch.
