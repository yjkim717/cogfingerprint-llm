It was late 2023 when I thought I’d found the perfect rent-stabilized apartment through a broker. I submitted my bid, feeling hopeful. Then came the email: another applicant had offered a higher broker fee, and I was asked to match it. Suddenly, the promise of stability felt like a high-stakes auction. It struck me how technology—those instant alerts and digital bidding—had turned housing into a frantic, impersonal race. The very tools meant to connect us were deepening the divide, leaving dreams just out of reach.
