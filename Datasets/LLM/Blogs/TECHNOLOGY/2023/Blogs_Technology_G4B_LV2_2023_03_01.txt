**The Scroll & The Judgment: Why Are We So Obsessed with Other People's Relationships?**

Let’s be honest, scrolling through social media in 2023 feels… a little intense, doesn't it? We’re bombarded with curated lives, highlight reels, and enough opinions to fill a library. And lately, I’ve noticed a particular trend that’s been sticking with me: the online critique of other people’s relationships.

Specifically, it seems women are increasingly vocal about criticizing men's choices when it comes to their partners – often labeling it as “immature” and a contributor to unhealthy dynamics. It’s not a new thing, of course, but the sheer volume of it feels… different. 

I was thinking about this the other day, looking at a friend’s Instagram feed, and I realized I was almost *expecting* to see a comment or two about a recent relationship post. It felt like a competition, a little performance of disapproval. It made me uncomfortable. 

I get it, on some level. We *want* healthy relationships. We want people to be happy. But is policing someone else’s love life actually helping, or is it just feeding a cycle of negativity? 

I think a lot of it comes down to feeling a little insecure about our own relationships, or perhaps a desire to project our own values onto others. But honestly, judging someone else's partner – especially without knowing the full story – feels a bit…toxic. 

It's easy to offer advice from a distance, but relationships are messy, complicated, and deeply personal.  Maybe instead of scrolling and judging, we could try a little empathy.  Maybe instead of adding to the noise, we could offer genuine support to those we care about. 

What do you think? Am I reading too much into this, or is there a bigger conversation happening here about how we use technology to connect – and sometimes, to dissect – each other’s lives?
