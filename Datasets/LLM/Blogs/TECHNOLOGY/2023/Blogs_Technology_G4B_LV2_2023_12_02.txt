**The Pipe That Made Me Think**

Okay, Elixir folks, let me confess something. I was wrestling with a simple arithmetic function the other day, and suddenly, the pipe operator felt…wrong. Like I was forcing it. It’s funny how deeply we internalize patterns, right?  I was clinging to a specific argument position, stubbornly ignoring the elegant multi-parametric pipe approach. 

It really made me think about *why* we use pipes – not just as a shortcut, but as a way to visually represent a flow of logic. Sometimes, the most beautiful solutions are the ones that feel the most natural.  Anyone else have a “pipe moment” lately?
