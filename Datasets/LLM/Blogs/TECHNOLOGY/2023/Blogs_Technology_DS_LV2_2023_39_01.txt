It’s funny how a tiny Chrome extension can become part of your daily rhythm. For years, Smooth Gestures Plus was my silent partner—a flick of the wrist closing tabs, opening new ones. Then, one day in 2023, it vanished from the Web Store. Just gone.

It left a quiet gap in my browsing, like a missing step in a familiar staircase. Now I’m hunting for alternatives, realizing how deeply these small tools weave into our digital lives. It’s a humble reminder that nothing online is truly permanent.
