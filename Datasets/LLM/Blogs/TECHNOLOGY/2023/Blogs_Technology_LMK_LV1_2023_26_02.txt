"Upgrading my mini-ITX build was a breeze, thanks to a great deal I scored online. I snagged an Intel i7-6700 processor, ASRock H110M-ITX motherboard, and 16GB DDR3 memory for a steal. Buying the combo saved me a pretty penny. Although DDR3 is older tech, it still gets the job done. If you're looking to breathe new life into an old build, I'd say check out similar deals - just be mindful of the hardware swap's limitations in today's tech landscape."
