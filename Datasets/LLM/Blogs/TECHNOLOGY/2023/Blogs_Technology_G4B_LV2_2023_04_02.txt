**The Algorithm Knows – And Does It Make Me Feel Less Like Me?**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much of our lives feels… curated now? I was scrolling through Airbnb the other day, looking for a weekend getaway, and the algorithm just *knew* exactly what I wanted. A tiny cabin in the woods, a roaring fireplace, a ridiculously good coffee machine – it was all presented within seconds. And, honestly, it felt a little unsettling.

It got me thinking about the London housing market, which, as I’ve been reading, is increasingly out of reach for so many. That feeling of being presented with a perfectly tailored, yet ultimately expensive, option – it’s a similar sensation. We’re constantly bombarded with suggestions, optimized for our perceived desires, and it’s easy to feel like we’re just data points in a giant system. 

Like with those leasehold properties and those eye-watering service charges – it’s not just about the upfront cost, is it? It’s about the *ongoing* cost of fitting into someone else’s plan. 

I used to think owning a place was the ultimate goal. But lately, I’m wondering if chasing that perfectly optimized home, driven by an algorithm’s recommendations, is actually stripping away a bit of the messy, unpredictable joy of just *being*. Maybe a little less data, and a little more spontaneity, is exactly what we need.
