As I settled into my new home in 2023, I was excited to start my remote work journey. However, I was disheartened to discover that the broadband speeds in my area were woefully inadequate. With deadlines to meet and video calls to make, slow internet was not an option. I began exploring alternative internet solutions and stumbled upon 5G wifi and MiFi devices. These portable, high-speed options have been a game-changer for me. With 5G wifi, I'm no longer tethered to a slow connection, and I can work from anywhere. The flexibility has been liberating, and I've found that I can stay productive even in areas where traditional broadband is lacking. Embracing 5G technology has not only improved my work experience but has also opened up new possibilities for remote work in rural or underserved areas, allowing me to stay connected and work seamlessly.
