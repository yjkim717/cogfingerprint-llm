"Lost in the Virtual World: My NAT Network Configuration Struggles"

As I sat staring at my screen in 2023, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over me. I was trying to set up a test environment using VMWare and Virtual Box, but I was getting stuck on configuring NAT networks. I had read the documentation, watched tutorials, and searched online forums, but I still couldn't seem to get it right.

I remembered the countless hours I had spent configuring virtual machines in the past, and how I had always taken network connectivity for granted. But now, as I struggled to get my VMs to communicate with each other, I realized that I had been naive. Configuring NAT networks is not as straightforward as it seems. I'm sharing my struggles in the hopes that it will help others avoid the same pitfalls. Let's navigate the world of virtual networking together!
