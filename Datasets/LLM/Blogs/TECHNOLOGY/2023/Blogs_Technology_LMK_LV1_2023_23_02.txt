"Is Renewing Your Copenhagen Housing Company Registration Worth the Wait?

As I sat at my desk in early 2023, staring at the renewal form for our housing company registration, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. The form was straightforward enough, but I knew that submitting it was just the beginning of a long and arduous process. You see, our company is based in Copenhagen, where the housing market is notoriously competitive, and the waiting lists for boligselskaber are notoriously long.

I started to wonder, is it really worth renewing our registration? The waiting list is years long, and I'm not convinced that our renewal will make a significant difference in our chances of securing a new unit anytime soon. As I pondered this, I realized that the real question is: what's the point of renewing if the system is so broken? Is it simply a matter of going through the motions, or is there a better way to navigate the complex world of Copenhagen's housing companies?"
