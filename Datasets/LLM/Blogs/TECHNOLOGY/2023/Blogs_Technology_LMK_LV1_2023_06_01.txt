As I glance at my trusty 2013 Mazda3, now with over 150,000 miles on it, I'm reminded that some tech stands the test of time. I've lovingly maintained this project car since purchasing it used, and it's been my reliable companion on countless adventures. With the rapid pace of tech advancements in 2023, it's refreshing to see that this Mazda3 still runs strong, a testament to its durability and my dedication to regular maintenance.
