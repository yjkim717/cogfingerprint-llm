## Lost in the Digital Woods (and Finding Healthcare!)

It's funny how reliant we are on websites these days, isn’t it? I spent a good chunk of yesterday navigating mass.gov, trying to find decent, paid health insurance options. Not MassHealth, mind you, just... regular plans. The sheer volume of information felt overwhelming! It really highlighted how technology, designed to simplify, can sometimes just create a new layer of complexity. Hopefully, I’ll emerge victorious and with coverage soon! Anyone else feel this way about online navigation?
