**Scrolling Through the Feels**

Okay, 2023 was… a lot. I spent most of the semester wrestling with imposter syndrome, honestly.  Like, staring at my med school textbooks and just feeling completely lost. Then, a random thread on Reddit – a simple “thank you” post from a classmate – completely shifted something. It reminded me I wasn’t alone in struggling.  

That small act of online gratitude sparked a wave of actually feeling *thankful* for the support system I *did* have.  It boosted my confidence in a way I hadn't expected.  Sometimes, just a little digital connection can be a huge lifeline.  What’s been your “Reddit moment” lately?
