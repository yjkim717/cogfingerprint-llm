## The Hope of a Synchronized Start

Isn’t it strange how dating has become this… asynchronous dance? We build connections online, share bits of ourselves, and then, poof, silence. Ghosting. It's a frustratingly common experience in 2023. I was reading about someone wishing for a different approach – a dating site where both people reveal their identities *at the same time*, after a certain point in conversation. 

It’s a fascinating idea! A "synchronous reveal," they called it. It feels like a little act of vulnerability, a mutual commitment that might just cut down on the disappearing acts. Maybe, just maybe, it could foster more genuine connections from the get-go. What do you think?
