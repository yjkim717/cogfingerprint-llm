It’s 2023, and I’m knee-deep in PhD applications, straddling the worlds of neuroscience and engineering. I’d spent weeks agonizing over whether to email professors before interviews—would clarifying my research interests seem eager or just pushy? In a digital age where every ping feels loaded, I worried my carefully crafted message might get lost in overflowing inboxes or misinterpreted.

Ultimately, I decided to save those nuanced conversations for the interviews themselves. There’s something irreplaceable about real-time dialogue, where passion and curiosity can flow naturally. Sometimes, the best connections aren’t made through screens but in those authentic, face-to-face moments where ideas truly align.
