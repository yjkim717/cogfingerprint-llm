**The Great European Payment Hunt**

So, 2023 has been a wild ride for my little online shop! I was really relying on Mollie for payments, but got a frustrating rejection when trying to integrate Bancontact and Klarna – crucial for my European customers. It highlighted just how tricky it is to navigate payment processors across the continent. Now, I’m on the hunt for a solid solution that *does* handle those key European options – Klarna, Bancontact, and SEPA. Wish me luck!
