>## The Algorithm of Anxiety (and a Dream of Cornell)

It's funny, isn't it? How reliant we are on algorithms these days. From suggesting your next binge-watch to determining loan eligibility, code dictates so much. Lately, I’ve been staring at a different kind of algorithm – the one in my head, constantly calculating the cost of pursuing a Master's degree.

Specifically, the Cornell Tech CS ME program. It's a dream, a chance to level up my skills in a rapidly evolving field. But the reality of navigating the H1B visa process, coupled with the sheer cost of graduate school, is… daunting. It feels like a complex equation with too many variables. 

I've been exploring options, hoping for a stroke of luck, maybe even a full scholarship. It’s a long shot, I know. But the thought of pursuing this dream, pushing the boundaries of technology, keeps me searching, keeps me hoping that the algorithm will eventually work in my favor.
