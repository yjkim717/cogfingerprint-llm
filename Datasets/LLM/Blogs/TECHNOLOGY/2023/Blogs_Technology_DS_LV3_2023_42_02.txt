It’s 2023, and I’ve been on a mission to bake low-carb treats without sacrificing that perfect sweetness. For so long, I wrestled with clumpy sweeteners that left pockets of bitter or overly intense flavor—until I discovered Assugrin. This zero-carb powder mimics sugar’s fine texture so closely, it blends seamlessly into batters and sauces. Suddenly, my keto brownies taste evenly indulgent, bite after bite. It’s amazing how one small innovation can transform not just recipes, but the joy of sharing food with loved ones, guilt-free.
