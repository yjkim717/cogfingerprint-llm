It’s 2023, and you’d think Windows 10 would handle printer removal smoothly. But there I was, staring at a dropdown menu haunted by a deleted printer. I’d uninstalled it days ago, yet it lingered like a stubborn ghost. A bit of digging led me to Print Management—a tool I’d overlooked. With a few clicks, I cleared the phantom print jobs, and just like that, it vanished. It’s a small reminder: sometimes, the simplest tech solutions hide in plain sight, waiting to restore a little order to our digital lives.
