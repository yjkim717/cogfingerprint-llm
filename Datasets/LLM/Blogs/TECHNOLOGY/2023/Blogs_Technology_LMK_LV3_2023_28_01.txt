As a CS freshman in 2023, I was eager to dive into the tech world, but landing a startup internship seemed daunting. With a solid grasp of Python and Java, I was ready to apply my skills. I realized that a summer internship wasn't just about coding - it's about learning, networking, and growth. I learned to highlight my projects, network with professionals, and tailor my applications. It was a summer of discovery, and I'm excited to see where my tech journey takes me next.
