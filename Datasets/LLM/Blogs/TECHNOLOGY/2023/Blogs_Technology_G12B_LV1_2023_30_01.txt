## The Algorithm and the Apartment Hunt

It's wild how much the rental market feels like an algorithm these days. I'm searching for an apartment in NYC, and the whole process is… intense. You hear stories, of course, but experiencing it is something else. My broker just casually mentioned needing an "adjustment" to the fee to be competitive. Competitive with *who*? Apparently, a swarm of other hopefuls all vying for the same rent-stabilized apartment.

It feels like I'm not even looking for a home, but optimizing my profile to beat a machine.  Like, how much am I willing to pay to prove I'm the "best" applicant?  It’s unsettling. We celebrate technology connecting us, but sometimes it just amplifies existing inequalities and makes basic human needs feel like a bidding war.  I’m starting to wonder if a spreadsheet and a lot of patience are my best tools in this game.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
