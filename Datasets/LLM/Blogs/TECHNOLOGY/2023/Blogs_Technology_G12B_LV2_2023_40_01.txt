## Back to Basics: Why I'm Ditching the Home Lab (For Now)

For years, my home network was… a project. A passion, really. I dove headfirst into the world of custom routing configurations, VLANs, VPNs, the whole shebang. It was a fun little home lab, a sandbox for experimenting with network tech. I even wrestled with my Verizon Fios router for ages, trying to coax it into doing things it really wasn’t meant to do.

But life changes. I just moved into a new apartment, and suddenly, all that complexity felt… exhausting. I don’t need a network that can withstand a DDoS attack. I need a reliable connection for streaming, video calls, and, you know, just browsing the internet without troubleshooting for an hour.

So, I’m simplifying. I’m looking for a solid, dependable router – a "prosumer" router, I guess, that strikes a balance between features and ease of use. Something that just *works*, without demanding I become a network engineer every time my cat walks across the router.

It's a bit humbling, admitting I’m stepping back from the deep end. But honestly? It feels good. Sometimes, less is more, especially when it comes to technology. I’m embracing the simplicity, and hoping to find a router that can keep up with my need for reliable WiFi without requiring a PhD in networking. Any recommendations? Let me know in the comments!
