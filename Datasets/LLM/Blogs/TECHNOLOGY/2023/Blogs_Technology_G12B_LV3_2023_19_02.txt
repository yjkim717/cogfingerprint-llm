## The Unexpected Joy of Embracing the Glitch

Okay, so I stumbled across a discussion about *Critical Role* the other day – a tabletop RPG – and it got me thinking about something surprisingly relevant to our tech lives. Someone was praising a hilarious moment where a player, Sam Riegel, pulled a playful prank on another character, Scanlan, even when it pushed some boundaries.

It reminded me of how we often react to technology. We get frustrated when things glitch, when our favorite app throws an error, when the internet decides to have a bad day. But sometimes, isn't there a weird, unexpected joy in those moments? A chance to laugh at the absurdity, to troubleshoot with a friend, to appreciate the imperfect nature of the systems we rely on? 

Maybe embracing the occasional digital stumble is the key to a less stressful, more enjoyable tech experience. Just like Scanlan, we can learn to roll with it.
