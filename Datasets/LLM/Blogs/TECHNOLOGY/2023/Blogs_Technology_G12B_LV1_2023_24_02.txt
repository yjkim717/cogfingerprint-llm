## The Familiarity Fallacy: Why Upgrades Don't Always Feel Like Progress

Okay, so I’ve been playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for… well, let’s just say a *while*. Years. It's practically a second language at this point. My muscle memory knows exactly how to control recoil, where to position my crosshair, and how to counter-strafe like a pro (or at least, like someone who *thinks* they’re a pro). Then, CS2 dropped.

The hype was real. New engine, updated graphics, promised improvements. I dove in, ready to dominate. And immediately… I felt *off*.

It wasn’t a catastrophic failure. I wasn’t suddenly terrible. But everything felt… different. My sprays were wild, my flicks lacked their usual precision, and that satisfying *snap* of perfectly timed counter-strafing? Gone. Replaced with a frustrating wobble.

It’s weird, right? We crave upgrades. We want better graphics, smoother performance, “improved” gameplay. But sometimes, all that "improvement" does is disrupt the years of ingrained habits we've built.  It’s a classic case of the familiarity fallacy – we undervalue the comfort and predictability of what we already know.

CS2 *is* objectively better in many ways. The visuals are stunning, the tick rate is higher. But at this moment, I'm battling the feeling that I'm back at square one, relearning a game I thought I'd mastered. It's a humbling reminder that progress isn't always linear, and sometimes, the most advanced technology demands we unlearn what we thought we knew.  Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a lot of spraying to practice.
