The joys of remote work! As I settled into my new home in 2023, I was excited to ditch the daily commute and enjoy a better work-life balance. But, I soon discovered that my new area was stuck in the slow lane when it came to broadband speeds. As a remote worker, this was a major problem. I relied on a stable internet connection to stay productive and connected with my team.

Desperate for a solution, I started exploring alternatives. I looked into 5G WiFi and MiFi devices, which promised fast and reliable connectivity on-the-go. I also considered upgrading my home networking setup to optimize my internet speeds. After some research, I found a broadband deal that worked for me, and I was back up and running in no time. It was a relief to have a fast and stable connection, and I was able to get back to work without a hitch.
