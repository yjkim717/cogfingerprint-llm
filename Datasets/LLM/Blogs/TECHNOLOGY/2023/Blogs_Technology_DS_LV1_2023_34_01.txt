### The Glitch I Can't Patch: Living with My Hiatal Hernia

It started subtly. A persistent, nagging cough that felt like a tiny software bug in my throat. A raw, acidic feeling that no amount of water could wash away. After a battery of tests in early 2023, I finally got my diagnosis: a hiatal hernia and LPR (laryngopharyngeal reflux). My body, it seemed, had a fundamental design flaw.

My doctor’s prescription felt like a system update: a daily dose of omeprazole to quiet the acid production, a strict new "code" of dietary restrictions, and lifestyle patches like elevated sleeping. I followed the protocol meticulously, hoping for a clean reboot.

But the symptoms persisted. The omeprazole helped, but it wasn't a cure. My emergency fix became Gaviscon Advance, a liquid alginate that forms a protective raft in the stomach. It’s my control-alt-delete—a temporary reset when the inflammation flares up, a physical barrier against the internal glitch.

Living with this is a constant negotiation. I’ve become hyper-aware of my own architecture. I troubleshoot every meal, every stressful moment, every late night. It’s a chronic condition, not a problem to be solved but a system to be managed. Some days run smoothly; others are filled with frustrating error messages from my own body. The journey isn't about finding a magic bullet, but about learning to live gracefully with the glitch, one careful line of code at a time.
