It’s funny how the smallest details can pull you into a rabbit hole. Just last week, I was tweaking my bspwm setup and found myself staring at the man pages, puzzling over the cryptic syntax for node selection. Dots, hashes, brackets—it felt like deciphering an ancient language.

But then it hit me: this is what makes open-source tools so beautifully intricate. That arcane EBNF-style grammar isn’t just arbitrary; it’s a compact, precise way to define behavior. In 2023, where so much software hides behind glossy UIs, there’s something grounding about wrestling with text-based configuration. It reminds me that beneath every sleek interface lies a world of logic, patiently waiting for anyone curious enough to look.
