The Math Behind the Model: Unraveling Linear Regression

As I dove into building machine learning models in 2023, I found myself wrestling with the math behind linear regression. I understood how to implement it in code, but the underlying calculus remained a mystery. Specifically, I struggled to grasp how the chain rule and power rule were applied to calculate partial derivatives. It wasn't until I broke down the derivative calculations step by step that the fog began to clear. The chain rule, which helps us differentiate composite functions, and the power rule, which simplifies the differentiation of polynomial terms, were the keys to unlocking my understanding. As I gained clarity on these concepts, I appreciated the beauty of linear regression - a fundamental algorithm that relies on mathematical principles to make predictions. By understanding the math, I gained a deeper appreciation for the technology that drives our modern world.
