Remember when we thought technology would solve everything? In 2023, I watched AI generate entire novels while my phone buzzed with notifications I’d never open. We’ve built these incredible tools, yet I find myself nostalgic for my old iPod—that satisfying click wheel, that finite library. It knew its purpose. Sometimes I wonder if we’re creating a digital Atrocity Exhibition, a chaotic spectacle of our own making, dazzling but directionless. Are we engineering convenience, or just a new kind of noise? The real innovation might be learning to switch it all off.
