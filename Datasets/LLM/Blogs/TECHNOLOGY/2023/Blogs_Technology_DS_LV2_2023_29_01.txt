It’s funny—when I first started tinkering with language design, I thought the experts had all the answers. I’d eagerly jot down advice from seasoned developers and language creators, treating their words like gospel. But over time, I noticed something: much of that advice was rooted in narrow, personal experiences. One person’s elegant solution was another’s debugging nightmare, all because their context was tied to a specific language or compiler quirk.

Now, in 2023, with AI tools whispering suggestions and frameworks multiplying like rabbits, I’ve learned to trust my own experiments more. Sure, guidance is invaluable, but blindly following it can box you into someone else’s reality. The real magic happens when you blend wisdom with your own messy, hands-on learning. After all, every great language was once just someone’s wild idea, unburdened by too much "good" advice.
