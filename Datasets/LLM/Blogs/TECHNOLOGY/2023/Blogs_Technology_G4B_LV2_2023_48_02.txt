**The Type Question Mark**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Being a developer in 2023 and feeling like you’re perpetually searching. I’ve been scrolling through job boards, really digging into what’s out there, and I’m drawn to the solid reliability of Rails and Python on the backend. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with something smaller – dynamic types. 

Honestly, I’m starting to question if they’re *really* necessary. Do we always need that extra layer of strictness? It feels like sometimes it just adds complexity.  I’m looking for a role where I can build efficiently, and maybe, just maybe, a little less type-checking would be a good thing.  Anyone else feeling this?
