**Finding My Focus: Tech, Disability, and a Little Bit of Asking**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with something pretty personal – and it’s surprisingly tied to tech. As a software engineer, I thrive on focus, but my sensory processing can be… intense. Constant background noise used to completely derail my workflow. 

So, I’m currently navigating the slightly awkward process of requesting noise-canceling headphones from my employer. It’s a disability accommodation, and honestly, just *asking* felt huge. There’s this weird vulnerability in needing to explain how technology can actually help you do your job better. 

It’s also about the relocation costs – a small detail, but it highlighted how accessibility isn't just about the gear itself, it's about making it possible.  I’m hopeful it’ll make a real difference.  Anyone else been in a similar situation? Let’s chat! #accessibility #disability #tech #employeewellbeing
