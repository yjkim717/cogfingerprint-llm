As I dove into Elixir and Ecto in 2023, I struggled to keep my changesets organized. With complex validation functions and a growing API, it was clear I needed to modularize. I started breaking down my changesets into smaller, reusable functions. The result? Cleaner code and a more maintainable API. In this post, I'll share my journey and best practices for modularizing Ecto changesets, making it easier to manage complexity and scale your API with confidence.
