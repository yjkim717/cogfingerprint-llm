**The Startup Dream & My First Internship Hunt**

Okay, so 2023 feels like a *year* of figuring things out. As a fresh-faced CS student, I’m staring down the barrel of my first real internship search, and honestly, it’s a little daunting. I’m really hoping to land something at a startup – that scrappy, fast-paced vibe seems so appealing. 

I’ve been brushing up on my Python and Java, trying to feel a little more prepared. It’s funny – just last week, I was asking for advice on *finding* an internship, and now I’m feeling the pressure to actually *do* something with these skills! Wish me luck!
