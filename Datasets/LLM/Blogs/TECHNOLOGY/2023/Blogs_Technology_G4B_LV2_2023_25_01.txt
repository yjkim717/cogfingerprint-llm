**The Day My App Refused to Launch (and Why It Matters)**

Okay, let’s be honest – debugging can be brutal. I was wrestling with a Xamarin app last week, and suddenly, I was staring at the dreaded “ApplicationVerificationFailed” error in Visual Studio 2022. It felt…personal, actually. Like my app was actively refusing to cooperate. 

Turns out, it wasn’t a complex bug in the code. It was a simple, frustrating oversight: an expired code signing identity with Apple Developer. Seriously?!
