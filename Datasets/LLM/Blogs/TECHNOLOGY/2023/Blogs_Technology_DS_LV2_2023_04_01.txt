### My London Broadband Nightmare & The 5G Lifeline

Moving to London was supposed to be the start of my dream remote work chapter. The reality? A soul-crushing three-week wait for a broadband installation. My hotspot was a flickering candle in a digital storm, and my deadlines were looming like storm clouds.

In a moment of pure desperation, I started researching alternatives. That’s when I fell down the rabbit hole of 5G home broadband and MiFi deals. A 5G router with no engineer visit? It sounded too good to be true.

I took the plunge. The little box arrived the next day. I plugged it in, and within minutes, I had a wifi signal that didn’t just work—it soared. My video calls were crystal clear, and large files uploaded in a blink.

It was a stark reminder in 2023: sometimes the most robust solution isn't the traditional one. My entire work life was rebooted not by a fibre cable, but by a cellular signal I’d taken for granted. It’s funny how the future sometimes arrives in a small, unassuming box.
