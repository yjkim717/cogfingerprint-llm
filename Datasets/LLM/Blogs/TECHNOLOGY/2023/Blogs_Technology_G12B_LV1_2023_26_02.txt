>## The Tiny Powerhouse I Just Couldn't Let Go Of

It's funny what sticks with you, isn't it? I just saw someone selling a vintage combo – an i7-6700, an ASRock H110M-ITX motherboard, and DDR3 memory – for a steal. It brought back a flood of memories! Back in 2016, I built a mini-ITX rig with similar components. It was surprisingly powerful for its size. 

Now, everything’s moved on to Ryzen and DDR5, but there’s a certain charm to those older systems. A reminder of simpler times, and the ingenuity of squeezing performance into such a compact form. Makes you wonder what gems are still out there, waiting to be rediscovered!
