### The Quest for the Foolproof Backup: My Homelab Journey

You’d think that in 2023, with all our cloud storage and smart devices, creating a simple, reliable backup for my homelab would be a solved problem. I certainly did. My tool of choice was Restic—a brilliant piece of software that’s efficient and secure. The plan was elegant: a set of rotating USB drives to create an air-gapped, offline copy of my most precious data. It was my personal digital Fort Knox.

The reality, however, quickly turned into a comedy of errors. The core of the problem wasn't Restic, but the humble act of getting my computer to consistently recognize which USB drive was which. I’d plug in "Drive A," but the system would sometimes see it as "Drive B." My automated scripts would fail, and I’d find myself knee-deep in terminal commands, manually checking mount points at 11 PM on a Tuesday. I was spending more time *managing* the backup than I was actually protected by it. The very system I built for peace of mind was becoming a source of low-grade anxiety.

This whole ordeal led me to a simple but profound realization: the best system is the one you don't have to think about. A truly robust solution shouldn't rely on my remembering to run `lsblk` to troubleshoot a mount issue after a long day. I’m now on a new quest, not for the most powerful tool, but for the most boring one. I want a setup so simple and foolproof that it just… works. Because the goal was never to become a backup sysadmin; it was to protect my digital life and finally stop worrying about it.
