Itâ€™s funny how tech ages. In 2023, I saw an old i7-6700 and H110M-ITX combo for sale. It took me back to building my first compact PC, a puzzle of parts in a tiny case. That hardware was once a powerhouse; now it's a nostalgic relic. It reminds me that today's cutting-edge rig will one day be just another memory, a stepping stone in the relentless march of progress.
