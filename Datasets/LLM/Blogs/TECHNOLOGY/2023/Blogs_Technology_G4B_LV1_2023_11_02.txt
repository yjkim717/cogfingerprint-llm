**Pixels & Panic Attacks**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Being a freelancer in 2023 feels like a constant tightrope walk. I’m building my own business, trying to carve out a life outside the 9-to-5, but the instability… it’s brutal. I’ve been battling schizophrenia for years, and the unpredictable income just amplifies everything.

It’s hard enough just staying afloat, trying to manage my mental health and the constant worry about bills.  Sometimes I wonder if chasing this “freedom” is just another gilded cage.  Anyone else feeling this digital-fueled anxiety?
