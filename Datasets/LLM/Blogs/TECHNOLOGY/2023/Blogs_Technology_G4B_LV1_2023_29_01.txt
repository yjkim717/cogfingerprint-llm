**The Echo Chamber of Code**

It’s weird, right? As a developer, you’re constantly consuming advice – Stack Overflow answers, YouTube tutorials, even cryptic forum posts. But I’ve been realizing something crucial about *language design*: you have to be incredibly skeptical of it. 

I recently got bogged down trying to implement a new feature, stubbornly clinging to a solution I’d seen suggested by a senior designer. It was brilliant for *their* language, built on a completely different context. It just… didn’t fit. 

It really hit me that language designers – and even experienced developers – can fall into the trap of thinking their perspective is universal.  We're so deeply embedded in our own tools that we forget the broader landscape.  2023 is a wild ride of innovation, and blindly accepting borrowed wisdom is a fast track to a frustrating rebuild.  Trust your instincts, and question everything!
