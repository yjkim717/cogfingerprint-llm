**Lost in the Signals**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we’re constantly bombarded with *everything* now. Like Pynchon in *Gravity’s Rainbow*, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data, the tangled web of connections. Recently, I dove into William S. Burroughs’ *The Atrocity Exhibition* – a wild, fragmented read that mirrored this feeling. 

It reminded me of scrolling endlessly through my phone, absorbing snippets of information, images, and opinions.  We’re building these incredibly complex systems, yet it feels like we’re getting lost in the signals, struggling to find a clear signal of our own.  Anyone else feeling this way in 2023?
