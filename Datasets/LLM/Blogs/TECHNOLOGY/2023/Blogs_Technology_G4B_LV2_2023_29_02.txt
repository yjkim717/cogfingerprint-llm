**Lost in the C Maze? A Little Nostalgia, a Lot of Ideas**

There’s something deeply satisfying about wrestling with C, right? I spent a ridiculous amount of time in the late 90s and early 2000s building everything from simple games to early web apps in it. But lately, staring at those sprawling codebases, I’ve been thinking… could C be *better*? 

It sparked a little thought experiment – what if we’d baked in things like proper namespaces and a more intuitive type system back when it was designed? It’s a “what if” that’s surprisingly compelling.  Maybe it's time to revisit the core principles of language design. What do you think? #cprogramming #languages #softwaredevelopment
