As I navigated the 2023 NYC apartment rental market, a harsh reality hit me - the broker's fee can be a deal-breaker. I was vying for a coveted rent-stabilized apartment, but my broker urged me to agree to a higher fee to stay competitive. With multiple applicants vying for the same unit, I was forced to weigh the cost against the benefit. In a market driven by tech-savvy renters and automated applications, I wondered: are exorbitant broker's fees still justified? I hesitated, torn between securing my dream apartment and breaking the bank.
