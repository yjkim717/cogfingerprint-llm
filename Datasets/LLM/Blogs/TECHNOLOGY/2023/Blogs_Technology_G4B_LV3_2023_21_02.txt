**The Quest for the Perfect Gaming Soundscape**

Let’s be honest, as gamers in 2023, we’re *obsessed* with audio. It’s not just about hearing the explosions; it’s about feeling completely immersed. I’ve been on a bit of a hunt lately, desperately trying to find the sweet spot between sound quality and, crucially, comfort. 

I was really digging the Pioneer HDJ500/CUE1, but recently I hit a wall – a muddy low-end and an uncomfortable fit during those marathon gaming sessions. It’s frustrating, right?  It’s like investing in a fancy headset only to be distracted by discomfort. 

Right now, I’m searching for something neutral, with a solid 3.5mm jack (old habits die hard!), and ideally under $100.  It’s a surprisingly tricky balance to strike!  Anyone else experiencing this headphone purgatory?
