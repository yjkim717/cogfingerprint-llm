**The Worrying Glow of My Phone**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much of our lives now lives on a screen? I was staring at my phone last week, meticulously researching visa extensions for a potential trip – a little panic about Colombia and a looming expiration date. It felt so…clinical, pulling up regulations and worrying about entry denials. 

Honestly, it’s a strange feeling. Technology promises connection, but sometimes it just amplifies anxiety. I realized I was spending more time *preparing* for a trip than actually *dreaming* of it.  

It made me think about how we’re constantly chasing the ‘perfect’ travel plan, meticulously documented and planned, rather than just…going.  Maybe the point isn’t to eliminate all the worry – because there will always be some – but to find a balance between the security of information and the joy of the unknown.  Anyone else feel this digital tension?
