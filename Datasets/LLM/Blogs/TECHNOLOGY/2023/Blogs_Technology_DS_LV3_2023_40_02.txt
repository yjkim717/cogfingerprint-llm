There I was, coffee in hand, staring at the bspwm man page like it was some ancient runic text. It was 2023, and I was determined to master my tiling window manager, to bend it perfectly to my will. But the syntax—those cryptic brackets, pipes, and mysterious dots—felt like a secret code I wasn’t meant to crack.

Were those symbols literal characters or part of some deeper EBNF grammar? I dove in, treating it like a linguistic puzzle. Each optional element [like this] and logical operator | became a small victory, a step toward fluency. That elusive ‘#’ wasn’t just a symbol; it was a key to repetition, to understanding structure.

Slowly, the manual transformed from a wall of impenetrable text into a clear blueprint. It reminded me that technology, at its heart, is a language—and with patience, we can all learn to speak it.
