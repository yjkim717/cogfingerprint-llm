It’s 2023, and I’m still amazed by how far home audio has come. I remember the days when setting up a surround sound system meant wrestling with a tangle of wires and a bulky AV receiver. Now, with active subwoofers packing built-in amplifiers, optical inputs, and speaker outputs, it’s like having a mini powerhouse right in my living room. I can drive my speakers directly—no receiver needed. It’s simpler, cleaner, and honestly, it feels like technology finally listened to what we actually wanted.
