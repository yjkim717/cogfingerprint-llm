**The Algorithm Said “Yes,” But My Gut Said “Wait…”**

Remember when we thought tech would make everything simpler? I’m starting to feel a little…complicated. I was searching for a new apartment – a rent-stabilized gem in NYC – and a listing popped up, perfect on paper.  Then, the broker hit me with an unexpected application fee increase. It felt like a glitch in the system. 

It’s a weird feeling, isn’t it?  The algorithm showed me opportunity, but the human element – the potential for unfair practices like these – brought it crashing down.  It made me realize that even in a digital world, trusting your instincts and understanding the local rules is still *everything*.  Anyone else feeling this digital dissonance?
