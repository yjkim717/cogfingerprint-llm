### The Ghost in My Pocket

My phone buzzed with another news alert. Another breakthrough, another AI model that could write a sonnet or diagnose a disease. It was 2023, and the future was shouting at us from our pockets.

I remember a time when technology felt like a tool. Now, it feels more like a presence—a ghost in the machine, whispering promises of a perfected life while quietly feeding a new kind of anxiety. I found myself endlessly scrolling through articles about the "singularity" and the ethics of sentient code, my own mortality suddenly feeling tied to the processing power of a silicon chip.

It’s a strange, modern fear. Not of a physical illness, but of becoming obsolete. Of a world that evolves so rapidly that your own mind can’t keep pace. I had to consciously unplug, to walk in the woods and feel the un-programmable chaos of nature. The relief was palpable. The future will arrive on its own schedule. My only job is to remember that I am still human, beautifully, messily human, and no algorithm can ever truly replicate the weight of that truth.
