"Fine-Tuning the Future: My SDXL Training Adventure

As I dove into the world of AI-generated art in 2023, I found myself wrestling with the intricacies of training SDXL models within Kohya for Loras. My goal was to create stunning visuals, but the inconsistent results were driving me crazy! I was tweaking training settings and adjusting network alpha values, but the outcomes were unpredictable. I turned to the community for guidance, seeking advice on optimal settings for my Loras. The responses varied, and I realized that fine-tuning these models is as much an art as it is a science. Through trial and error, I've gained valuable insights into the nuances of SDXL training. While there's still much to explore, I'm excited to share my findings and continue the conversation with fellow tech enthusiasts."
