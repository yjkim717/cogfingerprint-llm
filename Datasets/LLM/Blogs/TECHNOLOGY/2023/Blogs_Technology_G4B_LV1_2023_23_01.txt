**The Ghosts in the Machine: Why I’m Questioning Everything About Opencart**

Okay, let’s be honest – staring at lines of code can do strange things to a person. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a particularly stubborn beast: an old Opencart site. It’s…fine. It *works*. But “fine” isn’t enough, is it? 

I inherited a legacy website, and while it’s served its purpose, the architecture feels like a tangled ball of yarn. The database is a mess, the checkout validation is clunky, and honestly, the whole thing just feels…fragile.  It’s a constant low-level anxiety. 

I’ve been seriously considering a pivot.  I’m not saying Opencart is *bad*, but it’s starting to feel like a band-aid on a broken bone.  I'm looking at alternatives – Prestashop, Pimcore, even exploring a more modern, headless approach.  

There’s a weird feeling of letting go involved, you know? It’s like admitting a tool isn’t fit for the job anymore.  But clinging to outdated technology just to avoid the hassle of change feels…well, unproductive.  It's a reminder that in tech, just like in life, sometimes the bravest thing you can do is admit it's time to move on.  What are your experiences with legacy systems?
