"Lost in the Cloud: My Struggle with Digital Detox in 2023"

As I sat in a Colombian café in 2023, sipping on a rich coffee, I couldn't help but feel a pang of anxiety. My laptop and phone were dead, and I was completely disconnected from the digital world. At first, it was liberating, but as the hours ticked by, I began to feel a growing sense of FOMO. Was the world still spinning without me? Had I missed anything crucial? The experience was a harsh reminder of our dependence on technology. As I navigated the complexities of my Colombian visa and pondered a 90-day extension, I realized that sometimes, it's the digital detox that we need to reconnect with the world around us. Embracing the uncertainty, I took a deep breath and let the beauty of the moment sink in. The world, it turned out, was still spinning – with or without my digital presence.
