It’s 2023, and I’m deep in a late-night session with Ableton Live, chasing something intangible. I load up Vital Synth, tweaking MIDI notes away from standard tuning, trying to hit 528 Hz—the so-called "miracle" Solfeggio frequency. It’s funny: in this age of AI and instant access, I find myself drawn to ancient tones, bending digital tools to explore resonance and wellness. Sometimes, progress isn’t just about sharper tech, but how we repurpose it to reconnect with ourselves, one perfectly detuned note at a time.
