I'm swapping stethoscopes for screens, reflecting on how technology has both hindered and helped my journey with chronic illness. In 2023, it's surreal to think about how far we've come - and how far we still have to go. I recall countless doctor's appointments, feeling dismissed and frustrated as I struggled to put into words the debilitating brain fog and severe malaise that had taken over my life. But online communities and health forums became my lifeline, connecting me with others who understood my medical mystery. As I navigated the digital world, I realized that technology wasn't just a tool, but a bridge to empathy and understanding. Through social media and blogs, I found solace in shared experiences and learned to advocate for my own mental health. Now, I'm rethinking the intersection of tech and healthcare - and the hope it brings for a more compassionate, connected future.
