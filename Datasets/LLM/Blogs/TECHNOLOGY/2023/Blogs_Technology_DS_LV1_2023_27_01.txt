### My Digital Battlefield: A Tech Support Story

It’s funny how a hobby can reframe your entire professional life. Lately, my Dungeons & Dragons group has been through the wringer; we’ve lost two beloved characters to failed saving throws and bad positioning. It’s made me paranoid. My new mission? Build a wizard dedicated entirely to battlefield control—someone who protects the party, manipulates the enemy, and prevents disaster before it happens.

And you know what? It hit me that this is exactly what I do in my day job in IT. I’m not slinging fireballs; I’m the support caster for our company’s entire digital ecosystem.

My "concentration saving throws" are the constant, low-grade stress tests of keeping our core systems online against phishing attempts, unexpected updates, and user error. A single critical failure here doesn’t just mean a character sheet gets retired; it can mean lost revenue and massive headaches. My "control spells" are the automated security protocols, the backup routines, and the clear documentation I put in place to shape the "battlefield"—our network—to our advantage.

In 2023, with AI and remote work expanding the attack surface daily, being a paranoid support specialist isn’t a negative. It’s a necessity. My goal isn’t to be the flashy hero, but the one who ensures the party—my team—never has to make that dreaded death-saving throw in the first place. It’s a different kind of power, and honestly, it’s just as rewarding.
