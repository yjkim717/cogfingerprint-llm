**The Algorithm Knows Me… But Does *I* Know the Algorithm?**

Okay, let’s be real – 2023 feels like a year of being subtly, relentlessly watched. Not in a creepy, Big Brother kind of way (though, let’s be honest, that’s a valid worry too!). It’s more like the internet – specifically, the algorithms powering everything from TikTok to Netflix – are just *really* good at figuring us out. 

I was thinking about this while watching the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon – that weird, simultaneous obsession with these two wildly different films. It struck me that a lot of the initial criticism felt… reactive. Like people were so quick to dismiss something because it didn’t fit into a pre-determined box, a narrative they’d already built. 

And that’s exactly what I’m seeing with algorithms all the time. We scroll, we click, we like, and suddenly, our feeds are flooded with content that *mirrors* our existing tastes. It’s comfortable, predictable, and… a little bit lonely, isn’t it? 

I’ve started actively trying to push myself outside my digital bubble.  Following accounts I genuinely find interesting, even if they’re totally different from what I usually engage with. It’s a small act of rebellion, a way of reminding myself that I’m not just a data point being optimized for engagement. 

It’s a reminder that while technology can connect us, it’s up to *us* to decide what we connect *to*.  What about you? Are you feeling the algorithmic pull, or are you actively shaping your digital world?
