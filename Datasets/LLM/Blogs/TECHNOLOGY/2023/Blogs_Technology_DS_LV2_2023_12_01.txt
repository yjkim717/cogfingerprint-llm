Staring at my tangled Ecto changeset, I sighed. It was a mess of validation functions and pre-processing logic, a classic case of "it worked at the time." In 2023, the real challenge isn't just making code workâ€”it's making it last. I finally took a breath and started to modularize, untangling the complexity. Sometimes, the most advanced tech solution is simply writing code your future self will thank you for.
