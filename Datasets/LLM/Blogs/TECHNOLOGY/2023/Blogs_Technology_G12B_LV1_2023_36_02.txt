## The Algorithm Knows, But Does It *See*?

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re living in this age of hyper-connectivity, where algorithms supposedly optimize everything. Job applications, dating profiles, even the news we consume – all curated by lines of code. And yet, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what gets *lost* in that optimization.

I was reading a story the other day about someone in the French civil service. A year sidelined, essentially paid to do nothing, after reporting harassment. A year of ignored applications, a creeping sense of isolation. It hit me hard because it felt... digital. Like being buried under a pile of automated rejections.

Think about LinkedIn. You tailor your profile, meticulously crafting keywords, highlighting achievements. You apply for dozens of roles, get automated “thanks for applying, but…” emails, and slowly, the optimism drains away. It becomes a process devoid of human connection. The algorithm sees your skills, ranks you against others, and decides. But does it *see* the context? The nuances of your experience? The quiet resilience it takes to keep trying after repeated rejection?

I wonder if that French civil servant’s experience could be mirrored in our digital lives. Are we building systems that, in their pursuit of efficiency, inadvertently create a modern form of marginalization? A digital blacklist, not of names, but of profiles deemed “unsuitable.”

It’s a chilling thought. We need to be mindful of the human cost of these technological advancements. Because ultimately, technology should serve us, not silently diminish us. Shouldn't it?
