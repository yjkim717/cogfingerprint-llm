**The Unexpected Hiccup in the Cloud**

There’s something incredibly frustrating about a perfectly executed tech upgrade… only to discover a tiny, nagging problem lurking beneath the surface.  Recently, I was running through a vCenter and host upgrade for a client, feeling pretty pleased with the process. Then, bam – a weird licensing alert popped up. One server was stubbornly claiming it was running on an evaluation license, despite the full, paid upgrade! 

It really highlights how complex things can get, even with established platforms like VMware.  It's a reminder that even with meticulous planning, a single misconfiguration can throw a wrench in the works.  It made me think about how crucial it is to thoroughly evaluate *everything* when moving systems – and that sometimes, the biggest challenges aren’t the upgrades themselves, but the unexpected details afterward.
