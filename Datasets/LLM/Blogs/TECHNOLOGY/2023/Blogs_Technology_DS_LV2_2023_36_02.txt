Of course, here is a reflective blog post on technology, written from a personal perspective.

### The Ghost in the Machine: A Year of Being Digitally Invisible

It’s a strange feeling, being paid to do nothing. For a year, my work email was a ghost town. No meeting invites, no project briefs, not even a “hello” on the team chat. My official title was “Senior Developer,” but my real job was to occupy a chair and watch my skills atrophy. The system had effectively put me on mute.

It all started after I raised a flag about our new project management AI. I wasn’t against progress; I was against a broken algorithm making biased decisions that were tanking team morale. I presented the data, suggested fixes, and was met with a polite smile and a “We’ll look into it.”

They did look into it—by looking right through me. My access to new code repositories was revoked. My name was quietly removed from distribution lists. In 2023, you don’t need a physical corner office to isolate someone; you just need admin privileges. I was a digital ghost, my presence acknowledged only by the automated payroll system.

This experience made me realize the dark side of our hyper-efficient workplaces. Technology, meant to connect and empower, can be weaponized to create the most sterile, soul-crushing form of professional exile. It’s not a loud, dramatic firing. It’s a silent, algorithmic sidelining, designed to make you question your own value until you simply fade away.

I finally left, of course. But the lesson stuck with me: as we build smarter systems, we must fiercely protect the human element. Because no algorithm should ever have the power to make a person feel invisible.
