>## The Tightrope Walk of Final Touches

Okay, deep breath. It’s that time of year again – the frantic scramble to finalize papers after reviewer feedback. I was just wrestling with the “camera-ready” stage for an ICML submission, and it’s surprisingly stressful! How much *can* you actually change? Do you rewrite entire sections based on meta-reviews, or just polish what’s already there?

It feels like walking a tightrope. You want to address concerns thoughtfully, show you listened, but also stay true to the heart of your work. I ended up focusing on clarifying arguments and strengthening the experimental setup – subtle shifts, really. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most impactful improvements aren’t massive overhauls, but strategically targeted refinements. Anyone else feel this tension?
