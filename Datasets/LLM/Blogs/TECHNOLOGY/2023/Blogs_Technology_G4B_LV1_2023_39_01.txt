**The Ghost of Smooth Gestures**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with a frustrating little tech hiccup lately. Remember Smooth Gestures Plus? That amazing Chrome extension that let you control tabs and your mouse with smooth, intuitive gestures? It’s just…gone. Vanished from the Chrome Web Store. 

It’s weird, isn’t it? How reliant we’ve become on these little tweaks to make browsing *feel* right. It makes you think about how much of our digital experience is built on these disappearing extensions, and how quickly things we love can simply vanish.  Anyone else feeling this loss?
