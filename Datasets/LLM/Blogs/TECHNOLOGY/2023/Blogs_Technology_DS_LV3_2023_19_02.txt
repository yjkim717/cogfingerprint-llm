It’s 2023, and AI is everywhere—but the real magic happens when we use it to enhance creativity, not replace it. I was reminded of this watching Sam Riegel’s Scanlan prank in Critical Role: he leaned into the awkwardness, avoiding meta-gaming for authentic humor. It’s a lesson for tech, too. We can get so caught up in optimization that we forget the human element. Let’s use tools to tell better stories, connect more deeply, and keep the delightful unpredictability alive. After all, the best moments aren’t scripted.
