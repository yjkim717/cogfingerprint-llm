## The Static in My Head and the Endless Scroll

It’s weird, isn't it? How the tools meant to connect us can sometimes feel… isolating? I've been feeling it a lot lately. Not in a dramatic, "technology is evil" kind of way, but more like a low-humming static in my brain. 

It started subtly. Just a feeling of being…off. Like I was wading through cotton. I’d sit down to work, and suddenly, an hour had vanished into the endless scroll of Instagram. I'd promise myself "just five minutes," and emerge feeling strangely drained, yet somehow still not quite focused. 

It mirrors what I've been reading about, this feeling of persistent brain fog, even when tests come back "normal." I think, for me, a huge part of it is this constant digital input. The curated perfection, the relentless news cycle, the pressure to *always* be online. It’s exhausting.

I’m trying to be more intentional. Setting timers for social media, leaving my phone in another room when I need to concentrate, even just taking a walk without headphones. It’s a small shift, but I’m hoping it’ll help quiet the static and let me actually *hear* myself think again.  It's a weird thing, realizing the thing that’s supposed to simplify your life can also contribute to a feeling of… malaise. Anyone else feeling this in 2023?
