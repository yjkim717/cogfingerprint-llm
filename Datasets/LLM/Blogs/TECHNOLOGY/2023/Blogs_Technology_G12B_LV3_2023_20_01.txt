## The Blue Light and the Blur: When Tech Feels… Off

It's 2023, and we're *all* tethered to screens. I get it. I’m writing this on one! But lately, I've been feeling… fuzzy. Not physically, necessarily, but mentally. Like wading through cotton wool, struggling to focus, constantly forgetting where I put my keys (again!). It's a feeling I’ve been reading about a lot lately – they call it "brain fog," and it seems to be a surprisingly common companion for those of us navigating chronic illness and the general anxieties of modern life.

For months, I've felt this persistent malaise, this low-level hum of… *offness*. Doctor after doctor, test after test. Everything comes back normal. It’s frustrating, to say the least. But what's been even harder is the weight of feeling like I’m making it all up. 

I’ve started to wonder if some of it is tied to my tech habits. We’re constantly bombarded with information, notifications, and the pressure to *always be on*.  Scrolling through endless feeds, comparing myself to curated online personas… it’s exhausting. Could the constant stimulation be contributing to this mental blur? 

I’m not saying ditch your phone entirely (impossible, right?), but I’m starting to experiment with boundaries. More screen-free evenings. Designated “focus zones” where devices are banished.  It’s a small shift, but already, I’m noticing a glimmer of clarity.  Maybe, just maybe, reclaiming a little space from the digital world can help me reclaim some space in my own mind.  Anyone else feeling this? Let’s talk.
