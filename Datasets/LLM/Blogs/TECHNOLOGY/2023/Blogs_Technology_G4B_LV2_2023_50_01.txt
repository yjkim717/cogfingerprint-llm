**Chasing the Right Note**

There’s something wonderfully strange about obsessing over frequencies, isn’t there? Lately, I’ve been diving down the rabbit hole of Solfeggio tones – those ancient frequencies supposedly linked to healing and vibration. It started with a simple question: how do I get Ableton Live Lite to actually *play* a 528Hz note? 

Experimenting with pitch modification felt like a puzzle, tweaking Vital synth parameters. It’s a reminder that even with all this digital control, we’re still chasing a feeling, a resonance.  Maybe it’s just me, but it's strangely meditative.

Do you want me to tweak this or create a different version?
