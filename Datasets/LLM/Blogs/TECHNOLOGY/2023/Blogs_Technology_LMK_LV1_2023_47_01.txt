"Troubleshooting NAT Networks: A Tale of Two Hypervisors"

As I dove into setting up a new virtual machine in 2023, I found myself wrestling with a familiar foe: NAT network configuration. I was using both VMWare and Virtual Box, and to my surprise, the experience was not as seamless as I'd hoped. After creating a NAT network in both hypervisors, I encountered connectivity issues between my host machine and the virtual guest. The error messages were cryptic, and the documentation, while extensive, didn't quite cover my specific use case. After some trial and error (and a few reboots!), I discovered that the issue lay in the way each hypervisor handles NAT network configuration. VMWare required a specific adapter setting, while Virtual Box needed a tweak to its network CIDR. It was a frustrating but enlightening experience, and one that left me appreciating the nuances of virtual networking.
