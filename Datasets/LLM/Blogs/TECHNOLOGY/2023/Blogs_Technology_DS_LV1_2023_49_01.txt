### Navigating the 90-Day Tourist Visa in Colombia: A Cautionary Tale

Thinking about a quick border hop to reset your 90-day Colombian tourist visa? Proceed with extreme caution. While the idea of popping over to Ecuador or Peru for a weekend to "renew" your stay seems straightforward, immigration officers are increasingly wise to this tactic.

The critical factor is your travel pattern. If your passport shows repeated, brief exits and re-entries, you may be flagged. Officers have the discretion to deny entry, questioning whether you are a genuine tourist. They might scrutinize your finances, demand proof of a round-trip or onward ticket, and ultimately turn you away if your intentions seem more about long-term residence than tourism.

The safest route for a longer stay is to apply for a formal visa extension through Migración Colombia before your initial 90 days expire. While it involves paperwork and a fee, it’s far less risky than a denied entry stamp that could disrupt your travels entirely.

### My Digital Detox and the App I Couldn't Quit

In 2023, I finally did it—a full weekend digital detox. I deleted social media apps, turned off notifications, and told my friends I’d be off-grid. The silence was… loud. But it was also revealing.

I expected to miss the endless scroll, but what I truly craved was my maps app. Not for navigation, but for its timeline feature. I realized I’d been using it as a digital diary, retracing my steps to remember a cute coffee shop or the name of a park. My phone had become less a social portal and more an external hard drive for my life.

The experience was a quiet revelation. We often fear disconnecting will make us miss the noise, but sometimes it just shows us which tools have become seamless, helpful extensions of ourselves. I came back online, but I kept my maps epiphany close.
