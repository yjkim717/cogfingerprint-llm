There’s a strange loneliness in trying to connect in 2023. I was in the right spot in *Dark Souls*, used a Furlcalling Finger Remedy, and… nothing. No golden summon signs, no jolly cooperation—just me and the silence. It’s a perfect metaphor for our hyper-connected world: all the right settings, yet the link fails. Sometimes, the most advanced tech just reminds you that you’re on your own, staring at an empty screen, waiting for a ghost that never appears.
