## Does Our Digital "Hiatus Hernia" Ever Shrink?

It's funny, sometimes life throws unexpected parallels at you. I was reading a post on Reddit the other day about a woman whose sliding hiatus hernia actually *shrank* over years. Apparently, hernias aren't always a one-way ticket. It got me thinking about our relationship with technology.

We’ve all got it, right? This digital overflow – the constant notifications, the endless scroll, the feeling that *something* is always demanding our attention. It feels like a bit of our mental space has been… pushed out of place. Like a digital hiatus hernia, if you will.

For years, I’ve been battling it. More news, more social media, more *stuff* vying for my brainpower. Lately, though, I’ve been actively trying to pull back. Setting stricter boundaries with my phone, dedicating real time to unplugged hobbies. It’s been surprisingly… calming. 

It feels a little like that Reddit user’s story. Maybe, just maybe, we *can* reclaim some of that mental space. Maybe we *can* shrink our digital "hernias" and feel a little more grounded again. It’s definitely a work in progress, but it’s a hopeful thought in a world that’s constantly pushing for more.
