Of all the projects I’ve started, this one feels the most like a quiet rebellion. It began not on a whiteboard in a brightly lit office, but in the hushed, liminal space of my own mind. You see, my sister lives with schizophrenia. For years, I’ve watched her navigate a world that often speaks in a language too rigid, too literal, for the sprawling, symbolic landscapes she sometimes inhabits. How do you explain the feeling of a thought that has texture, or a sound that has color, to someone who has never experienced it? You often can’t. So, I stopped trying to explain, and started trying to create.

This is how “Tara Kinesis” was born. It’s a children’s-style book, filled with whimsical illustrations and simple language, but its heart beats with profoundly adult themes. Tara is a character who doesn’t just see the world differently; she *interacts* with it differently. She can gentle a storm cloud with a melody or untangle a knotted forest path by re-arranging its shadows. It’s a metaphor, of course—a way to give form to the internal experiences that are so difficult to articulate. The goal was never to diagnose or pathologize, but to build a bridge of understanding through story.

And in 2023, the most logical way to build the widest possible bridge was digitally. So, the core of the project is a free digital download for everyone. No paywalls, no sign-ups. If it can offer a moment of clarity or comfort to even one person feeling isolated by their own mind, or to a loved one struggling to understand, then its purpose is fulfilled. The story needs to travel, to be shared in Discord channels and on social media, to live on devices as personal as the thoughts it describes.

But I also wanted to create something tactile, a totem for those who truly connected with Tara’s journey. This is where the technology of web3 offered a beautiful, unexpected solution. For the small community of initial supporters—those who hold the project’s avatar—there’s an exclusive physical artifact waiting. Once the digital edition finds its audience and the initial run is complete, each of these holders will receive a numbered, physical certificate. It’s a tangible piece of the project’s soul, a “thank you” etched not just in data, but in paper and ink.

In a way, the entire project is a conversation between the digital and the physical. The story itself uses the simple, accessible format of a children’s book to discuss the complex, often stigmatized reality of a condition like schizophrenia. And its distribution uses the boundless reach of the internet to give the story away, while leveraging modern technology to reward early belief with a object you can hold in your hands. It’s my small attempt to prove that even our most challenging human experiences can find a home, and even a little magic, in the tools of our time. Tara would approve, I think. She was always good at finding new ways to connect things.
