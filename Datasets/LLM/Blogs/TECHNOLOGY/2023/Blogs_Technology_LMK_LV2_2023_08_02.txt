"Stepping into the Virtual 'Safe Space'".

As I logged into the corporate disability event online in 2023, a wave of unease washed over me. The topic was close to my heart - supporting individuals with Asperger's. Yet, the notification that the session was being recorded made me hesitant. Wasn't this supposed to be a 'safe space'? I couldn't help but wonder, what did 'safe' really mean in the virtual world? My story is a reminder that as we adopt technology to connect, we must also be mindful of the invisible boundaries we may be crossing.
