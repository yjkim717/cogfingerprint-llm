I still can't believe the frustration I've been dealing with my 2022 Jayco SLX RV. It's been a year since I took delivery, and I've lost count of how many times I've had to deal with a leaky slide. At first, I thought it was just a minor issue that the dealership could fix, but the problem persists. The latest RV repair attempt was just last month, and I'm at my wit's end. The trailer issue is not just an inconvenience; it's a safety concern. As I research my options, I'm considering seeking help from a lemon law lawyer. It's disheartening to think that my dream RV has turned into a recurring nightmare. I'm not alone, as many others have shared similar experiences online. It's 2023, and you'd think that RV manufacturers would have ironed out these kinds of issues by now. Guess I'll be exploring my lemon law options.
