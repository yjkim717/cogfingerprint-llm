**The Worrying Buzz of the Algorithm**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we get caught up in the digital hum? Lately, I’ve been feeling a little… anxious about it. Specifically, about how much my online activity seems to be shaping my world. 

I was just reading about a guy in Colombia – desperately trying to get a visa extension, worried a quick trip to Peru or the US would derail everything. It made me think about how our digital footprint leaves a trail, and sometimes that trail feels a little unsettling. 

We build these profiles, these little algorithms decide what we see, and it’s easy to feel like you’re being subtly guided.  It’s a strange feeling, knowing that a simple Google search could impact something important.  Maybe we need to be a little more mindful about the information we share, and the spaces we occupy online.  Anyone else feeling this digital buzz?
