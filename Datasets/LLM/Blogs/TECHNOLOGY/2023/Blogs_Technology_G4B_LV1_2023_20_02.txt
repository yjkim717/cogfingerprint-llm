**The Algorithm and My Fear**

It’s weird, isn’t it? We’re so connected, constantly bombarded with information, and yet sometimes I feel *more* isolated. Lately, I've been staring at my phone, scrolling through articles about the latest health scares – surgeries, chronic illnesses, the whole shebang – and a familiar anxiety has crept in. 

It’s funny, because I spend so much time *online*, researching everything, trying to feel in control. But the sheer volume of bad news, the constant reminders of fragility, it’s overwhelming. I even started tracking my sleep with an app, obsessively monitoring my heart rate. 

There’s a strange disconnect. We’re building these incredible tools to understand and manage our health, but sometimes they just amplify the fear. It’s like the algorithm is reflecting my own anxieties right back at me.  Maybe the answer isn't more data, but a little less screen time and a lot more… breathing.
