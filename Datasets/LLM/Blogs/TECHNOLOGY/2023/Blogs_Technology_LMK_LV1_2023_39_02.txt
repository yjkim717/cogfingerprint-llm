"Upgrading my home theater setup in 2023, I'm on the hunt for the perfect active subwoofer with a built-in amplifier and AV receiver. My trusty Logitech Z906 has served me well, but I'm ready for a streamlined solution. I'm looking for a subwoofer that can power my surround sound system without needing a separate AV receiver. Is this the holy grail of home audio?"
