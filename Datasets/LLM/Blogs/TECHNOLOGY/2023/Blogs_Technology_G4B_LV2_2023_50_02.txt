**The Weight of a Username**

Anyone else feel like online dating is… exhausting? I’ve been scrolling, swiping, and sending messages for months now, and it’s starting to feel less like finding a connection and more like a performance.  Recently, I stumbled across a Reddit thread where someone was practically begging for a dating site that let you reveal your *whole* self upfront. They were tired of the ghosting – the sudden, unsettling silence after a promising exchange.

It got me thinking about usernames.  We craft these carefully curated identities, hoping to attract the ‘right’ person. But aren’t we really just building a facade?  Wouldn’t it be amazing if, from the get-go, we could just *be* ourselves, letting a potential match see the real you?  Maybe that’s the key to cutting through the digital noise and finding something genuine.  What do you think?
