"Type Safety Surprises in Kotlin (2023 Edition)". I recently stumbled upon a quirk in Kotlin's type checking that left me puzzled. When using an infix function with a generic parameter and KProperty1, the compiler didn't enforce type checking as I expected. For instance, `myInfixFun(String::length)` compiled without issues, even though `length` isn't a `String`. After digging deeper, I discovered that this behavior is due to the way Kotlin handles type inference and generic parameters. This experience taught me to be more mindful of these subtleties when leveraging Kotlin's advanced features.
