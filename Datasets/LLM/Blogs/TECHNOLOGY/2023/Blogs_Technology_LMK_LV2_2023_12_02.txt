As I dive into Elixir in 2023, I'm struck by its elegance. The pipe operator is a game-changer, allowing me to chain functions together with ease. But what about non-commutative functions? Can I still use the pipe notation? I've been experimenting with piping values into multi-parametric functions, and while it works, I'm left wondering: is it idiomatic? Am I bending the language to my will, or is this a legitimate use case? As I explore Elixir's functional programming paradigm, I'm reminded that sometimes the most interesting questions arise from pushing the boundaries of what's considered "normal".
