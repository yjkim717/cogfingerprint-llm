Of course, here is a reflective blog post about technology from 2023.

### The Ghost in My Pocket

My phone buzzed on the nightstand. Again. It was 2:17 AM, and the blue light cut through the darkness like a siren. I wasn’t getting a text; it was just another notification from an app I barely used, a ghost of a demand for my attention.

That was the moment in 2023 when I finally saw it clearly. This little rectangle of glass and metal wasn’t just a tool. It was a tenant living rent-free in my life, dictating my rhythms with its pings and pulses. I’d scroll through endless reels of other people’s curated happiness, feeling simultaneously connected to the world and utterly alone in my own room.

The promise was connection, but the reality was a strange, silent performance. We were all broadcasting, but was anyone truly receiving?

So, I started a rebellion. A small one. I turned off all non-essential notifications. The silence was jarring at first, but then… it was peaceful. I started leaving my phone in another room during dinner. I rediscovered the weight of a physical book in my hands.

The technology itself isn’t the villain. It’s incredible. But I’m learning to be its master, not its servant. The real connection I was searching for wasn’t in a feed; it was in the quiet, uninterrupted moments I was finally giving back to myself.
