As I navigated the job market in 2023, I couldn't help but notice the ubiquity of TypeScript in both frontend and backend tech stacks. As a frontend developer, I had grown accustomed to its benefits, but I was surprised to see its adoption in server-side development. This got me thinking - what's driving its widespread adoption? Is it the promise of type safety, or the ease of integration with existing JavaScript ecosystems? As I pondered my own job search preferences, I realized that TypeScript's versatility was a major draw for me, and likely for many others in the industry.
