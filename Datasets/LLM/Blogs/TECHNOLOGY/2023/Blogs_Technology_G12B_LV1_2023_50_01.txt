## The Curious Case of the 528Hz and My Synthesizer

Okay, so I’ve been down a rabbit hole lately. A really specific rabbit hole. It started with this fascination with Solfeggio frequencies – those ancient tones supposedly linked to healing and well-being. Specifically, the 528Hz one kept popping up. There’s something undeniably calming about it, right?

But here’s the techy snag: I wanted to incorporate it into my music production. I’m using Ableton Live Lite and a synth called Vital, and I was frustrated. Standard MIDI notes are locked into semitones. 528Hz? Doesn’t quite line up. 

It’s a small problem, really. But it got me thinking about how technology, for all its power, can sometimes impose these artificial limitations. We build systems based on neat divisions, forgetting that the universe doesn't always play by those rules.  I eventually figured out a workaround using pitch modification in Vital, but the whole experience underscored a lovely, slightly frustrating truth about creativity and tech – you often have to bend the rules to get what you want.
