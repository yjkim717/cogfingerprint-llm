Last summer, we decided to unplug entirely. No screens, just the timeless rhythm of paddling our rented canoe from Whitehorse toward Dawson. Our outfitter in Whitehorse joked we were trading Wi-Fi for wilderness. For ten days on the Yukon, our only notifications were loon calls and river currents. It was the most advanced technology we experienced all yearâ€”a genuine, uninterrupted connection.
