Of course, here is a reflective blog post about technology from 2023.

### The Unplanned Digital Detox

It happened in a cramped Medellin hostel. My phone slipped, the screen flashing one last protest before going permanently, tragically black.

For 48 hours, I was untethered. No frantic Google searches for "Colombia visa extension," no doom-scrolling through forums about entry denials. Just the chaotic, beautiful noise of a city I was suddenly forced to experience firsthand.

And a funny thing happened. The anxiety about my 90-day tourist visa clock, which Iâ€™d been constantly monitoring, began to fade. I asked for directions in broken Spanish, found a cafe by following the smell of fresh coffee, and simply watched life happen around me.

That broken screen was a gift. In our hyper-connected 2023 world, we outsource our curiosity and problem-solving to devices. My forced digital detox reminded me that the most reliable technology we have is our own intuition and the willingness to talk to the person next to us. Sometimes, the best connection isn't Wi-Fi; it's the one right in front of you.
