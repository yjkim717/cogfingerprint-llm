"Upgrading My Home Network for the Future"

As I settled into my new home, I realized it was time to revisit my home network setup. My old prosumer router, a relic from my tech-enthusiast days, was still holding up, but I knew it was time for an upgrade. Having cut my teeth on enterprise-grade equipment, I was spoiled by the reliability and features it offered. However, I'm now on a quest to find a more affordable and straightforward solution that doesn't break the bank.

With Verizon Fios as my ISP, I'm on the hunt for a router that can keep up with my household's growing demands for speed and connectivity. I'm trading in my old love for complex networking gear for something more plug-and-play. Wish me luck on my search for the perfect, hassle-free Wi-Fi experience!
