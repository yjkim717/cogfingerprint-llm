"As a Slovenian Shopify merchant in 2023, I've struggled to find a payment processor that truly understands European customers. I've turned to Mollie, which supports local payment methods like Klarna and Bancontact. It's been a game-changer - my checkout process is smoother, and customers are more confident. I'm excited to see how this integration continues to improve my online shop's performance."
