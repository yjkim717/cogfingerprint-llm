There’s a moment in my scrolling today—endless feeds, curated lives, and sanitized violence—that reminded me of J.G. Ballard’s *The Atrocity Exhibition*. Reading it felt like watching Pynchon try on Burroughs’ skin: a chaotic, 1970s vision of sex fused with machine, of media as trauma.

It’s 2023, and that fiction feels less like speculation and more like prophecy. We’re living inside the collision of desire and device, where every screen delivers intimacy and annihilation in the same breath. I catch myself numb to the horror, addicted to the image. Ballard wasn’t just writing fiction; he was handing us a mirror. And honestly? I’m not sure I like what’s staring back.
