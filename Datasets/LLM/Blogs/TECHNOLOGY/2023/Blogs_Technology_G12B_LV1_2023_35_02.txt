## Glitching Through the Noise

It’s funny, isn't it? How quickly the shiny new becomes the background hum. I remember the breathless excitement around early smartphones – the promise of instant connection, a world in your pocket. Now? They're just…there. Like a constant, low-level tremor in reality.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about Thomas Pynchon’s *Gravity's Rainbow* and *The Atrocity Exhibition*, those sprawling, paranoid narratives where technology isn't progress, but a monstrous, unknowable force. It’s a feeling that echoes a little too loudly these days. We’re bombarded with algorithms, AI-generated everything, and a constant stream of data, all blurring together. 

Sometimes, I feel like I’m just glitching through the noise, desperately searching for something real beyond the screen. Maybe that's just me, needing a digital detox, but isn't there something unsettling about how seamlessly we've integrated ourselves into the machine?
