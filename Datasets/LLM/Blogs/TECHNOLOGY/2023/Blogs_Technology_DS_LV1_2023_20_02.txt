The consent form felt heavy in my hands. "Cyst removal surgery." Two lines of text, a lifetime of anxiety. At 23, my body feels like a collection of problems, and this is just the latest. The doctor explained the low risks, but my brain only heard the words "complication" and "anesthesia." It’s not the pain I fear most; it’s the quiet, terrifying thought that this routine procedure could be the one in a million. I’ve spent weeks in a pre-op spiral, researching everything, trying to prepare for a moment of vulnerability I can’t control. My mortality, usually a distant concept, is now sitting right beside me in this sterile room, asking for a signature. Taking a deep breath, I pick up the pen. This is about taking back control, one scary step at a time.

And here is a reflective blog post about technology for 2023.

Remember the promise of the "smart home"? In 2023, mine staged a mutiny. It started subtly. My lights would flicker at 3 AM for no reason. My smart speaker, asked for the weather, would instead play heavy metal. I felt like I was living in a passive-aggressive tech thriller.

The breaking point was the thermostat. I’d set it to a cozy 72°, only to find it had "learned" I preferred an arctic 65°. Shivering, I realized the problem: I’d outsourced my comfort to algorithms that didn’t know me.

So, I did the unthinkable. I manually turned the dial. The quiet *click* was more satisfying than any voice command. I’ve started pulling back, reclaiming small analog victories. The tech is still here, but now it’s a tool, not the boss. Sometimes, the smartest home is one that just listens to you.
