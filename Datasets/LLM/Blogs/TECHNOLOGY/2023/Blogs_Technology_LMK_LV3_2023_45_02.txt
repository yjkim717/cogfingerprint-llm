As I dove into Kotlin development in 2023, I stumbled upon a quirk that left me puzzled. When using a custom infix function with KProperty, the compiler surprisingly didn't enforce type checks. This got me thinking - are we relying too heavily on the compiler to catch our mistakes? I've come to realize that understanding the intricacies of Kotlin's generics and type checking is crucial. By exploring this issue, I've gained a deeper appreciation for the language's subtleties and the importance of thorough testing.
