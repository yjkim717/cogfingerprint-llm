**Lost in the Man Pages**

There’s something wonderfully frustrating about getting stuck on a tiny detail in a manual. I was wrestling with bspwm the other day, staring at a man page and completely baffled by symbols like '.' and '#'. It felt like deciphering an alien language!

We all get lost in the weeds sometimes.
