Remember sketching my first system diagram back in 2023? I thought neat boxes and arrows were enough. But as projects grew, I realized—architecture isn’t just about diagrams; it’s about clarity, collaboration, and anticipating change. Now, I focus on clear design docs and shared understanding. It’s less about perfect visuals, more about building systems that evolve with us. What’s your go-to practice for keeping designs resilient?
