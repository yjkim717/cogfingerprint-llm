I remember when I first heard about AI art generators in 2023. It felt like magicâ€”type a few words and watch masterpieces appear. But after creating hundreds of images, I realized something was missing. The process felt hollow, like ordering takeout instead of cooking. The real beauty, I learned, wasn't in the final picture, but in the messy, human journey of making it myself.
