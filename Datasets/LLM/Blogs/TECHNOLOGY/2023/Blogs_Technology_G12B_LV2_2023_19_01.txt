## The Algorithm Knows Me Better Than I Do?

It’s wild, isn’t it? How streaming services *just know* what I want to watch next. Last night, after a deep dive into documentaries about space exploration, my recommendations were…vintage sci-fi. Seriously! It felt a little unsettling, this echo of my subconscious interests. 

It got me thinking – are algorithms subtly shaping our tastes, or are they just brilliantly reflecting what’s already there? Maybe they’re holding up a mirror, showing us aspects of ourselves we haven’t quite articulated yet. A little spooky, a little fascinating.
