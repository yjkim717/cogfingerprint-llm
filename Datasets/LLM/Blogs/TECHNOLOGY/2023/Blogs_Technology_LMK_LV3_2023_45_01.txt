As I dove into the world of cryptography and blockchain in 2023, I stumbled upon an idea that felt revolutionary. But, upon further research, I discovered the FROST protocol, which eerily mirrored my concept. Initially, I felt a pang of disappointment, thinking I'd been beaten to the punch. However, upon reflection, I realized that my idea was still worth exploring. If I'd pushed it further, I could have contributed meaningfully to the field of threshold signatures and cryptocurrency. This experience taught me that even when ideas aren't entirely new, there's still value in developing them.
