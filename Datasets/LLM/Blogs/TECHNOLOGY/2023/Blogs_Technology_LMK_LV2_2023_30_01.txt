The rental landscape is getting crazier by the day! I recently had a frustrating experience with a broker asking me to inflate my broker fee bid for a rent-stabilized apartment. It got me thinking - are we relying too heavily on tech to navigate the rental market? In 2023, shouldn't we have more transparent and fair systems in place? As I navigated the rental application process, I couldn't help but wonder: are we trading convenience for fairness?
