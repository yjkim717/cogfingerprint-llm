There I was, sipping my coffee in 2023, convinced my Kotlin infix function was a stroke of genius—clean, concise code to set properties. I’d embraced generics for flexibility, trusting the compiler’s type safety to catch my slip-ups. But then it happened: I passed a String where an Int belonged, and… silence. No red squiggles, no angry errors. My assumption of airtight safety shattered. It’s a humbling reminder that even in our most elegant solutions, we must stay vigilant; the compiler isn’t always the guardian we imagine.
