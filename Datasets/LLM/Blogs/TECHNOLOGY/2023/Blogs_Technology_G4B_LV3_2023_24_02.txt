**The Ghost in the Machine – And Why It’s Messing With My Reflexes**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2023 has felt like a constant, low-grade anxiety about adapting. It’s not just the world outside, but the tech inside too. I’ve been diving back into CS:GO, something I used to just *do*, a natural extension of my muscle memory. But CS2? It’s… different. 

I’m a veteran, right? I’ve spent years building those lightning-fast flicks, mastering spray patterns. Now, this new sub-tick system – it's like the game is subtly shifting the ground beneath my feet. It throws off my tracking, makes my body sway in ways it never did before. 

It’s frustrating, really. It feels like a ghost in the machine, a tiny alteration that’s fundamentally changing how I interact with something I was so comfortable with.  It’s a reminder that even the things we’ve honed over time, the skills we’ve built, need to be constantly revisited and adjusted.  Maybe it’s just me, but it feels like a surprisingly poignant lesson in letting go and embracing the inevitable evolution of technology – and ourselves.
