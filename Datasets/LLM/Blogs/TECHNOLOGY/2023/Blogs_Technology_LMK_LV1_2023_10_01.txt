"I'm still trying to figure out why my smart window's double glazing has become so hazy. At first, I thought it was just dirt on the surface, but after cleaning, the fogginess between the panes remained. I suspect a broken seal is to blame, allowing condensation and dirt to seep in over time. It's a frustrating issue in 2023, where energy efficiency is key. Guess I'll be looking into window replacement sooner rather than later!"
