The joys of upgrading to a new game version. For CS enthusiasts like myself, the transition from CSGO to CS2 was supposed to be a seamless one. But, boy, was I wrong. As I dived into the new game, I was hit with a harsh reality - my aim was off. Like, really off. I'm talking flicks that used to be second nature now sailing off into nowhere, and spray control that felt like trying to tame a wild beast.

At first, I blamed my hardware. Maybe my old mouse just couldn't keep up with the new game's demands? But, after tweaking my settings and upgrading my peripherals, the problem persisted. That's when I stumbled upon the truth - CS2's sub-tick mechanics were the culprit. In CSGO, I had developed muscle memory that relied on the old tickrate. The new sub-tick system, while promising more precise tracking, was throwing my aim out of whack.

As I struggled to adjust, I realized that it wasn't just me. Fellow players were facing the same issues, and the community was abuzz with frustration. The consensus? CS2's new mechanics required a fundamental relearning of aiming techniques. It was like trying to relearn how to ride a bike - except the bike was now moving at breakneck speeds, and the road was paved with pixelated bullets.

It's been a few weeks since I made the switch, and I'm still getting used to the new dynamics. My aim is improving, slowly but surely. If you're a fellow CSGO refugee struggling to find your bearings in CS2, don't worry - you're not alone. And to the devs, I say this: while the new sub-tick mechanics may be a game-changer, a bit more guidance on adjusting to them wouldn't go amiss.
