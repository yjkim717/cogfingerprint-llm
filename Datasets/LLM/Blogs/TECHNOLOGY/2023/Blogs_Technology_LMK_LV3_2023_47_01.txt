The struggle is real when setting up a test environment in virtual machines! I've recently found myself wrestling with configuring a NAT network in both VMWare and Virtual Box. The goal was simple: get my virtual machines talking to the host and each other. But, as often happens, the reality was more complicated. The differences in network connectivity between the two platforms had me scratching my head. In 2023, you'd think it'd be easier to get VMs up and running, but the nuances of virtual machine configuration still catch me off guard. Through trial and error, I finally got my test environment humming. The experience was a great reminder that even with the advancements in tech, sometimes it's the fundamentals that need attention. Now, I'm paying it forward by sharing my learnings â€“ so you don't have to pull your hair out too!
