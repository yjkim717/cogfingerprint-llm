It’s 2023, and the job market feels like a high-stakes balancing act. I love the clean, flexible feel of Vue, and I’ll admit, I’ve been wary of jumping on the TypeScript train—sometimes I just want to build without the extra steps. But practicality has a way of nudging you. I’ve been eyeing more backend roles, and seeing the steady demand for Rails and Python is a reality check. It’s that classic tug-of-war: holding onto the tools that feel right while reaching for the ones that promise a stable paycheck. In the end, it’s not just about code; it’s about crafting a career that lasts.
