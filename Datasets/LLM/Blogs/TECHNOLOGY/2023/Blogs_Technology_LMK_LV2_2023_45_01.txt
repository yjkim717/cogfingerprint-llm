"Revisiting My Crypto Idea: A Lesson in Humility. As I dug into the FROST protocol in 2023, I was struck by its similarity to a concept I'd brainstormed months prior. Upon reflection, I realized that while my idea was on the right track, it lacked the finesse of FROST's threshold signature scheme and commitment scheme. If I'd built upon my initial thoughts, I might have created something remarkable. This experience taught me that even when my ideas aren't entirely original, there's value in refining them to create something truly innovative."
