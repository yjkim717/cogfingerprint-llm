**The Dark Side of Blue Light (and My Sleep Crisis)**

Okay, real talk: 2023 feels like a constant battle against the glow. We’re *obsessed* with screens – phones, tablets, laptops – and it’s honestly taking a toll. I recently realized I was staring at my phone until the early hours, desperately trying to catch up on emails and social media.  

It completely wrecked my sleep. I started feeling sluggish, irritable, and honestly, just *tired* all the time.  I’d tried everything – meditation, chamomile tea – but nothing seemed to stick.  

Then, I remembered my grandmother’s advice about blackout curtains. Seriously! I’m currently on a mission to find the perfect window coverings, hoping to block out the digital world and finally get some proper rest.  It’s a small thing, but maybe a good reminder that sometimes, the simplest solutions are the best.
