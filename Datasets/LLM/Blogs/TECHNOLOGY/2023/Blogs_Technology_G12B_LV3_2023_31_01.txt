## Does My Dinner Plate Exist Fully? A Weird Thought I Can't Shake

Okay, hear me out. I was reading something the other day – some seriously mind-bending physics stuff about time dilation and, strangely, mass – and it got me thinking about something I've been circling around for a while: the simulation hypothesis. 

The idea, as you probably know, is that we're living in a highly advanced computer simulation. Sounds crazy, right? But what if the resources needed to *render* our reality aren't infinite? What if things with more “mass,” or even just a larger *surface area* (think, a sprawling forest versus a single pebble), require more computational power to simulate accurately? 

Suddenly, the way I experience time felt… different. Does my dinner plate get the same level of detail as, say, a distant galaxy? Is my lived experience prioritized because I'm *me*, or because it simply demands more processing power? 

It's a rabbit hole, I know. But in 2023, surrounded by ever-increasing technological advancements, it's hard *not* to wonder if reality is just a really, *really* good program. Anyone else having these late-night existential tech spirals?
