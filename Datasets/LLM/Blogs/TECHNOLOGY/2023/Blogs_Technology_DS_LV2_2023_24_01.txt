It’s funny how history can sneak up on you. Just last week, I was playing a historical strategy game, maneuvering European armies across pixelated battlefields, when it hit me: how much of their dominance came from better swords and guns, and how much from the sheer chaos of endless border squabbles? It’s a question that echoes today.

In 2023, we’re surrounded by our own technological leaps—AI, quantum computing, you name it. But are we innovating for the sake of progress, or are we, like those old empires, driven by the silent pressures of modern conflicts and competition? It makes me wonder if necessity isn’t just the mother of invention, but its relentless, often unseen, drill sergeant. Maybe the past isn’t so distant after all.
