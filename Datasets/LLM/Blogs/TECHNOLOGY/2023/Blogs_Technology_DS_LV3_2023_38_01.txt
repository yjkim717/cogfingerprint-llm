Ever since I stumbled upon PandasAI, that clever Python tool that spins data into insights with a whisper of generative AI, I’ve been wondering: is there an R equivalent? As someone who lives and breathes data analysis, I dream of asking my R console in plain English—not just for a plot or a dataframe, but to run statistical tests or even build a regression model. In 2023, shouldn’t our tools understand not just our data, but us? The future of coding feels beautifully human.
