## Disconnecting to Reconnect: Trading Pixels for Paddles This Summer

It feels like 2023 has been a non-stop blur of screens, doesn't it? Between work emails and endless scrolling, I’ve been craving something… real. So, we're planning a family adventure this summer – a multi-day canoe trip down the Yukon River, starting near Whitehorse. My teens are surprisingly excited!

Finding a good outfitter has been key, and it's got me thinking: sometimes the best way to recharge isn’t another app, but a complete digital detox. Trading pixels for paddles feels like exactly what we need to reconnect with each other and the wild beauty of the Yukon. Wish us luck!
