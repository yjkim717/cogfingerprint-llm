I still remember the frustration I felt when my brand-new 2022 Jayco SLX started leaking. It was like having a persistent companion that I couldn't shake off. As I navigated the world of RV issues, I began to realize that technology, like my RV, can be flawed. In 2023, we're more reliant on tech than ever, but what happens when it fails us? For me, it was a leaky slide that led me down the rabbit hole of lemon law and trailer problems. Has technology ever let you down?
