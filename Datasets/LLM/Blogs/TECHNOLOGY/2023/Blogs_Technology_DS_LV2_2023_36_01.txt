The other day, I was helping my uncle in rural Provence decide between a diesel or hybrid Citroën C5 Aircross. It struck me how this choice mirrors our broader dance with technology. We’re all navigating this shift—clinging to the reliable “diesel” of our old habits while cautiously stepping toward the “hybrid” future. In 2023, every update and new gadget feels like choosing a motorisation: do we prioritize the familiar, or embrace the evolving, greener path? It’s not just about cars; it’s about how we move through a changing world, one thoughtful decision at a time.
