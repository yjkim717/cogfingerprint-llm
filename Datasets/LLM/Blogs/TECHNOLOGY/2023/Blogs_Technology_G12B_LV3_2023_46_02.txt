## The Frankenstein Script and the Quest for Automation (A PowerShell Tale)

Okay, let's be honest, we've all been there. Staring at a script cobbled together from various online sources, a digital Frankenstein's monster of code, hoping it *just works*. That’s been my week. I'm diving into PowerShell to automate a simple file transfer – pulling files from an FTP server and dropping them into a local share. 

The initial script? A chaotic mix of Google searches and ChatGPT suggestions. It *sort of* worked, but lacked a crucial check: does the file even *exist* on the FTP server before I try to grab it? 

Now, I'm wrestling with conditional logic, trying to build in that vital safeguard. The goal? Seamless automation through Task Scheduler. It's a humbling reminder that even with powerful tools like PowerShell, sometimes the best code is the code you understand, and that takes a little more than just copy-pasting!
