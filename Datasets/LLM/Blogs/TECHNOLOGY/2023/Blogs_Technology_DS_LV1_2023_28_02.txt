### The Algorithm and the Human: What We Miss When We Only See the Code

It was the summer of “Barbenheimer,” and I found myself in a familiar spot: scrolling through endless takes. One side argued a film was a feminist masterpiece; the other dismissed it as anti-man propaganda. Another side debated a biopic as a sobering warning; its opposition called it a glorification of a monster. I realized we weren’t just watching movies; we were watching two-hour Rohrschach tests. And it got me thinking about the tech we build and use every day.

We often treat technology like those reductive film critics. We see an algorithm and label it: "efficient," "biased," "addictive." We see a new AI tool and declare it either the saviour of productivity or the harbinger of the apocalypse. In our rush to judge, we miss the nuanced, deeply human story underneath.

Take the social media feed. It’s easy to vilify it as a soul-sucking machine designed for engagement. That’s one perspective. But what about the small business owner in a rural town who found their entire customer base through local groups? Or the support network for people with rare diseases that literally could not exist without it? The technology itself is a complex legacy, a tool of both connection and isolation. Its moral weight isn't in its code, but in our hands.

The lesson from Barbie and Oppenheimer isn’t about plastic or plutonium; it’s about perspective. A single story is never the whole truth. As we hurtle further into an AI-driven 2023, we must resist the simple labels. The next time you interact with a piece of technology, try to see its dual nature. See the potential for good and the capacity for harm, not as a contradiction, but as its inherent, complicated reality. The most insightful critique—of a film or a platform—is the one that holds multiple truths at once. Our future may depend on that nuanced view.
