It’s funny how old tech finds new life. I recently bundled my aging Intel i7-6700 and ASRock H110M-ITX with 16GB of DDR3, listed it on Reddit, and it sold for $128. In 2023, it’s a reminder that someone’s outdated gear is another’s perfect starter build. Letting it go felt less like a sale and more like passing on a legacy.
