**Swipe Right on Criticism? My Thoughts on Online Dating & Expectations**

Okay, let’s be real – 2023 and online dating feels… exhausting. I’ve been wading through a frankly alarming amount of commentary on dating apps lately, and I’m starting to feel like we’ve collectively decided that judging other people’s partners is a *vital* part of the experience. 

I recently scrolled through a thread where a woman was absolutely dismantling a guy’s choice of girlfriend – calling her “immature” and suggesting it was a sign of a fundamentally flawed relationship. Honestly, it triggered something in me. It felt…aggressive. And, frankly, a little exhausting to witness. 

I get it. We’re all wired to want the best for people we care about. But there’s a massive difference between offering constructive feedback and launching a full-blown critique from the comfort of your phone. It’s easy to project our own relationship anxieties onto someone else’s choice, isn’t it? 

I think a lot of this stems from the pressure of presenting a curated version of ourselves online – the ‘perfect’ partner, the ‘ideal’ life. It creates a weird expectation that everyone else’s choices *should* align with that fantasy. 

Maybe, just maybe, if we spent a little less time judging and a little more time understanding, we’d actually build healthier relationships – both online and off.  It’s a thought, anyway. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go log off and actually *talk* to someone.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, add a specific anecdote, or focus on a particular aspect)?
