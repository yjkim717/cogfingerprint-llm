Missed a message? But a funny thing happened. I noticed the details of my neighborhood, had a spontaneous conversation with a stranger at a coffee shop, and actually finished a book. The technology wasn't the enemy, but my dependence on it was. I learned that sometimes, you have to disconnect to truly connect with the world, and yourself.
