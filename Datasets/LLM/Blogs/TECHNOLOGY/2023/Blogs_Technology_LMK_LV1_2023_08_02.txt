As I logged into the company's latest online disability support event, a recording of a previous discussion, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. As someone with Asperger's, I've learned to appreciate safe spaces, but this felt different. The corporate setting, though well-intentioned, seemed to blur the lines between support and surveillance. In 2023, where technology has made connections easier, I wondered if we were trading genuine understanding for convenience. Was this online event truly a safe haven, or just a step towards more 'inclusive' corporate protocol?
