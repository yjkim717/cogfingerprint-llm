Living in a tight-knit town, I’ve always been wary of online dating. The last thing I want is to awkwardly bump into someone at the farmers’ market who already swiped left on my profile. That’s why I’ve been dreaming of an app designed for small communities—one where profiles stay anonymous until both parties agree to reveal themselves at the same time.

Imagine the fairness: no more ghosting once you see who’s behind the screen, and no one-sided vulnerability. In 2023, we have the tech to make dating feel human again—not like a game of hide-and-seek. It’s about bringing back genuine connection, one mutual click at a time.
