"As a remote teacher in 2023, I'm always on the lookout for tools that facilitate seamless interaction with my students. I've been exploring WeChat for video chat and screen sharing, and I'm curious - can it also handle collaborative document editing? I'd love to hear from fellow educators: have you used WeChat for remote teaching, and if so, what are your experiences with its collaboration features?"
