## The Algorithm Knows Me Better Than I Know Myself?

It’s a weird feeling, isn't it? Scrolling through TikTok, and it's like the algorithm *gets* you. It’s eerily accurate. Lately, I've been pondering this, much like a Reddit thread I stumbled upon discussing Harry Potter and Boggarts. The question was, why would Harry’s biggest fear be Voldemort, when he’d barely encountered him? 

It made me think about our own digital fears. Are we confronting the truly scary stuff – our anxieties about connection, purpose, or even just *being seen* – or are we just reacting to the curated content shoved in front of us? Maybe the algorithm isn't reflecting our deepest fears, but rather, amplifying what we already consume. A little unsettling, right?
