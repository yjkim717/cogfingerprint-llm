It’s 2023, and I’ve tried every “smart” sleep gadget out there—trackers, white noise apps, even a sunrise-simulating alarm clock. But nothing prepared me for the rude awakening when I moved and had to ditch my old, custom-fabricated blackout curtains. Suddenly, my sleep quality plummeted. Streetlights, early sunrises—every sliver of light felt like an intrusion.

You don’t realize how much light sensitivity affects you until you’re squinting at 5 a.m., desperately layering blankets over cheap “blackout” curtains that barely dim the glow. I’d taken true light blocking for granted. Now, I’m back to researching custom options, because in our tech-saturated lives, sometimes the simplest, most analog solution—total darkness—is what lets you truly recharge.
