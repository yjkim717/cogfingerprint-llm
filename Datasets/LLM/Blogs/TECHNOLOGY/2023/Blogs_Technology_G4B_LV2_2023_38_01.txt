**The AI Data Dream: R Wants a Piece of the Pandas Action**

It’s wild, isn’t it?  Just a few years ago, “AI-powered dataframes” felt like something out of a sci-fi movie. But with tools like PandasAI, Python’s making it surprisingly easy to conjure datasets with a few prompts. I’ve been diving deep, and I’m hearing a strong desire for this in R – a real yearning for an R equivalent.
