Remember when we used to get lost on purpose? Last week, my daughter asked Siri for directions to our neighborhood park. It hit me—we’ve outsourced discovery to algorithms. In 2023, technology connects us globally yet distances us from our own streets. I’ve started leaving my phone behind on evening walks, relearning the quiet joy of unguided exploration. Sometimes getting lost is the only way to truly find where you are.
