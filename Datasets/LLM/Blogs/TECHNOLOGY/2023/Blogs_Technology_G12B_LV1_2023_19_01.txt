>## The Algorithm's Shadow

It's funny, isn't it? How reliant we've become on these digital oracles. My phone suggests news, Spotify curates my music, even my grocery list feels algorithm-approved. It's all incredibly convenient, yet a little unsettling. 

Recently, I realized I was reaching for my phone *before* I even knew what I wanted. A subconscious dependence. It made me think of Harry Potter and the Boggart â€“ that creature reflecting our deepest fears. What would *my* digital Boggart be? Probably a notification saying "Irrelevant." The fear of fading, of being lost in the endless scroll. Maybe we all have one, lurking in the data stream. A chilling thought, isn't it?
