It’s funny how a single notification can unravel an entire evening. Last night, I was deep into a gripping novel on my e-reader, the soft glow a perfect companion to the quiet—until my phone buzzed with a “breaking news” alert. Instantly, my focus shattered. I spent the next hour scrolling, my book forgotten, my mind buzzing with information I didn’t really need.

In 2023, we’ve mastered the art of connection, yet I’ve never felt more disconnected from moments of genuine peace. My devices, designed to streamline life, often end up hijacking it. I’m learning that true tech-savviness isn’t about using every feature available; it’s about knowing when to switch it all off and reclaim the silence. Sometimes, the most advanced setting is the power button.
