## When Kotlin Fooled Me (and the Compiler?)

Okay, I'll admit it: I had a moment of head-scratching this week. Working with KProperties in Kotlin, I expected the usual rock-solid type safety we all love. But then… a `Long` slipped through and got assigned to a `String` property! It felt like the compiler momentarily forgot its job. It's a small thing, but it’s a good reminder that even with powerful tools like Kotlin's generics, we still need to be vigilant in 2023. Anyone else ever encounter something similar?
