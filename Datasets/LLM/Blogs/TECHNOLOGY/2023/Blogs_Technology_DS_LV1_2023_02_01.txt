**The High Cost of a "Smart" Checkout**

It was supposed to be simple. Last month, I used a "Smart Pay" option to order a new phone. One click, and it was doneâ€”or so I thought. The next day, my bank account was $800 lighter.

When I tried to cancel, I hit a digital brick wall. No option, no direct line, just automated replies. The support agent, when I finally got one, gave me the straight talk: a refund would take up to 30 days to process. My money is now stuck in a dispute, and I'm left waiting.

In 2023, technology promises frictionless living, but this experience was a stark reminder. The very systems designed for convenience can create the most frustrating and costly human delays. Sometimes, the smartest payment is the one you think twice about.
