## Does "Safe Space" Still Mean Anything Online?

Something felt off during a recent work event – a Zoom gathering for our disability employee group. We were prompted to record, and honestly, a little knot of unease tightened in my stomach. Is this *really* a safe space if everything’s being documented?

It got me thinking. We throw around terms like "safe space" a lot online, but in 2023, with every platform tracking and potentially archiving, can we truly achieve that? It’s a tricky balance – connection and community versus vulnerability and privacy. I'm still pondering it, and wondering if we need a new language to describe what we’re striving for.
