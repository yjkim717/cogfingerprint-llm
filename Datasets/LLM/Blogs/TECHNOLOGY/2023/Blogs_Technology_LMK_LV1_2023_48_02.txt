As I navigate the frontend job market in 2023, I'm struck by the ubiquity of TypeScript. Whether it's Rails or Python-backed applications, TypeScript seems to be the go-to choice for many teams, especially those using Vue. I've noticed that companies are increasingly looking for developers with expertise in this statically-typed language. It's clear that TypeScript has become a de facto standard in the industry. As I consider my own career prospects, I'm weighing the benefits of honing my TypeScript skills to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving job market.
