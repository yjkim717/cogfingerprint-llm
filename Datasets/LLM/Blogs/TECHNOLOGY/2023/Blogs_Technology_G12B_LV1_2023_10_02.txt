>## Are We Still Measuring Success by the Wrong Numbers?

Remember when everyone obsessed over follower counts? Instagram likes were the ultimate validation, and a rapidly growing Klout score felt like career gold. Back in 2013, it seemed like the more numbers you had, the more successful you were. 

But lately, I’ve been questioning that whole premise. Scrolling through perfectly curated feeds, I realized I was comparing my behind-the-scenes reality to everyone else’s highlight reel.  It felt… hollow.

It reminds me of those old mortgage rules – focusing solely on gross income instead of what’s *actually* left after bills.  Are we doing the same thing with social media? Are we chasing vanity metrics instead of measuring what genuinely matters – meaningful connections, creative fulfillment, and real-world impact? 

Maybe it's time to shift the focus. Less chasing numbers, more building something real. What do you think?
