**The Algorithm Said “Wait” – And I Almost Lost My Cool**

Okay, so this happened last week, and honestly, it’s been rattling around in my head ever since. I was applying for a digital nomad co-living space in Berlin – you know, the dream, right? A beautiful apartment, a community, the freedom to travel… the whole shebang. 

I filled out the application, answered all the questions, and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, an email: “We’re so sorry, but due to high demand, you’ve been placed on the waiting list.” 

It felt… strangely impersonal. Like I’d just entered a data point into some giant algorithm.  I started thinking about all the endless waiting lists we deal with these days – from housing to healthcare, even just getting a decent response to an email. 

It’s easy to get frustrated, to feel like you’re just another number.  I almost sent a fiery, passive-aggressive reply, demanding to know *why* my application wasn't prioritized. But then I remembered my grandma’s advice: “Sometimes, the best response is patience.” 

This whole experience made me think about how technology, meant to connect us, can sometimes feel like it's just creating more layers of distance and delay.  It’s a reminder to breathe, and to remember that waiting, however frustrating, doesn’t necessarily mean you’re forgotten.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
