### The Great London Broadband Hunt

Moving to London in 2023, I was ready for the rain, the rent, and the rush. What I wasn't prepared for was the broadband black hole. As a remote worker, my livelihood depends on a stable connection, and my new flat’s promised "superfast" broadband turned out to be anything but. Endless buffering and dropped Zoom calls became my new, stressful normal.

My quest began. Every broadband deal I researched for my area seemed like a gamble with my career. That’s when I started looking up—literally. I kept hearing about 5G. Could a mobile signal really save my job?

I decided to test a 5G WiFi (MiFi) device. Skeptical, I plugged it in. The difference was instant. Suddenly, I had speeds that my wired connection could only dream of, turning my kitchen table into a proper command centre. It was a stark reminder that sometimes the future isn't buried under the pavement; it’s floating in the air, and in a city like London, it just might be the key to staying connected.
