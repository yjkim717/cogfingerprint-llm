## That Mind Flayer Power Though... and the Fear of Tech Overload

Okay, so I've been utterly captivated by *Baldur's Gate 3* – especially the Illithid powers. The idea of tapping into that psychic potential is *amazing*. But a thread on Reddit got me thinking. What if those powers, like some new, shiny tech, actually disrupt the flow? 

We’re constantly bombarded with new apps, devices, features… it's exciting, sure, but also a little overwhelming. Will embracing *all* the Illithid abilities, or constantly chasing the latest gadget, ultimately dilute the core experience? It's a fascinating parallel, and a good reminder to choose wisely.
