It’s 2023, and I’ve been paying annual fees to housing associations in Copenhagen for years, hoping to someday land an affordable apartment in this beautiful, bustling city. But lately, I’ve been wondering: is this digital waiting list just another form of long-term commitment I’m not ready for?

When I first signed up, it felt like a smart move—a small yearly fee for a shot at stability in a market where prices seem to climb endlessly. But as the years tick by, the reality sinks in: I might not reach the top of that list until I’m in my 60s. That’s decades of payments, all for a "maybe." It’s a renewal dilemma that hits hard every time I get that automated email reminding me to update my preferences or pay up for another year.

Technology promised to simplify our lives, but sometimes it just gives us new ways to wait. I track my position in real-time, watch the numbers barely budge, and wonder if I’m investing in a future that’s more virtual than tangible. Housing affordability is a real struggle here, and these digital queues offer a glimmer of hope, but at what cost? Emotionally, it’s draining—like holding a lottery ticket where the draw happens in slow motion.

I’m not alone in this. Friends joke about our shared "apartment limbo," bonded by apps and dashboards that feed our dreams while testing our patience. In a world of instant gratification, this long game feels oddly archaic, wrapped in modern tech. So, I ask myself: do I keep betting on this digital future, or redirect that energy—and money—toward something more immediate? For now, I’m stuck in the wait, hoping the algorithm eventually favors me.
