It’s funny how technology evolves—sometimes in leaps, other times in quiet, steady steps. Just this year, I found myself reflecting on how much the tools we use shape not just what we build, but how we feel while building it.

Take Starlite’s recent v2.0 release, for example. I remember tinkering with earlier versions, appreciating its clean design but occasionally bumping into limitations. Now, with SQL Alchemy support baked in and performance that feels snappier, it’s like the framework has grown alongside my own projects. There’s something deeply satisfying about that kind of alignment—when the tools mature as you do.

And with a release candidate expected in March, it feels like we’re on the cusp of something even more polished. It reminds me that progress isn’t just about flashy features; it’s about refinement, about smoothing the rough edges so we can focus on what matters: creating.

In a world that often races ahead, it’s grounding to see technology meet us where we are—making the journey a little easier, one update at a time.
