It’s 2023, and I’m a software engineer who thrives on deep focus. But here’s the thing—my disability means that office noise isn’t just distracting; it’s a barrier to my work. So, I requested a $250 pair of noise-cancelling headphones, a simple tool that would let me code effectively and contribute fully.

You’d think it’d be straightforward. Our company has an accommodations policy, after all. But instead of support, I got pushback: “Is it really necessary?” or “Can’t you just try to focus harder?”

It’s frustrating. These headphones aren’t a luxury—they’re my lifeline to productivity, like a ramp for someone who uses a wheelchair. Technology has given us incredible ways to level the playing field, but it only works if we’re willing to embrace it. I hope sharing this sparks more open conversations about what true accessibility looks like in our digital-first workplaces.
