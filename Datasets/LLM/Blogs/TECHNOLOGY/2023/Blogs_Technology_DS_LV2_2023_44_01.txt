That old laptop of mine—the one with the cracked screen and a fan that whirred like a hairdryer—was my personal hiatal hernia. Every tech forum said it was terminal; a hardware flaw you just manage until replacement. I’d resigned myself to its sluggish protests.

Then, on a whim, I wiped it clean. No fancy tools, just a fresh 2023 OS install. The result wasn't just faster. It was… healed. The chronic crashes stopped. The fan fell silent.

It made me question the absolutes we’re so often told, in medicine or tech. Sometimes, systems just need us to stop treating the symptoms and instead, clear everything out for a real, unexpected recovery.
