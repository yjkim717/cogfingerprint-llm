As a streamer, I've learned that consistency is key to keeping my audience engaged. On off days, I create 'relaxed streams' with minimal effort, like playing chill games or just chatting. This low-key content helps me connect with my viewers on social media, build a loyal community, and boost my monetization without burning out.
