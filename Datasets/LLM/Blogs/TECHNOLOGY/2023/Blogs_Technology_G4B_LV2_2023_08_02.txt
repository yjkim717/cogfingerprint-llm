**The Zoom Safe Space Paradox**

Remember those Zoom meetings promising a ‘safe space’? Last month, I stumbled across a Reddit thread that really got me thinking. A user was attending a corporate disability event – supposedly a haven – and felt a deep unease. It was recorded, and the whole thing felt… performative. 

It hit a nerve. As someone with Asperger’s, the idea of a truly safe digital space is incredibly appealing. We crave understanding, but also a genuine lack of judgment. Yet, the very technology – the slick Zoom interface, the recording – felt like a barrier, a constant reminder of observation. 

Maybe the problem isn’t the platform, but the pressure to *appear* inclusive.  It’s a frustrating paradox, isn’t it?  We’re reaching for connection, but technology can sometimes feel like a spotlight instead of a shield.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the original summary?
