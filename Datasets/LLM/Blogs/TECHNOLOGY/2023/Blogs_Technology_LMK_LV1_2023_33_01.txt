**Taming the SSL Beast in My Homelab**

As I sat in front of my home lab setup, staring at the rows of humming servers and blinking routers, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. My little corner of the internet was finally starting to take shape. But, as I soon discovered, with great power comes great complexity. My latest hurdle? Getting SSL certs to work with my Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) and Duck DNS.

I've been using NPM to manage my home lab's services, and it's been a game-changer. But, when I tried to obtain SSL certs using Let's Encrypt, things got hairy. My services were exposed to the internet via Duck DNS, but NPM refused to play nice with the certs. I spent hours wrestling with configuration files, DNS settings, and Let's Encrypt's rate limits.

The breakthrough came when I realized I was overcomplicating things. A simple tweak to my Duck DNS settings, combined with a more nuanced understanding of NPM's configuration options, got the certs working in no time. My services were now secure, and I could finally breathe a sigh of relief.

The experience was a humbling reminder that, even in 2023, setting up a secure home lab can be a challenge. But, with persistence and a willingness to learn, even the most daunting tasks can be tamed. If you're struggling with similar issues, take heart â€“ you're not alone. And, if you're feeling adventurous, join me in the world of home labs, where the rewards are well worth the frustrations.
