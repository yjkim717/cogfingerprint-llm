As I settled into my new home in 2023, I realized it was time to reassess my home networking setup. My old enterprise-grade router, which had served me well in the past, now felt like overkill for my modest abode. I was on the hunt for a reliable and affordable prosumer router that could handle my family's internet needs. With Fios as my ISP, I was locked into using their provided hardware, but I wanted something more. I started researching top-notch wifi routers that could deliver seamless connectivity throughout my home. After weeks of reading reviews and comparing features, I finally found the perfect balance of performance and price. My new router has been a game-changer, providing fast and stable connections for all my devices. I'm loving the simplicity and ease of use it brings to my home network - a welcome change from the complexity of my old enterprise setup.
