The moment my ICLR paper was accepted, I felt a mix of triumph and dread. There it was—the “camera-ready” version, polished and final, yet I couldn’t help but notice a few lingering typos and a clunky paragraph. In 2023, with AI tools evolving daily, the pressure to perfect every detail is immense. I wondered: how much can we really change after acceptance, beyond mandatory reviewer fixes? It’s a delicate dance between improvement and overstepping, a reminder that in tech, our work is never truly “done”—it’s just ready for its next iteration.
