**The Flick Died a Little in CS2**

Okay, so I’ve been diving headfirst into CS2 this year, really trying to level up my aim. For years, flicking – those lightning-fast directional changes to land a perfect shot – was my bread and butter. I was *good* at it. Then… things started to feel off. 

I noticed my flicks weren't as crisp, as precise. It felt like I’d lose momentum mid-flick, a little stutter that completely ruined the shot. I started obsessing over it, blaming everything from my mousepad to my internet connection. 

Then it hit me: the sub-tick system. It’s wild how much it messes with your muscle memory. Suddenly, the timing felt… wrong. And the spray patterns? Forget about it! They’re so much wider, more unpredictable than in CS:GO. It’s like the game is actively fighting against you perfecting those smooth, controlled movements. 

It's a frustrating reminder that even the coolest new tech can subtly undermine what you’ve worked so hard to build.  Anyone else feeling this?
