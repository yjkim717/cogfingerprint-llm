### Relearning the Rhythm: A CS Veteran's Clash with CS2

For over a decade, my hands knew the dance. In CS:GO, counter-strafing was a breath, and spray control was pure muscle memory—a rhythm etched into my very nerves. I could flick to a corner and trust that my bullet would land exactly where my crosshair was, a split-second symphony of intention and action.

Then came 2023 and CS2 with its new sub-tick system. On paper, it’s technological progress, promising more precise input registration. In practice, for me, it’s been like trying to play a familiar song on an instrument that’s slightly out of tune.

My once-deadly AK spray now feels erratic, the consistency I built over thousands of hours seemingly gone. Those instinctive flicks? They whiff just enough to make me doubt myself. It’s a humbling experience. The game looks shinier, but my core skills feel disconnected, as if the technology changed the rules of physics on a dance floor I’ve known for years.

I’m not giving up, though. This is just a new, frustrating chapter in the learning process. It’s a stark reminder that in the world of tech and gaming, progress isn’t always a simple upgrade—sometimes, it’s a whole new language your muscles have to learn from scratch. Back to the workshop, I go.
