## The Algorithm of Waiting: Is My Effort Even Worth It?

It’s 2023, and we’re supposed to be living in an era of instant gratification. Order food with a tap, stream any movie ever made, connect with anyone across the globe in seconds. Yet, sometimes, I find myself caught in the digital equivalent of a Copenhagen housing association waiting list.

I’m talking about loyalty programs. Specifically, the one for my favorite online music platform. I’ve been a subscriber for *years*. I diligently collect points, religiously check for bonus offers, and even jumped through hoops to complete those annoying (but supposedly rewarding) profile quizzes. The promise? Early access to concert tickets, exclusive merchandise, the occasional discount.

But lately, I've been wondering... is it worth it?

The algorithm feels less like a reward system and more like a cleverly disguised delay tactic. I *finally* accumulate enough points for those concert tickets, and they’re sold out in five minutes. I save up for limited-edition headphones, only to discover they're a different model than advertised.

It’s oddly reminiscent of the stories my parents used to tell about waiting lists for public housing in Copenhagen – years of seniority, meticulously documented, only to feel like a gamble with little guarantee of return. The feeling of putting in the effort, strategizing, and still facing an endless queue is surprisingly similar.

Maybe I’m being cynical. But in a world obsessed with immediacy, I’m starting to question the value of these digital loyalty systems. Are they genuinely rewarding, or just expertly designed to keep us engaged, hoping for a reward that rarely materializes?  Perhaps it's time to reassess my digital investments and focus on experiences, not just points.

**Notes on how this relates to the source material:**

*   **Waiting Lists/Anciennitet:** The core concept of a long, seemingly endless wait for a reward is directly drawn from the housing association example. The idea of "seniority" (years of loyalty) is mirrored in the years of subscription to the music platform.
*   **Financial Waste:**  The questioning of whether the effort is worthwhile connects to the summary's concern about potential financial waste.
*   **Technology Context:** The post uses a modern, relatable example (loyalty programs) to explore the theme of delayed gratification in a digital age.
*   **Conversational Tone:**  The use of "I," personal anecdotes, and questions aims for a friendly, relatable style.
