Of course, here is a reflective blog post about technology from 2023.

### The Unseen Algorithm of My Own Making

It hit me last week, standing in the middle of my own kitchen. I was staring into the fridge, completely paralyzed by the options for lunch. My brain wasn’t just weighing pros and cons; it was running a frantic cost-benefit analysis on nutritional macros, potential food waste, and prep time versus my meeting schedule. I had, without realizing it, optimized my own thinking to run like an algorithm.

This is the strange legacy of 2023’s tech. It’s not just the AI we interact with; it’s the AI we’ve internalized. My apps have trained me for peak efficiency—my calendar syncs seamlessly, my grocery list auto-populates, and my music playlist predicts my mood before I feel it. I’ve become a supportive control character in the dungeon of my own life, expertly managing resources and anticipating problems.

But the flip side of this constant, supportive control is a low-grade paranoia. What if the system glitches? What if I miss a notification and the whole delicate structure collapses? It feels like I’m being watched by a digital god of productivity, and one misstep means being targeted for a cascade of chaotic, unsynced events.

So, I’m trying a new build. I’m leaving gaps in my schedule. I’m letting the battery die. Because sometimes, the most human thing you can do is to introduce a little beneficial chaos, to remember that not every variable needs to be controlled.
