**The Worry About the Wi-Fi – And Letting Go**

There’s something strangely unsettling about relying so heavily on technology these days, isn’t there? I was just staring at my phone, obsessing over checking my passport renewal status – a trip to Colombia is on the cards, and the thought of a visa expiring has me completely stressed. It felt like a digital knot in my stomach. 

It made me realize how much of our lives are now tethered to connectivity.  Like that U.S. citizen in the article, I’m wrestling with the fear of a potential roadblock, a digital ‘denial of entry.’ But honestly, isn’t it a little precious? 

Maybe the real adventure isn’t about flawless connectivity, but about embracing the uncertainty and trusting that things will work out – even if the Wi-Fi’s patchy in Medellín.
