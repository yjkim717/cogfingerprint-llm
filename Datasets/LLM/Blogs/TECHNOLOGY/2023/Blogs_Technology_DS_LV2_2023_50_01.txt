Last night, I found myself deep in a YouTube rabbit hole about Solfeggio frequenciesâ€”those ancient tones said to promote healing. As a musician, I was intrigued. Could I weave them into my electronic tracks?

Firing up Ableton Live, I grabbed Vital Synth and started tweaking MIDI notes, painstakingly detuning them to hit that perfect 528Hz. It was a meticulous process, but when the pure tone finally resonated through my headphones, a wave of calm washed over me. In our hyper-digital 2023, it felt like a small, personal act of technological alchemy.
