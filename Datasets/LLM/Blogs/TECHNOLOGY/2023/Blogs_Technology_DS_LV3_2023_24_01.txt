It’s funny how a late-night gaming session with friends got me thinking about something much bigger. We were playing a historical strategy game, maneuvering cannons and musket lines across digital European battlefields, when it hit me: what really gave these nations such an edge centuries ago?

Was it simply better guns and ships, or was it the constant, fierce competition over borders and trade routes that forced one breakthrough after another? In 2023, we see a similar drive in the race for AI and quantum computing—not born in a vacuum, but fueled by global tensions and rivalries.

It makes me wonder if true innovation isn't just about having the best tools, but about the high-stakes conflicts that make creating them a necessity. Sometimes, the past feels closer than we think.
