>## The ZFS Memory Myth and My Home Lab Headache

Okay, so I’ve been diving deep into ZFS for my home lab – a project I’m *really* enjoying, but also occasionally wrestling with. Lately, I've been obsessing over memory. You've probably heard the old chestnut: "1GB of RAM per TB of storage." It's a guideline, sure, but is it gospel?

I started wondering about that rule as I planned a new RAIDZ1 pool. Suddenly, I was calculating RAM needs based on *total* storage, not usable space. That felt...off. It's like budgeting for a car based on its maximum capacity, not how much you actually drive.

Turns out, it's more nuanced. While 1GB/TB is a decent starting point, ZFS's ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache) is a dynamic beast. It uses RAM aggressively to cache frequently accessed data, boosting performance. So, my actual RAM needs depend heavily on my workload. 

Right now, I'm experimenting, monitoring ARC usage, and honestly, feeling a little less stressed about the 1GB rule. It’s a learning curve, but a fascinating one! Anyone else battling ZFS memory management in their home lab? Let's commiserate (and share tips!) in the comments.
