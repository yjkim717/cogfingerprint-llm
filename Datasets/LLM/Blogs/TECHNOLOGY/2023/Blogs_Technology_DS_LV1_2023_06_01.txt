My 2013 Mazda3 isn't just a car; it's a character-filled project. Each weekend, I'm under the hood, learning its quirks. This ritual isn't about fixing a broken used carâ€”it's about honoring its journey. In our disposable tech era, this hands-on maintenance feels radical, a quiet commitment to longevity in a world always chasing the next new thing.
