As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in 2023, I'm left wondering: what's next for C, the venerable programming language that's been the backbone of so many innovations? If we were to reimagine C from scratch, ignoring the weight of legacy code, what would it look like? Could we introduce namespacing to tame the global namespace, or simplify type declarations to make the language more accessible? I'd love to hear your thoughts - let's rethink C and explore the possibilities together.
