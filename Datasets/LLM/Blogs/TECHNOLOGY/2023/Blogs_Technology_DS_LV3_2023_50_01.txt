Ever since diving into the Solfeggio frequencies hype in 2023, I wanted to weave that healing 528Hz tone into my music. The challenge? My MIDI notes in Ableton Live weren’t cooperating. After some tinkering, I discovered the power of pitch modification. I loaded up Vital synth, meticulously tweaking the fine-tuning until my note resonated at exactly 528Hz. Hearing that pure, intentional frequency bloom through my headphones was surreal—a small, personal tech triumph that blended science with soul, right from my digital studio.
