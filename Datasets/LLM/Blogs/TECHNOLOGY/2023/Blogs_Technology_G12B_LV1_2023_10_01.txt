>## The Ghost in the Glass

It's funny how everyday things can trigger bigger thoughts. I was staring at a window today, a persistent haze clouding the view. Turns out, the seal's gone, letting dust collect between the panes. Seems simple enough - replacement time. 

But it got me thinking about technology. We constantly upgrade, chase the newest model, discarding perfectly functional devices. Are we becoming a society of perpetually hazy windows, letting the dust of obsolescence settle in? Maybe it's time to appreciate what we have, repair and maintain, instead of always looking for the shiny, new replacement. Just a thought, as I wait for a window guy.
