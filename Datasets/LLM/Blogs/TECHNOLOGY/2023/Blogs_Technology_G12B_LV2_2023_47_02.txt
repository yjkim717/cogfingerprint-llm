## Lost in the Digital Woods (and Trying to Find Health Insurance!)

Anyone else feel like the internet sometimes actively *hates* us? I was just wrestling with Massachusetts health insurance options on mass.gov – a perfectly reasonable task, right? – and got completely lost. Google wasn't helping either, just spitting out a million irrelevant links. It’s 2023, and navigating basic services online should be easier! Just a reminder to breathe, and maybe call a friend for help when the digital forest feels too dense. We're all in this together.
