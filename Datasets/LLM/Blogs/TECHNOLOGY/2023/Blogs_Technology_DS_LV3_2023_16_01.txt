The Illithid powers in Baldur’s Gate 3 are a technological marvel in gameplay—so tempting, yet so morally gray. I’m torn between embracing their raw strength for my character’s progression and the nagging guilt over the narrative cost. Maybe the answer is an evil playthrough, where I can indulge in these mechanics without remorse. It’s a digital dilemma that mirrors real-life tech temptations: power versus principle.
