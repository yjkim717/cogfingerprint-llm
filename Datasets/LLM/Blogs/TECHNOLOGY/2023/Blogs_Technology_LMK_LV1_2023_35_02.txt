As I scroll through my feeds, I'm struck by how our digital lives eerily echo the dystopian visions of 1970s experimental fiction. Thomas Pynchon's paranoid landscapes and William Burroughs' cut-up narratives now feel prescient. The Atrocity Exhibition's dissection of image impact and Gravity's Rainbow's technocratic labyrinths resonate in today's social media-obsessed world. Are we trapped in a hall of mirrors, where reality's distorted by the algorithms that shape our perceptions?
