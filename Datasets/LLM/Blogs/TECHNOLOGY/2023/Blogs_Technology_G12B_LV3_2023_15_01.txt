## The Ghost of Perfect Sleep (and My Relationship with My Phone)

Remember that feeling of truly *deep* sleep? The kind where you wake up refreshed, not groggy? I had it a few years back, thanks to some custom blackout curtains. Seriously, those things were magic. Now, though, I'm battling a different kind of light pollution – the glow of my phone. 

It's 2023, and we're all tethered. Scrolling before bed, quick checks in the middle of the night… it’s a habit I know isn’t helping my sleep. It's funny, I solved one light problem with fabric, and now I'm fighting another with… well, technology itself. Maybe it's time to rediscover those blackout vibes, and a serious digital detox before bed. Anyone else feeling this disconnect?
