## The Algorithm Knows I Want a Home (But Does It Actually *Help*?)

Okay, let’s be real. Living in Copenhagen is amazing, but the housing situation? It’s… a journey. I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day discussing the endless waiting lists with KAB and AAB, and it hit me *hard*. We're talking 20-30 years, folks. And the fees just to stay on the list? Ouch. 

It got me thinking about how much we rely on algorithms these days, especially in 2023. We trust them with everything - recommending our next binge-watch, curating our news feeds, even predicting our shopping habits. But what about something as fundamental as finding a place to live?

I dutifully registered with KAB and AAB years ago, updating my “boligønsker” (housing wishes) every few months. It feels like shouting into the digital void. I input my preferences – location, size, budget – and the system dutifully logs it. But does it *actually* work? Does it understand the nuance of wanting a sunny balcony and a friendly neighbourhood? 

Maybe I'm being cynical. Maybe the algorithm *is* diligently sorting through thousands of applications. But right now, staring down the potential barrel of a decades-long wait, it feels a little like a sophisticated form of delayed gratification. A reminder that some things, even in our hyper-connected world, still require a whole lot of patience. And maybe, just maybe, a little bit of luck.
