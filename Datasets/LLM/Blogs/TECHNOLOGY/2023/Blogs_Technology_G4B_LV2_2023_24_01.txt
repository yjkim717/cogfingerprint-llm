**Pixels & Power: Why Do We Love Fighting in Games?**

Okay, let’s be honest – I’ve spent a *lot* of time lately lost in strategy games. And it’s struck me, weirdly, how obsessed we are with conflict, especially when it comes to Europe in these digital worlds. I was reading a piece the other day about how European powers historically dominated strategy games – and even real-world history – and it got me thinking. 

Was it simply superior military tech? Or was it something deeper? Maybe it's the *absence* of constant, widespread conflict that allowed them to focus on innovation and building empires. 

It's fascinating to see how these games reflect – and perhaps even shape – our understanding of power.  We build armies, wage wars, and strategize, all within a safe, pixelated space.  But isn’t there a little bit of us that’s still grappling with those same ancient questions about territory, and the drive to… well, dominate?  What do you think?
