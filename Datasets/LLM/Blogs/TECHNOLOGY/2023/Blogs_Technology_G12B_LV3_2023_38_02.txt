>## The Algorithm and the Ask: PhD Interviews & Taking Initiative in 2023

So, I’ve been fielding a lot of questions lately from folks gearing up for PhD interviews – specifically in neuroscience, with a dash of engineering thrown in. A common thread? The anxiety around reaching out *before* the interview itself. Should you email potential advisors to subtly (or not-so-subtly!) highlight your research alignment?

Honestly, it's a tricky one. Back in the day, it felt almost *wrong* to be so proactive. But 2023 feels different. We're all navigating a world mediated by algorithms, where visibility is key. A well-crafted email, demonstrating genuine interest and showcasing how your work connects with theirs, isn't necessarily pushy – it’s strategic.

It’s about cutting through the noise, showing you’ve done your homework, and sparking a connection *before* that interview room. Just remember, authenticity matters. Don't just parrot keywords; show you truly *get* their work. What are your thoughts? Are you reaching out, or sticking to the traditional approach?
