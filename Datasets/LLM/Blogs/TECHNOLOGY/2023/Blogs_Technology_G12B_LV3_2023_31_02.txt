## Building for Tomorrow, Today: Monoliths & the Microservices Dream

So, you're staring down a monolithic application? Don't feel bad, a *lot* of us are. We’re in 2023, and while microservices are the shiny new thing, sometimes you just need to *build* something. The question is, how do you build it *now* knowing you might want to break it down later?

I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately. It's especially tricky for smaller teams. You don't want to over-engineer a monolith, but you also don’t want to box yourself in. It’s a balancing act – modularity, clear boundaries, and a thoughtful design can lay the groundwork for a smoother migration to microservices down the road. It’s about planting seeds for the future, while delivering today. What are your thoughts?
