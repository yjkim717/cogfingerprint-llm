"Frustrating Encounters in Elden Ring: A Sign Placement Saga. I spent hours in Elden Ring fine-tuning my settings, only to be stumped by the duelist's furled finger issue. Despite using the furlcalling finger remedy, I couldn't place a sign for my other character. The character transfer process was smooth, but the usage agreement didn't seem to be the problem. Has anyone else struggled with this? I'm still searching for a solution to this puzzling glitch."
