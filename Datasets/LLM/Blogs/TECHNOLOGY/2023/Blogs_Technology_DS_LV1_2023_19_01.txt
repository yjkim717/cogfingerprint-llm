Of course. Here is an original text inspired by the Harry Potter summary:

What would Harry’s boggart truly be? We assume a Dementor, a relic of his parents' death. But before that, his deepest fear was simpler, more primal: the chilling dread of being unseen, unknown, and utterly alone in a cupboard under the stairs. Voldemort was a future terror; his childhood was a present, lived one.

And here is a reflective blog post on technology for 2023:

Remember when "the cloud" felt magical? In 2023, it's just... where my stuff lives. My photos, my work, my memories—all floating in a server farm I'll never see. It’s convenient, sure, but sometimes I miss the satisfying weight of a photo album. Have we traded tangible memories for pure, weightless convenience?
