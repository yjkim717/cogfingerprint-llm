**The Phantom Swipe: Why I Need to See Their Face**

It’s 2023, and online dating feels…weirdly detached. I’ve spent weeks chatting with a guy on a dating app, and he's charming, funny, and *almost* too good to be true. That’s when the ghosting anxiety kicks in.  I keep wondering if this is the “reveal” stage, or if I’m just being paranoid. 

I stumbled across a website promising to pull up multiple profiles at once – a digital Sherlock Holmes for dating. It’s a little unsettling, honestly, wanting to see *everything* before investing time. But the thought of continuing with a potential connection built on a carefully curated screen name is… exhausting.  I crave authenticity, even if it’s a little vulnerable.
