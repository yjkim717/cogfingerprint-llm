### My AI Tutor and the Ghost of Calculus Past

It was late 2023, and I’d hit a wall. I was determined to build a simple linear regression model from scratch, to truly *understand* it, not just import a library. The theory made sense until I had to minimize the cost function. My screen filled with sigmas and thetas, and my mind went blank. The chain rule and partial derivatives—concepts I’d confidently aced in college—had become ghostly, half-remembered formulas.

Frustrated, I did what any modern learner would do: I opened a chat with a powerful new AI. "Explain the partial derivative of the linear regression cost function with respect to theta-one, step-by-step," I typed, feeling a bit like I was cheating.

What happened next wasn't magic; it was a conversation. The AI didn’t just spit out the final, polished equation. It walked me through it, breaking down the power rule for `(h(x) - y)^2` and then patiently applying the chain rule. It was the infinitely patient tutor I never had, available at midnight on a Tuesday.

This experience was a profound reminder. The real power of this new wave of technology isn't just in automating tasks, but in democratizing understanding. It’s a tool that meets you where you are, whether you're a seasoned data scientist or someone like me, wrestling with the ghosts of calculus past. It didn't do the work for me, but it handed me the flashlight so I could find my own way out of the dark. And in the end, the "aha!" moment was still, wonderfully, all my own.
