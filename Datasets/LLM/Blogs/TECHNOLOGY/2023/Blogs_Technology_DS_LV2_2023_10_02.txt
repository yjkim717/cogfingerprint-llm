You know, I used to think the "30% rule" for housing was gospel—until I tried applying it to my own life last year. It felt like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. That’s when I realized something: we do the same thing with technology.

We’re told to adopt every new app or gadget, chasing that 100% digital efficiency. But what about our mental bandwidth? My breaking point was a week where my phone buzzed with 12 different project management tools. I was "connected," yet completely disconnected from my actual work.

Now, I measure tech not by its features, but by the quiet space it leaves in my day. Sometimes, the most productive tool is the one you don’t use.
