**The Day Firefox Saved My Downloads (and Maybe My Sanity)**

Okay, real talk – tech support calls are *not* my favorite. This week, a colleague was having a total nightmare with downloads in Chrome, and it spiraled into a frustrating afternoon.  Switching to Firefox felt like a tiny, desperate act of hope.  And you know what? It worked! Turns out a simple security configuration tweak was the culprit. 

It’s funny how these little discoveries happen – a reminder that sometimes the solution isn’t a fancy update, but a forgotten setting.  It just goes to show, even when things feel stuck, a fresh perspective can make all the difference.  Anyone else have a “aha!” tech moment recently?
