>## The Algorithm Knows I Like Bards (and Maybe a Little Chaos)

It's funny, isn't it, how technology learns us? I was just down a rabbit hole watching Critical Role – specifically episode 109 – where Sam Riegel masterfully pranked Scanlan. The whole thing was brilliantly silly, fueled by improv and a shared history between the cast. 

And then I realized… my YouTube recommendations are *saturated* with Critical Role. Like, aggressively so. It’s almost as if the algorithm noticed a single watch and thought, "Aha! This person appreciates witty banter and fantasy shenanigans!" 

It's a bit unsettling, this level of personalization. But also… kind of cool? It’s like having a digital friend who *gets* your sense of humor. Maybe the future isn't a dystopian nightmare, but a series of perfectly curated, slightly chaotic recommendations. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a bard to watch.
