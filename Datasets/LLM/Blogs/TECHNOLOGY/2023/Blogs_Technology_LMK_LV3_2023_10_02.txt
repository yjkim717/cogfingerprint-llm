As we navigate the digital landscape in 2023, a pressing question arises: how much should we really be spending on our digital subscriptions? The conventional wisdom of a one-size-fits-all budget percentage no longer seems to fit. Instead, a more nuanced approach is needed, one that considers our individual net income and the value we derive from our digital expenses. By taking a personalized look at our streaming services, software subscriptions, and online tools, we can create a more thoughtful and effective tech budget that aligns with our unique needs and priorities.
