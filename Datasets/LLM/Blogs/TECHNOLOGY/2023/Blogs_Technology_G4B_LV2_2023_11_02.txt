**The Algorithm and the Echo**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we get lost in the endless scroll? I’ve been wrestling with this lately, especially after reading about someone battling schizophrenia and the relentless pressure of self-employment. It made me think about how technology, designed to connect us, can sometimes feel incredibly isolating. 

I spend hours online, building my little corner of the internet, chasing engagement – a digital validation that feels… fragile.  There’s a constant hum of comparison, an algorithm feeding me what it *thinks* I want to see, reinforcing existing thoughts. 

It’s a stark reminder that even with all this “connection,” we can still feel profoundly alone, especially when facing challenges.  Like that self-employed person, I sometimes wonder if I’m chasing a phantom, a perfect online persona, while the real struggle – and the quiet need for genuine support – gets lost in the echo of the screen.  What about you? Are you finding it hard to disconnect?
