## The Algorithm Doesn't Care About My Brain Fog

It's 2023, and I'm staring at a blinking cursor, trying to hustle. Trying to freelance. Trying to *exist* financially while navigating schizophrenia. You know, the usual.

I often see anti-capitalist takes online, and honestly, they sting a little. Like, I *get* the critiques. The system *is* flawed. But when I'm battling a particularly rough patch of brain fog, when the simplest task feels monumental, it's hard to join the revolution. It’s hard to even remember to pay the bills.

There's a weird irony in railing against algorithms while simultaneously relying on them to find work. I'm chasing freelance gigs on platforms powered by the very systems people are criticizing. It’s a constant balancing act, a precarious dance between needing to survive and feeling complicit. 

Sometimes, I just wish the algorithm could recognize the extra processing power my brain *isn’t* using today, and maybe, just maybe, cut me a little slack.



Hopefully, this captures the essence of the prompt! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
