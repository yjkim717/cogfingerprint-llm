Input: A discussion on Reddit explores Takahashi's original plans for the Xenosaga series, specifically regarding the intended episode structure and how the final release differed from his vision.
Output: Remember Xenosaga? As a huge fan, I’ve been diving into old Reddit threads about Takahashi’s original plans for the series. It’s fascinating how the fragmented “episode” structure he envisioned – a sprawling, evolving narrative – was ultimately condensed. It makes you think about how much creative intent gets lost in the rush of game development, and how a truly ambitious vision can sometimes feel… compromised.
