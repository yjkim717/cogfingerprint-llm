**Zoom Fatigue & Digital Safety: Is ‘Safe Space’ Really Safe?**

It’s weird, right? I signed up for a Zoom event specifically for people with disabilities – touted as a ‘safe space.’  I was really hoping for connection, a place to just *be*. But honestly, it felt…performative.  

I’ve been burned before by online communities promising inclusivity, and this felt similar. The chat was full of platitudes, and the moderator seemed more focused on maintaining a certain vibe than genuinely listening.  It got me thinking about the limitations of digital spaces. Can a screen *really* offer a safe haven?  

Maybe we need to demand more from these virtual gatherings – not just pretty banners and hashtags, but real, thoughtful engagement.  I’m feeling a serious dose of Zoom fatigue, and a little bit of disillusionment.
