## That First Internship Feeling (and a Whole Lot of Python)

It's officially internship season, and I'm feeling that familiar mix of excitement and *slightly* terrified. As a CS freshman, the startup world feels both incredibly appealing and a little daunting. I've been brushing up on my Python – seriously, who *doesn't* love Python these days? – and dusting off my Java skills too. 

The biggest thing? Remembering that everyone starts somewhere.  Even the engineers I admire built their experience step-by-step.  So, fingers crossed, and wish me luck in the search!  Anyone else hunting for a summer gig? Let’s share tips!
