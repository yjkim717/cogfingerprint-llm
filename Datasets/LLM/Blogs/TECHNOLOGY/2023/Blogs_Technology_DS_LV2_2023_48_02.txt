Another week of job hunting, and I’m reminded how much our tools shape our identity in tech. I keep seeing roles demanding TypeScript, and I’ll admit—it’s just not my happy place. I miss the fluid freedom of plain JavaScript, where creativity wasn’t boxed in by strict types.

My mind wanders to backend choices, too. Is the Rails magic still alive, or is Python’s pragmatism the new king? And every Vue team posting feels like a small, welcoming tribe in a React-dominated world. It’s not just about skills; it’s about finding a culture where your coding soul fits. In 2023, the right tech stack feels as personal as the right neighborhood.
