**The Ghost Charge & the Digital Wall**

Okay, so this week’s been… frustrating. I was finally upgrading my phone with Straight Talk, using their Smart Pay option – seemed easy enough. Then, bam! A full-price charge appeared, and when I tried to cancel, I hit a brick wall. Seriously, they just wouldn’t budge. It’s a weird feeling, isn’t it? Relying so heavily on these digital systems, trusting that everything will just *work*. 

It made me think about how easily we can get trapped.  We swipe, we click, we assume. But what happens when the tech fails us?  It’s a stark reminder that behind the convenience of “smart pay” and instant ordering, there’s still a human – and often a frustratingly inflexible – process.  Anyone else had a similar experience lately?
