As I weigh my options for a graduate degree in tech, Cornell Tech's CS ME program is high on my list - but the cost is steep. In 2023, investing in my education is a big decision, and I'm exploring every avenue to make it feasible. I'm eyeing a full scholarship to offset the expenses. My goal is to gain expertise and boost my career prospects, potentially leading to an H1B visa. I'm hoping that the program's reputation and my own dedication will make me a competitive candidate for a full ride. Fingers crossed!
