The glow of my laptop screen feels like a cruel joke some days. Here I am, trying to build a freelance coding career from my apartment—a small act of rebellion against the corporate machine I’ve come to resent. My anti-capitalist ideals whisper that my worth isn’t tied to my productivity, yet my bank account screams otherwise.

Every invoice sent is a tightrope walk between survival and selling out. The pressure is a constant hum, a background process that often triggers my schizophrenia, making it hard to distinguish between a genuine software bug and a paranoid thought.

But in 2023, this screen is also my lifeline. It connects me to clients who value my work and a community that gets it. This digital independence is messy and fraught with tension, but it’s mine. It’s the fragile, complicated freedom of trying to build a life on my own terms, one line of code at a time.
