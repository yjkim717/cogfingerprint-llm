"The Perils of Taking Advice: A Cautionary Tale for Language Designers"

As I sat through the latest programming language conference in 2023, I couldn't help but feel a sense of déjà vu. Seasoned language designers were sharing their hard-earned wisdom with newcomers, offering advice on how to build the next big thing. While their intentions were good, I couldn't shake off the feeling that some of this advice was being taken as gospel. Language design is a nuanced art, and what works for one language or context may not work for another. I've seen well-meaning advice lead to more harm than good, stifling innovation and creativity. As language designers, we must be cautious when taking advice from others. We must consider our unique context and needs, rather than blindly following someone else's playbook. By doing so, we can create languages that truly shine in their own right.
