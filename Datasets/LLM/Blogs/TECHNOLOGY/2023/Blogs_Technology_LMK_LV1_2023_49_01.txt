As I reflect on my recent trip to Colombia, I'm reminded of the complexities of navigating visa requirements as a US citizen in 2023. With the rise of remote work and digital nomadism, staying connected on-the-go has become the norm. However, the rules surrounding tourist stays can be murky. I found myself wondering, "Can I simply leave and re-enter Colombia to extend my 90-day stay?" After a 2-day trip to a neighboring country, I returned, hoping to reset the clock. But, I was anxious about the possibility of being denied re-entry. As someone who's always connected through technology, it's jarring to be faced with the uncertainty of being "disconnected" from a country due to visa issues. Fortunately, my re-entry was smooth, but the experience left me pondering the intersection of technology, travel, and bureaucracy. How can we leverage tech to simplify visa processes and make international travel more seamless?
