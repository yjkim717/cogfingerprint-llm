### My 5,000 Hours Betrayed Me

For a decade, my hands knew what to do. Five thousand hours in CS:GO had wired my muscle memory like a second nervous system. A flick of the wrist, a controlled spray—it was an unspoken conversation between me and the game. It was my digital craft.

Then CS2 arrived in 2023 with its new "sub-tick" system, promising a more precise future. For me, it felt like the opposite.

Suddenly, my flicks, once a point of pride, feel like a coin toss. I see the enemy, my body reacts with a decade of ingrained instinct, but the result is a gamble. The spray patterns I could trace in my sleep now stutter and dance unpredictably. It’s like picking up a trusted guitar only to find the strings have been randomly retuned.

I’m not just fighting opponents anymore; I’m fighting my own muscle memory. That hard-earned confidence has been replaced by a hesitant second-guessing. Did I miss, or did the game not quite register my intent?

It’s a strange, humbling feeling when the technology you’ve mastered evolves and, for a moment, makes you feel like a beginner again. I know it’s progress, but right now, it just feels like my 5,000-hour-old friend has forgotten our handshake. The only way forward is to unlearn and rebuild, one uncertain click at a time.
