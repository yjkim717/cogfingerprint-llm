Of course, here is a reflective blog post about technology from 2023.

### The Ghost in My Machine

It started subtly. My phone, once a seamless extension of my thoughts, began to feel like a lead weight. My laptop’s endless tabs weren’t doors to opportunity, but a cacophony of half-finished ideas. I was constantly connected, yet I felt a strange, new kind of brain fog—a digital malaise.

Every notification was a tiny medical test for my attention, and I was failing them all. I’d open an app, scroll mindlessly, close it, and reopen it thirty seconds later, caught in a loop I didn’t design. I wasn’t just distracted; I felt a genuine health anxiety about my own ability to focus. Was my mind breaking?

The turning point was realizing the problem wasn't my willpower, but the design. These platforms are engineered to hijack our dopamine loops. So, I started a digital triage: turning off most notifications, using website blockers, and reclaiming my mornings.

The silence was unnerving at first, but then the fog lifted. The ghost wasn’t in my machine; it was the machine itself. And in 2023, choosing to be a little less connected is the ultimate act of self-care.
