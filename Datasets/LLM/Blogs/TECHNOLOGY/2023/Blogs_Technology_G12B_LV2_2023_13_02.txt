## The Unexpected Joy of WeChat Tutoring

Remember when "remote learning" felt like a frantic scramble? This year, I stumbled upon a surprisingly elegant solution: WeChat. I’m tutoring a student remotely, and the combination of video chat, screen sharing, and even live document editing within the app is… magical. Seeing their eyes light up as we collaboratively work through a problem? That's a connection no pre-recorded lesson could ever replicate. It’s a small thing, but it’s made a big difference.
