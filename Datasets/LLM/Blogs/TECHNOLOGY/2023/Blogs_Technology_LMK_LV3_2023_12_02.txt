As I dive into Elixir development in 2023, I'm struck by the pipe operator's versatility. While it's intuitive for commutative functions, non-commutative ones can be tricky. I've found that using an unconventional notation with the pipe operator can simplify handling these functions. By embracing this idiomatic code, I've written more readable and maintainable functional programming logic. It's a small tweak that has significantly improved my coding workflow, allowing me to focus on the logic rather than the syntax. This subtle shift has been a game-changer for me.
