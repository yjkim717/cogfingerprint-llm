It’s 2023, and I’m a software engineer who needs quiet to focus—not a luxury, but a necessity. My brain processes sound differently, and open offices? They’re minefields of distraction.

So, I requested noise-cancelling headphones as a simple accommodation. You’d think it’d be straightforward, right? Instead, I found myself justifying my need repeatedly, navigating layers of bureaucracy just to do my job effectively.

It’s ironic—we build tools for accessibility every day, yet when it comes to our own teams, we stumble. Those headphones aren’t just gadgets; they’re my gateway to contributing fully, without draining mental energy filtering out chatter.

This experience taught me that true innovation isn’t just in the code we write, but in fostering environments where everyone has what they need to thrive. Sometimes, the smallest tools make the biggest impact.
