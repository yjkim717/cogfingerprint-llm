## Dreaming of a Better C (and What That Means for Everything Else)

Lately, I’ve been down a rabbit hole thinking about C. Not *using* C, mind you, but *imagining* C if it were born today. It's a bit of a thought experiment, really. What if we tossed aside decades of legacy and just designed a language from scratch, borrowing the best bits of C but fixing the rest?

The idea popped up while wrestling with some Go code – its slices are just *so* elegant compared to C's pointer arithmetic. And namespacing! Oh, the joy of avoiding naming collisions. Even a simple thing like deferred function calls (like Go's `defer`) would drastically improve code clarity.

It’s more than just a whim. Thinking about what a "perfected" C might look like highlights the strengths *and* weaknesses of so many languages we use daily. It’s a reminder that even the giants of programming have room for evolution, and that dreaming about the "what ifs" can illuminate the path forward. Maybe one day, someone *will* build it.
