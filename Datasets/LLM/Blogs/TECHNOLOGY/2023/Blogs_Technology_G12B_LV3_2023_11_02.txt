## The Algorithm Can't See My Struggle (and Maybe That's Okay)

It’s 2023, and we’re all supposed to be hustling, right? Building our brands, monetizing our passions, leveraging the power of algorithms. As a self-employed creative with schizophrenia, that narrative feels…complicated. 

I’ve seen the anti-capitalist critiques online, and honestly, sometimes they sting. It's hard to argue with the systemic issues when you're staring down the barrel of another late bill. The pressure to *produce* – to consistently churn out content for the ever-demanding digital beast – clashes violently with the reality of managing my mental health. 

Some days, just getting out of bed feels like a monumental victory, let alone crafting the perfect Instagram caption or optimizing a blog post for SEO. There's a guilt that creeps in, a feeling of failing both myself and the perceived ideals of self-employment.

But lately, I'm starting to question the relentless pursuit of online validation. Maybe the algorithm *can't* see the invisible battles I fight. And maybe, just maybe, that's a tiny bit freeing. Focusing on survival, on *being*, feels more important than chasing likes and revenue right now.
