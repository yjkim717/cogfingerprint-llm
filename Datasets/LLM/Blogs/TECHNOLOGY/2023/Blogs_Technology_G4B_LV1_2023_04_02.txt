**Is Buying in London Really Worth It Anymore? (And My Tech-Fueled Doubt)**

Okay, let’s be honest. Scrolling through property listings in London lately feels…daunting. I was just staring at a ridiculously priced flat the other day, and it hit me: is anyone *actually* buying here anymore? It felt like a giant, expensive question mark. 

The numbers are terrifying, right? Massive deposits – like, a crippling chunk of your savings – then the mortgage repayments that seem to multiply overnight. And don't even get me started on service charges on leasehold properties. It’s a whole other layer of hidden costs. 

I’ve been spending way too much time on Zillow and Rightmove, using those ridiculous ‘rent vs buy’ calculators. They always scream ‘buy!’ but I’m starting to think they’re just programmed to sell. 

Ironically, I’ve been trying to find a solution through tech. I’ve been experimenting with budgeting apps, trying to track every penny, and even looking into automated investment platforms to build a bigger deposit. But it feels like a constant uphill battle. 

Honestly, I’m starting to lean towards renting a little longer. Maybe I’ll just invest that ‘deposit’ money in something a little more…stable.  It's a weird feeling, isn’t it?  Feeling like the tools we *should* be using to help us are actually making a major life decision feel even more complex.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
