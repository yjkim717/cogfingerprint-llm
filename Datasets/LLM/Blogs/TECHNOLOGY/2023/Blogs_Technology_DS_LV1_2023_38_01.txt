As a longtime R user, I’ve watched the generative AI wave with fascination—and a bit of FOMO. When PandasAI hit the scene in 2023, letting Python users chat with their dataframes, I couldn’t help but wonder: where’s our R equivalent? We’ve got powerful dataframes and robust statistical tests, but that conversational layer? Still a gap. It’s a reminder that innovation isn’t just about raw power—it’s about accessibility. Maybe it’s time for the R community to dream bigger and build bridges, not just better models.
