As I planned our Yukon canoe trip for June 2023, I couldn't help but think about how technology has changed the way we adventure. Gone are the days of dusty guidebooks and phone calls to outfitters. Now, a few clicks can secure canoe rentals with Whitehorse outfitters and map out our route. It's amazing, yet sometimes I miss the thrill of discovery that came with less connectivity. Still, I'm excited to paddle through the Yukon's breathtaking wilderness with my family.
