## The Ghosts of Builds Past

It's funny what pops up when you're decluttering. I stumbled across an old computer combo – an Intel i7-6700, a tiny ASRock mini-itx motherboard, and some DDR3 memory. Remember DDR3? Feels like a lifetime ago! I listed it online for a steal, just $128.

It got me thinking about all the projects built with those components. So many late nights, tinkering, and the thrill of seeing a machine come to life. Tech moves *fast*, doesn’t it? It’s a little bittersweet, letting go of a piece of that history, but also exciting to see what innovation’s around the corner.
