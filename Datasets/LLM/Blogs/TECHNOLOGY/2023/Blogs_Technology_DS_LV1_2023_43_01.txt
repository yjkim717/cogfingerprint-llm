Last year, I spent weeks on a system design doc, only to realize my diagrams were just the beginning. The real challenge was capturing the dynamic interactions and trade-offs that diagrams alone couldn’t convey. Now, I focus on weaving in clear narratives and real-world scenarios, making the architecture feel alive. It’s not about perfect visuals—it’s about building a shared understanding that guides the team through complexity.
