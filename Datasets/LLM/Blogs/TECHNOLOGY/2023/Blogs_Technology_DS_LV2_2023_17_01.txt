### The Quiet Ritual of the Backup

There’s a certain, almost meditative ritual to my Thursday nights. It’s not yoga or a fancy skincare routine; it’s the gentle hum of my homelab and the soft glow of USB drive lights blinking in the dark. This is my backup hour.

For months, my system for Restic backups was… let’s call it ‘artisanal.’ I’d manually plug in one of three USB drives, cross my fingers, and hope it mounted correctly. Sometimes it did. Other times, I’d be knee-deep in terminal commands, wrestling with `fstab` entries, feeling less like a tech wizard and more like a digital janitor. The anxiety of accidentally pulling the wrong drive and corrupting my precious data was real.

Then it hit me. I was treating my data like a fragile artifact in a museum, when I should be building a resilient, automated library. The goal wasn't just to *have* backups, but to have a system that respected my time and my sanity.

So, I’m embarking on a new project: scripting the solution. A small script to safely handle the mounting and unmounting, to make the drive-swapping process as mindless as brushing my teeth. Because in 2023, with AI writing sonnets and cars driving themselves, the ultimate luxury isn't more processing power—it's a little bit of peace of mind, automated.
