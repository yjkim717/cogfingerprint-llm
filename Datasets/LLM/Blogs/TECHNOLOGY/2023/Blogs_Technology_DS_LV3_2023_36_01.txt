The rumble of my old Citroën diesel has been the soundtrack to my life here in the province for over a decade. It’s hauled firewood and carried memories. But in 2023, that familiar sound feels like a relic.

My dilemma with the new C5 Aircross feels bigger than just motorisation; it’s a question of identity. Do I cling to the dependable torque of diesel for my annual remorque run, a ritual that warms my home and soul? Or do I finally embrace the quiet hum of a hybrid, stepping into a future that’s already here? It’s not just about choosing a car. It’s about navigating the changing landscape of my own life, one where tradition and technology are pulling me in different directions.
