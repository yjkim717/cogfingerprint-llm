"Unplugged and Unemployed: The Digital Detox of a 'Parked' Civil Servant"

As I sit in front of my computer, staring blankly at the screen, I'm reminded of the countless hours I've spent "working" without actually doing any real work. It's been over a year since I was last assigned a task or a project at the EPST, the public institution where I've been employed as a civil servant for over two decades. My colleagues and I call it being "in limbo" or "parked" - a euphemism for being paid to do nothing.

In 2023, where technology is supposed to make our lives easier and more efficient, I find myself in a strange kind of digital purgatory. My computer is on, my email is open, but my mind is numb. I'm not alone; several of my colleagues have been in similar situations, some even taking their cases to the administrative tribunal, claiming moral harassment due to being blacklisted and left without meaningful work.

As I reflect on my situation, I wonder if this is a form of digital-age bullying. Is it harassment to be deliberately kept in a state of limbo, with no clear end in sight? The French fonction publique is supposed to be a bastion of job security, but for some of us, it's become a limbo of uncertainty.

I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm starting to see this as an opportunity to unplug and reboot. Maybe being "parked" is a chance to rediscover what I love about my job, or to explore new passions. Who knows? Maybe I'll emerge from this digital detox with a fresh perspective and a newfound appreciation for the world beyond my screen.
