There I was, staring at my VMware Horizon View Console, utterly stumped. For days, I couldn't download the remote assistance files I desperately neededâ€”Chrome and Edge kept blocking them. It was 2023, and browser security was tighter than ever. After tweaking Chrome's settings, I got a temporary fix, but it felt like a band-aid. On a whim, I tried Firefox, and just like that, it worked seamlessly. Sometimes, the simplest switch is the most effective solution, a small reminder that tech roadblocks often have surprisingly straightforward fixes.
