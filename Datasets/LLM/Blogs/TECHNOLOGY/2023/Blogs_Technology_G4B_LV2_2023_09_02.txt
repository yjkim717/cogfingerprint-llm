**The Grind vs. the Glory**

Remember obsessing over Fortnite FNCS? I do. Watching Mongraal and Khanada pull off those insane Grand Slams felt… monumental. But lately, I’ve been thinking about a different kind of consistency.

It feels more sustainable, more *me*. 2023 is teaching me that lesson, one build order at a time.
