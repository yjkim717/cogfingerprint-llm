### The Inflammation in My Digital Life

It started subtly, like a faint, persistent hum. My laptop—my trusty companion for work, creativity, and late-night scrolling—began to slow down. Apps I relied on, my digital "omeprazole," could no longer quell the lag. My browser tabs multiplied like a "hiatal hernia," creating a chaotic backlog that choked my device's processing power.

I was juggling deadlines and family life, and this constant digital "LPR"—a low-grade reflux of notifications, updates, and spinning beach balls—was eroding my patience. I’d apply a quick "Gaviscon Advance" in the form of a restart, but the relief was temporary. The core inflammation was still there: digital clutter.

In 2023, I finally had to admit my system was overloaded. I decluttered my desktop, unsubscribed from relentless newsletters, and instituted a strict "close the tab" policy. It wasn't a magic cure, but a lifestyle adjustment for my tech. The hum is gone now, replaced by the quiet whir of a machine—and a mind—finally able to breathe. It’s a constant management, but the peace is worth the vigilance.
