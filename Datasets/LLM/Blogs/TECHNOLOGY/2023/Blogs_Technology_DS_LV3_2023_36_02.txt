### The Digital Freeze-Out: When Your Career Goes Ghost

It’s a strange kind of professional purgatory. In 2023, we’re all so connected, yet I’ve never felt more professionally invisible. My story starts with a simple, courageous act: I reported a case of digital harassment. It wasn’t just a nasty comment; it was a coordinated campaign of subtle, demeaning messages and exclusion from key project channels by a senior colleague. I spoke up, believing the system would work.

Instead of a resolution, I was given the corporate equivalent of a silent treatment. My access to the main project management platform was quietly revoked. My login for the team’s shared drive still worked, but the folders were empty—a digital ghost town. I was still on the payroll, a name in the system, but my assigned tasks vanished. For a year, my only "work" was watching my own skills atrophy.

I’d open my laptop each morning to a silent Slack channel and a barren Asana board. The paycheck hitting my account every month felt less like a comfort and more like hush money. The constant, gnawing suspicion began: had I been digitally blacklisted? Was my employee profile tagged with some invisible flag that ensured my application for any internal, **vacant position** was automatically filtered out by an algorithm? The system designed for efficiency had become my prison.

The isolation was crushing. The lack of purpose, the feeling of being erased from the professional world while still technically being in it, led me down a dark path. I slipped into a **depression** that no productivity hack could fix. My phone, once a source of connection, became a trigger for anxiety—a constant reminder of the career that had flatlined.

This isn’t just a story about workplace **harassment**; it’s about the new, insidious forms it can take in our digital-first world. It’s about how systems meant to protect can be weaponized to silence, leaving you paid, present, but utterly powerless. The most damaging toxicity isn’t always loud; sometimes, it’s the deafening silence of a career put on permanent mute.
