As I set up my home audio system in 2023, I realized that an active subwoofer with a built-in amplifier was the missing piece I needed. By powering multiple speakers directly, it eliminated the need for a separate AV receiver, simplifying my setup. This streamlined solution not only reduced clutter but also enhanced my surround sound experience, bringing a more immersive audio experience to my living room.
