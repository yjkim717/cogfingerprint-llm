## The Blue Light and the Big Questions

It's funny, isn't it? We live in an age where I can video call my best friend across the globe, instantly access any information imaginable, and order dinner with a few taps on my phone. Technology has solved so many practical problems, made life undeniably *easier*. Yet, lately, I’ve been feeling… a little overwhelmed.

Maybe it's the constant connectivity. Maybe it’s the curated perfection of social media. Or maybe, it's just that staring at a screen for hours a day has started to amplify the quieter anxieties that already lived inside me. 

I've been thinking a lot about time lately. About how quickly it’s slipping by, about the things I want to do, and the things I’m putting off. It's a feeling that’s been bubbling under the surface, but it feels particularly potent this year. I'm 23, which feels both incredibly young and shockingly fleeting all at once. 

There’s a weird paradox in this digital age: we're more connected than ever, yet I sometimes feel profoundly alone with these big, existential questions. The endless scroll can become a distraction, a way to avoid confronting those feelings of uncertainty, of mortality. 

I'm trying to find a balance. To appreciate the incredible tools we have, while also carving out space for quiet reflection, for truly *being* present, away from the blue light and the constant hum of notifications. It’s a work in progress, to say the least.
