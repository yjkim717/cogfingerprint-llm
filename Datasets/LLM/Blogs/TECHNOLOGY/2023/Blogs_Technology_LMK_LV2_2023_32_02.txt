"Building a Redundant Network: A Journey to Uninterrupted Data Flow"

As I sat in front of my home lab setup, sipping my morning coffee, I realized that my network infrastructure was a tangled mess. I was running multiple NAS/SAN devices and hypervisors, but my network configuration was anything but robust. A single switch failure could bring my entire operation to a grinding halt. It was time to upgrade to a fully redundant network configuration. But, I was faced with a daunting task: finding an affordable and easy-to-manage switch that could handle the demands of my setup. As I navigated the complex world of switch platforms, I discovered that it's not just about throwing money at the problem. It's about designing a network that can adapt to my needs, not the other way around. In this blog post, I'll share my journey to building a redundant network that's both reliable and scalable.
