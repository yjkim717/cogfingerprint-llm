"Lessons from the Trenches: A Cautionary Tale for Language Designers"

As I navigated the vast landscape of programming languages in 2023, I couldn't help but notice the eagerness with which language designers seek advice from their peers. While it's natural to want to learn from others' experiences, I've come to realize that this advice can sometimes be a double-edged sword. What works for one language may not work for another, and blindly following someone else's design decisions can lead to missteps.

I've seen it happen time and again - a language designer adopts a feature or paradigm because it's deemed "best practice" by another community, only to find that it clashes with their own language's unique goals and philosophies. As someone who's worked on compiler construction, I can attest that the nuances of language design are far more complex than they initially seem. So, to my fellow language designers, I'd say: take advice with a grain of salt, and always consider whether it aligns with your language's distinct vision.
