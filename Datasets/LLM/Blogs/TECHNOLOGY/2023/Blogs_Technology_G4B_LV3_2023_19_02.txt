**The Unexpected Joy of Digital Silliness**

Remember that feeling when a perfectly timed, ridiculous moment just *happens* in a game? Lately, I’ve been noticing how much I crave that spontaneous joy online. It’s easy to get bogged down in productivity and polished content, but scrolling through Discord and seeing friends spontaneously roleplaying – embracing the absurd with characters like Scanlan – is a beautiful reminder.  It’s a critical role for us all, I think, to inject a little playful chaos into our digital lives.  Sometimes, just letting go and being silly is the best upgrade.
