### A Semester of Digital Whiplash (And What I Actually Learned)

Well, that semester was something else. I went in thinking I’d master cloud architecture and come out a coding wizard. Instead, I got a brutal but invaluable lesson in something far more critical: my own limits.

The sheer pace of new frameworks and updates in 2023 is dizzying. I’d no sooner grasp one concept than two more would pop up. The pressure was immense, and failing a midterm for a language I’d just started learning felt like a personal failure. This post is my little sigh of relief—my digital exhale. I passed most of my courses, but the real victory wasn't the grade.

The true learning was in the struggle itself. I learned to ask for help in developer forums, to embrace the "beginner's mind," and that sometimes, stepping away from the screen is the most productive step you can take. The tech will keep evolving, but this semester taught me how to evolve with it, not just chase it. And for that, I'm weirdly grateful.
