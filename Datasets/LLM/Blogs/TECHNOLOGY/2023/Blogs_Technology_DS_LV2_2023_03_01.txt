Of course, here is a reflective blog post on technology, written in a conversational and storytelling style.

### The Ghost in My Machine: A 2023 Wake-Up Call

It hit me last Tuesday, around 2:37 PM. I was sitting in a café, my phone face-up on the table, buzzing with a notification. My hand twitched, my eyes darted down, and I felt a genuine, Pavlovian spike of anxiety. It wasn't a work email or a dire news alert. It was a push notification from a food delivery app, reminding me that my favourite ramen place had a new seasonal broth.

In that moment, I didn't see a phone. I saw a leash.

We’re now deep into 2023, and the conversation around tech has shifted. It’s no longer just about the wonder of having the world in our pockets; it’s about the weight of it. We spent years optimising our lives for convenience, for connection, for the endless scroll. We curated our preferences with meticulous care—this music, that show, this type of news, that brand of socks. The algorithms learned us, and we thought we were in control.

But somewhere along the line, the preferences started curating us.

My phone knows I like productivity podcasts, so it serves me more content on "hustle culture," which in turn makes me feel guilty for not side-hustling. My dating app learned I’m drawn to certain witty bios, so it now only shows me a very specific, algorithmically-approved type of person, creating a weirdly homogenous pool of potential partners. The technology, built to serve my choices, began to reinforce them into a rigid, inescapable box. It felt less like a tool and more like a toxic relationship—one where my partner kept telling me what I liked and who I was, shutting down any chance of spontaneous discovery.

My wake-up call wasn't to smash my devices and live in a cabin. It was about resetting the dynamic. I’ve started doing one thing differently: I’m intentionally introducing friction. I manually search for news instead of letting a feed decide. I put my phone in another room for an hour each evening, forcing myself to be bored, to think, to just *be*.

The goal isn't to reject technology, but to re-establish a relationship with it based on respect, not subservience. It’s about remembering that my preferences are a starting point for exploration, not a digital cage. The ghost in the machine is powerful, but it’s still my house. And in 2023, I’m finally taking back the keys.
