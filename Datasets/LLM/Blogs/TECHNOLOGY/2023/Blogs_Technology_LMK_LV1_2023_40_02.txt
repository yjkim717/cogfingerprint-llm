As I dove into customizing my window manager, bspwm, I found myself stumped by the syntax used in its man pages. The notation looked eerily familiar, yet I couldn't quite put my finger on it. It wasn't until I stumbled upon a mention of EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) that the pieces clicked into place. EBNF is a metalanguage used to define the grammar of programming languages, and it turns out that bspwm's syntax is rooted in this formal system.

I was fascinated by how a notation system designed to define the grammar of programming languages could be used to describe the configuration syntax of a window manager. It highlighted the beauty of consistency in technical design. As I delved deeper, I realized that understanding this syntax wasn't just about configuring bspwm; it was about appreciating the underlying structure that governs how we interact with our machines. In 2023, it's moments like these that remind me of the intricate web of technologies that shape our digital lives.
