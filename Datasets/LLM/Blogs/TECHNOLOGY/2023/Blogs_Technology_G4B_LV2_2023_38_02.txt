**The Email Question: Should I Really Reach Out?**

Okay, so I was just reading this really interesting piece about a neuroscience PhD student stressing over emailing professors before interviews. It got me thinking about this whole “connection” thing in the digital age. 

Seriously, in 2023, is it weird to proactively reach out to someone you admire? I still feel this little pang of anxiety about it – like, am I being too forward? But then I remember how isolating academia can be, and those small connections *do* matter. 

It’s tempting to just stick to the formal interview process, but a quick, genuine email expressing your research interests? It feels…human.  Maybe the student was right – a little pre-interview alignment could be a good thing. What are your thoughts?
