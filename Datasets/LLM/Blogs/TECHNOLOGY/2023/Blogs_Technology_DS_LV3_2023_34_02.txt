It was supposed to be our home on wheels, a promise of freedom in 2023. But that promise started to leak, literally. The first time we noticed a small drip from the main slide, we weren't too worried. The dealer fixed it under warranty, no problem. Then it happened again after a heavy rain. And again.

Each "slide repair" felt like a temporary patch, a digital band-aid on a growing analog problem. I started thinking about the long-term damage silently spreading behind the walls, a ghost in the machine. It’s more than an inconvenience; it’s a breach of trust.

Now, we're looking into our state's lemon law, wondering if our high-tech RV is fundamentally flawed. It’s a strange feeling when the technology meant to deliver adventure instead delivers a lesson in consumer rights and the haunting reality of water damage.
