It’s 2023, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how we budget for our digital lives. We’re quick to apply old financial rules of thumb to our mortgages, but what about our tech expenses? Between streaming services, cloud storage, and app subscriptions, my monthly "digital mortgage" was silently eating away at my net income. I realized I was treating these costs like fixed housing expenses, never questioning their true value. So, I did a personal finance audit. Canceling unused subscriptions felt like paying off a high-interest loan. Now, I only invest in tech that genuinely enriches my life. It’s a more mindful way to live—and my wallet thanks me for it.
