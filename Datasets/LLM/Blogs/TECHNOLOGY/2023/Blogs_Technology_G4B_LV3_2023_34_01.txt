**The Scroll and the Sizzle: Finding Calm in a Constant Flare**

Let’s be honest, 2023 feels like a relentless barrage of notifications, right? Between work emails, family updates on WhatsApp, and the endless scroll of Instagram, it’s easy to feel like you’re constantly battling *something*. For me, that “something” has been a frustratingly persistent case of GERD – a constant, low-level inflammation that flares up with surprising regularity. 

It’s a weird parallel, I know. Like trying to manage a digestive issue with the same level of vigilance I dedicate to keeping up with the digital world. I’ve tweaked my diet, taken my medication, but it feels like a constant cycle of trying to soothe the burn, only for it to return, often triggered by a late-night takeout order (a small indulgence, I tell you!). 

I’m learning that just like I need to disconnect to find calm, I need to manage my tech use to manage my symptoms.  It’s about recognizing those triggers – the stress of a busy schedule, the blue light before bed – and actively creating space for mindful moments.  It's a slow process, a constant recalibration, but maybe, just maybe, finding a little digital peace will help me find a little more digestive peace too.
