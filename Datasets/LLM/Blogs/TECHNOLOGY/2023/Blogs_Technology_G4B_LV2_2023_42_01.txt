**The Hinge Moment**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple hinge can suddenly shift your whole tech search. I’ve been wrestling with needing a new laptop, and I realized I wasn’t even considering the *feel* of it. I’ve been stuck on Chromebooks, but this time I'm open to other options like the Asus Vivobook or even a Chromebook Flex.  A sturdy hinge and a screen that isn’t just… blurry? It feels surprisingly important.  Anyone else feeling this particular tech dilemma in 2023?
