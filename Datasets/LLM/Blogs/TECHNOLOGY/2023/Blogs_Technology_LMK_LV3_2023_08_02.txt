"Embracing Support in a Digital Age"

As I navigated my corporate job with Asperger's, I was invited to an online disability support event hosted by my employer. My initial hesitation stemmed from concerns about the session being recorded. In 2023, it's understandable to feel uneasy about digital footprints. However, I soon realized that this safe space was designed to foster connection and understanding. By embracing this online event, I discovered a supportive community that understood my needs, making my work environment feel more inclusive and welcoming.
