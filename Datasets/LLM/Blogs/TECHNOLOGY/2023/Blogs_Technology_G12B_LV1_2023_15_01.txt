>## The Ghost of Perfect Sleep and the Algorithm of Comfort

It's a strange thing, how much we chase *perfect* these days. I've been on a quest for decent sleep lately, and it’s led me down a rabbit hole of smart home tech and, oddly, blackout curtains. 

Years ago, I had these custom curtains – thick, luxurious, total darkness. They were a revelation. I slept like a baby. Then, life happened, and they disappeared. Now, trying to replicate that feeling feels like battling an algorithm. I've bought "blackout" curtains that aren't quite, smart bulbs with "sunset simulation" modes that feel more jarring than soothing. 

It makes you wonder, doesn’t it? Are we really improving our lives with all this tech, or just chasing a ghost of a feeling? That perfect, undisturbed sleep I remember wasn't about fancy lights or automated routines. It was about a simple, tangible barrier against the outside world. Maybe sometimes, the best technology is the absence of it.
