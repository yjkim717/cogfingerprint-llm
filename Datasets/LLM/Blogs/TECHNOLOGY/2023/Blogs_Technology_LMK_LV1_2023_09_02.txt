As I sit here in 2023, surrounded by the latest gaming tech, I realize my true strength lies in consistency. I'm not talking about being a one-hit wonder in FNCS, but rather being a steady performer in grands. Players like Mongraal set the bar high, but I'd rather be a reliable top-10 finisher than a flash-in-the-pan winner. For me, it's about building a reputation as a consistent competitor in the Fortnite scene.
