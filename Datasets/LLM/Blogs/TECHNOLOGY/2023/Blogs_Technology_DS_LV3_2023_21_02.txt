It’s 2023, and I’ve spent more hours than I care to admit chasing that perfect in-game sound cue—the faint rustle of grass, the distant reload. For years, my bulky "gaming" headset felt like a necessary evil: booming bass that drowned out subtle audio, and a clamp force that left my glasses digging into my temples after an hour. I was missing the details, and my ears were paying the price.

That’s when I dove into the world of neutral, open-back headphones. Skeptical at first—could a "budget" pair under €150 really be a game-changer? The answer was a resounding yes. The first time I put them on, it was like wiping fog off a window. The soundstage was expansive and crisp, letting me pinpoint enemy movements with startling accuracy. And the comfort? I finally experienced what it meant to wear headphones for an entire evening without that familiar ache. It wasn't just an upgrade; it was a revelation in how I experience my games. Sometimes, the best gear isn't the flashiest—it's the one that simply gets out of the way and lets you play.
