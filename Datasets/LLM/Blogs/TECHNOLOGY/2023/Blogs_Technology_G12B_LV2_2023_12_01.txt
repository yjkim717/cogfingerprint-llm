## Validation Headaches & Elixir's Gentle Solution

Anyone else feel like half their development time lately is spent wrestling with validation? Seriously, building APIs with complex forms feels like a constant battle. I was just facing this in a current Elixir project, specifically with Ecto changesets.

It got me thinking â€“ are we overcomplicating things? I started exploring modularizing my changesets, breaking them down into smaller, reusable pieces. It's surprisingly satisfying! Suddenly, the validation logic isn't a monolithic beast, but a collection of manageable, testable functions. 

It's a small shift, but it's making a big difference in my workflow. Anyone else experimenting with this approach? I'd love to hear your thoughts!




Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
