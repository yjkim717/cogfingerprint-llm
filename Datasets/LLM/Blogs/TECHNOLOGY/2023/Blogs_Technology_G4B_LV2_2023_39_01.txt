**The Ghost of Smooth Gestures**

Anyone else feel a little…robbed lately? I recently discovered Smooth Gestures Plus – a Chrome extension that promised to revolutionize my tab management with intuitive mouse gestures. Seriously, it felt like having a tiny, personalized assistant for my browser. Then, poof! Gone from the Chrome Web Store. 

It’s a weird feeling, isn’t it? Like losing a small, quietly helpful tool. It reminds me that tech, while incredibly powerful, can also shift and change without much notice.  It’s a tiny frustration, but it highlighted how we rely on these little digital helpers to streamline our days.  Anyone else mourning a lost extension?
