"As I navigated the crowded alleys of my city in 2023, I couldn't help but think about how technology could ease the urban frustration caused by abandoned collection carts. Smart waste management systems, for instance, could optimize waste collection and encourage residents to store carts properly. It's a small innovation that could make a big difference in our daily lives and community issues, one that I'm excited to see unfold."
