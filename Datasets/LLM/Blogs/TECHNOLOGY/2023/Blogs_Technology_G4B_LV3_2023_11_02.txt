**The Algorithm and the Echo Chamber**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re supposedly more connected than ever, glued to our screens, yet sometimes I feel incredibly isolated. I’ve been thinking a lot about the way technology shapes our realities, especially when you layer in existing challenges like mental health. 

Recently, I was reading about a self-employed person with schizophrenia navigating a really tough financial situation. It struck a chord – the constant pressure of deadlines, the fear of failure, the feeling of being judged. And it made me consider how social media, with its relentless algorithms, can amplify those feelings. 

It’s so easy to get trapped in an echo chamber, surrounded by opinions that confirm our anxieties, especially when facing hardship.  The pursuit of “success” online often feels like a relentless race, and it can be exhausting to maintain that facade.  We need to be mindful of how these digital spaces impact our wellbeing and actively seek out diverse perspectives – just like that self-employed individual needs to find support beyond the critical voices.  What do you think?
