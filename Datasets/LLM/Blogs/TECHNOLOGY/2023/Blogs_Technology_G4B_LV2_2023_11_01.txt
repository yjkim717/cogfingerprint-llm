**Pixels, Pages, and a Little Bit of Worry**

It's funny, isn’t it? How easily we get caught up in the *doing* of things, and how often we forget to just… feel about them. I’ve been spending a lot of time lately wrestling with a project, a children’s book called ‘Tara Kinesis,’ and honestly, it’s been a strange mix of exhilaration and a low-hum of anxiety. 

You know that feeling when you pour a little piece of yourself into something? Like you’re not just building a story, but layering in a bit of your hopes, your worries, even your quirks? That’s exactly what’s happening with Tara. She’s a character born from late-night brainstorming sessions and a desperate need to create something beautiful for young minds. 

I’ve been dipping my toes into the world of avatar trading – a surprisingly complex hobby! – while working on the book. It feels a little absurd, doesn’t it? Spending hours perfecting a digital representation of a fantastical creature when I’m supposed to be crafting a narrative. But there’s a weird connection there, I think. Both involve a kind of creation, a shaping of something from nothing. 

It also made me think about the way we consume stories now. We’re drowning in them, right? Streaming services, podcasts, endless scrolling… it’s a constant barrage. And I’m fascinated by the shift towards digital, towards things like the free digital downloads I'm offering for 'Tara Kinesis'. It’s a small step, but it feels important to make the book accessible, to break down those barriers to entry. 

There’s a beautiful vulnerability in offering something freely, in trusting that people will appreciate it. But there's also a nagging worry, too. A worry that in this hyper-connected world, my little story will get lost in the noise. There's a delay looming, and that’s always a difficult feeling – a sense that something precious is taking a little longer to come to fruition. 

I’ve been reading a lot about schizophrenia lately, exploring how it can impact storytelling and perception. It’s a heavy topic, but it’s also incredibly insightful. It’s reminded me that stories aren’t just about happy endings or clear resolutions. They’re about exploring the messy, complicated, and often unsettling parts of the human experience. 

‘Tara Kinesis’ is, at its core, about finding your voice, about embracing the unexpected turns in life. And maybe, just maybe, sharing it in a way that resonates with someone out there. 

Right now, I’m just trying to hold onto that feeling – that initial spark of creativity – and trust that the pixels and pages will eventually come together.
