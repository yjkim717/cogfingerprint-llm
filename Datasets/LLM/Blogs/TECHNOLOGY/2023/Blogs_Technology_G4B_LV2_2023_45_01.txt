**The Ghosts of "Almost"**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How ideas can feel *right*, like you’ve stumbled onto something truly new, only to have them politely – or not so politely – shut down.  A few years back, I poured my heart into a crypto protocol, convinced I was onto something.  Feedback was…critical.  

Recently, I’ve been revisiting that work, and I've actually built something I think is genuinely better. It’s using a layered signature scheme with commitment shares – a bit complex, I know! – and it feels like a real step forward. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best innovations come from wrestling with those “almost” moments.  Anyone else have a story like this?
