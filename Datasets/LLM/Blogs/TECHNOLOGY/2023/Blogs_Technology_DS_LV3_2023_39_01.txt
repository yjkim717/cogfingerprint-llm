It’s 2023, and I still catch myself trying to flick my mouse to close a tab, only to remember my beloved Smooth Gestures Plus is gone. That little Chrome extension wasn’t just code; it was muscle memory. With a simple gesture, I could navigate, manage tabs, and feel like a browsing wizard. Now, I’m left clicking tiny X’s, my efficiency shattered. It’s funny how a tool you take for granted becomes part of your digital soul. I’m still searching for an alternative that feels like home.
