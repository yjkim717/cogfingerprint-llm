It’s 2023, and I’m sitting here, staring at my phone—the same one that just auto-suggested a reply before I’d even finished typing. It got me thinking: are we all just meta-gaming our own lives now? We anticipate, optimize, and react based on data, not instinct. It’s efficient, sure, but are we losing the raw, unscripted moments that make us human? Sometimes, I wonder if we’re scripting our stories instead of living them. Maybe it’s time to close the analytics tab and just… feel.
