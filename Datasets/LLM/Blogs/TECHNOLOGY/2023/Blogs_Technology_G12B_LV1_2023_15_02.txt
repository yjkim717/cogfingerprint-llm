>## The Ghosts in the Machine (and Why My Signs Won't Show Up)

Okay, so I'm officially baffled. I've been deep in this online game for weeks, meticulously crafting my in-game presence – the equivalent of digital homesteading, really. And lately, something weird is happening. I’ve been trying to place 'signs' - think little markers to communicate with other players – but they just… aren't.

I've checked everything. Double-checked the password protocols, followed every troubleshooting step the community forums suggest (even the "furled finger" technique – yes, that’s a thing!). It's frustrating. It feels like the game is ignoring me, like I’m shouting into a digital void. 

It's a silly thing to get hung up on, but it's making me think about how reliant we are on these systems, and how easily they can feel opaque, arbitrary, even *ghostly* when they malfunction. Anyone else experiencing weird tech glitches lately?
