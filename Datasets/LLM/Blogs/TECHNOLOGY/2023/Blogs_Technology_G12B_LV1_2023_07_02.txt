## The Unexpected Lesson from Facebook Ads

Something weird happened with my recent Facebook ad campaigns. I was chasing that "perfect" CTR – you know, aiming for those industry-touted 4-7% numbers. But consistently, the campaigns hovering around 1-2% were *crushing* it in terms of ROAS and CPA. 

It really made me pause. We're so focused on vanity metrics, chasing what *looks* good, that we sometimes miss the bigger picture. Maybe audiences respond better to ads that feel a little less aggressively optimized, a bit more… genuine? It’s a reminder that in tech, sometimes the counterintuitive approach wins.
