## That Fuzzy Feeling on My Screen... and a Little Tech Reflection

Anyone else notice their phone screen looking a little… hazy lately? Mine has developed this strange film, and it's got me thinking. Just like a window seal failing on an old house, it feels like a small sign of wear and tear. It’s 2023, and we’re so attached to these devices. This tiny imperfection is a reminder that even our tech, for all its brilliance, isn't invincible, is it? Time for a screen protector, maybe a little digital decluttering too.
