**The Scroll and the Sizzle: When Tech Makes My GERD Worse**

Okay, real talk. As someone who’s spent the last few years navigating a frustrating battle with GERD and a sneaky hiatal hernia, I’ve become *very* aware of how seemingly small things can trigger a flare-up. And lately? It’s my phone. Specifically, the endless scroll. 

It started subtly, a little heartburn after a particularly long Instagram session. Then it escalated. Now, just the *thought* of diving into TikTok makes my chest tighten. I know, it sounds ridiculous, but I genuinely believe the constant stimulation – the bright screens, the rapid-fire videos – is contributing to the inflammation. 

I’ve been trying to be more mindful. I’ve even started using apps to limit my screen time, which feels almost… medieval. But let’s be honest, disconnecting isn’t exactly a natural instinct in 2023. 

It’s a weird paradox, isn’t it? We’re supposedly *connected* like never before, yet so much of that connection feels stressful and, frankly, uncomfortable.  I’m researching ways to manage this – blue light filters, mindful scrolling, even just putting my phone in another room during meal times. 

I’m sharing this because I think a lot of us are experiencing this silent struggle. Maybe you’re noticing a link between your tech habits and your body’s signals. Let’s talk about it in the comments – are you a scroll survivor too?
