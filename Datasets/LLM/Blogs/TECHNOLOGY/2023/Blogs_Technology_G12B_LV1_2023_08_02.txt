>## The Echo in the Zoom Room

Okay, so I've been thinking a lot lately about online spaces – specifically, how they're supposed to be safe, and whether they *actually* are. My company has a fantastic disability employee group, which is brilliant. They recently hosted a virtual “safe space” session on Zoom, meant for employees with disabilities to connect and share experiences. 

Except… it was recorded. 

The announcement felt a little glossed over, and honestly, the thought of my words, my vulnerabilities, potentially floating around somewhere feels… unsettling. I’m not alone in feeling this way, either. I’ve seen the ripple effect of anxiety in our group chat. 

It highlights a tricky tension, doesn’t it? We’re desperate for inclusivity and understanding, for platforms to feel seen, but technology can easily twist that intention. A recording, a screenshot… suddenly a space designed for vulnerability feels exposed. It’s a reminder that even with the best intentions, digital spaces need careful consideration and transparent boundaries. Maybe a quick poll beforehand next time? Just a thought.
