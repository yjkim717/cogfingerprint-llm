I finally caved and let my phone track my sleep last month. At first, the data was fascinatingâ€”seeing my deep sleep cycles charted out felt like a superpower. But now, I just wake up anxious, staring at a score that tells me I failed at a basic biological function. I'm starting to think the cost of this knowledge is the peace it replaced. Maybe ignorance really is bliss.
