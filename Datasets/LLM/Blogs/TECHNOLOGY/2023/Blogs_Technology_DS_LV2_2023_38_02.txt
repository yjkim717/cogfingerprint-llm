It’s 2023, and I’m still amazed at how my phone seems to know me better than I know myself. Just yesterday, I was chatting with a friend about hiking boots, and suddenly, ads for trail gear flooded my screen. It’s eerie, sure, but also strangely comforting—like a digital guardian angel nudging me toward things I didn’t even realize I needed.

But it makes me wonder: in this age of algorithms, are we losing the thrill of stumbling upon things by chance? That unexpected joy of discovery feels like a relic sometimes. Technology connects us, yet I can’t help but miss the beautiful accidents it quietly erases.
