"As I navigated my neighborhood alleys in 2023, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with the clutter. Collection carts left behind after trash pickup were taking over. It's not just an eyesore; they're a navigation nightmare. I started thinking - with smart waste management on the rise, why not integrate alley-friendly tech to keep our urban spaces clutter-free? It's time to rethink waste disposal and make our cities more livable, one alley at a time."
