The drip, drip, drip was back. For the third time, I watched a tiny bead of water trace a path down the inside of my brand-new trailer’s slide-out. After two separate trips to the dealer, countless promises, and a stack of repair invoices, the leak had returned. The initial excitement of ownership had been completely washed away, replaced by the creeping dread of water damage and mold. I felt like I was fighting a losing battle. That’s when a friend mentioned our state’s lemon law. It felt like a long shot, but with the warranty proving useless and the dealer’s fixes clearly not holding, it might be my only recourse to get a safe, functional vehicle or my money back.

Remember when "the cloud" was this magical, futuristic concept? In 2023, it’s just… where my stuff lives. My photos, my work documents, the half-written novel I’ll probably never finish—it’s all floating in some server farm.

The other day, my internet died. I sat there, cut off from my own life. I couldn't access a file I needed, couldn't even look at my vacation pictures. It was a stark reminder of how deeply we’ve outsourced our memories and our productivity. The cloud is incredibly convenient, but it’s made our digital lives strangely fragile. I’m starting to think a little local backup isn't such a bad idea.
