"As I dug into my Facebook ad data in 2023, I stumbled upon a surprising insight: campaigns with modest 1-2% CTRs outperformed those with eye-catching 4-7% CTRs in terms of ROAS and CPA. It turns out, high CTR doesn't always translate to better ROI. This counterintuitive finding has reshaped my approach to campaign optimization, teaching me to look beyond vanity metrics and focus on what truly drives conversions."
