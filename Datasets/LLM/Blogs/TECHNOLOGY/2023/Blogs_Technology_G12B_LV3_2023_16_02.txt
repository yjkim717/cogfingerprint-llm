## Is That Skill Worth It? My Baldur's Gate 3 Lockpicking Dilemma

Okay, so I've been *deep* in Baldur's Gate 3 lately, and a question’s been nagging at me: is dedicating a character to lockpicking truly worth it? Early access is fantastic, but it’s got me second-guessing my builds. Do I really need someone solely focused on jiggling tumblers when spells and clever dialogue options often provide a workaround?

It’s a surprisingly relatable feeling, isn't it? We’re all constantly evaluating our "skills" – tech skills, hobbies, even social ones – and wondering if the investment is paying off in 2023. Sometimes, the path of least resistance (or the most versatile spell!) just seems more appealing. What do *you* think?
