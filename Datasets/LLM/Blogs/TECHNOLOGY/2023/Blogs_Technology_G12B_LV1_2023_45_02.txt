>## The Case of the Missing Type Check

Okay, so I hit a weird one in Kotlin the other day. I was wrestling with some generic code, trying to set a value on a `KProperty` – you know, the reflection API stuff.  Expected it to be straightforward, right? Nope. 

The compiler just... wasn't checking the type properly. I was passing in a `String` where an `Int` was expected, and it happily compiled!  Spent a good hour debugging before I realized the issue wasn't *my* code, but a surprising quirk in how Kotlin handles type checking with generics and reflection. 

It’s a good reminder that even in languages we think we know well, there are still edge cases lurking. Definitely filed a bug report – hopefully, it'll be ironed out soon! Anyone else encountered this oddity?
