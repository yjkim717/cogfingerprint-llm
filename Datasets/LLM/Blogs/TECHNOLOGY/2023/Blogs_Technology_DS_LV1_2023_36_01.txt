It’s funny how technology sneaks up on you. Just a few years ago, my trusty diesel felt like the smartest choice—rugged, efficient, and built for the long haul. But now, in 2023, I’m eyeing the Citroën C5 Aircross and wondering if I’m clinging to the past.

Living in the province, I need reliability, not just novelty. Do I stick with the familiar diesel, switch to a modern gasoline model, or dip my toes into the hybrid world (though plug-ins feel like a bridge too far for my rural routes)? It’s a quiet tech revolution happening right in my driveway, forcing me to rethink what “progress” really means for my daily drives.
