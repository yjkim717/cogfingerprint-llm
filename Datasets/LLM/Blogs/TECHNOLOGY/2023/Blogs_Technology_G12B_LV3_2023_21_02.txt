## The Quest for Audio Bliss (and Comfort!) in Gaming

Okay, fellow gamers, let's talk headphones. I've been on a mission lately – a quest, really – for that perfect audio experience without breaking the bank. Specifically, I need something open-back, delivering that wonderfully neutral sound crucial for pinpointing in-game audio cues, but *also* comfortable enough to wear with glasses. Apparently, Pioneer’s a no-go for some of us (sound profile and closed-back woes!), and the beloved Philips SHP9500 seems elusive in Germany. It's a surprisingly tricky hunt in 2023, but the search continues! Any recommendations out there?
