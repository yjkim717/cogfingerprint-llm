### The Ghost in the Machine: My Quest for Automated Backups

It all started with a pang of guilt. There, on my desk, sat three USB drives, each a silent sentinel of a different month’s data. My manual backup "system" was less of a system and more of a hopeful ritual I kept forgetting to perform. In 2023, with AI writing sonnets and cars driving themselves, my data's safety relied on my flaky memory. Enough was enough.

I dove into the homelab rabbit hole, discovering Restic—a brilliant, open-source backup tool. It was perfect, but it demanded consistency. My "Aha!" moment was realizing I could make my computer recognize each USB drive as the *same* backup location, no matter which physical drive I plugged in. The key was `/etc/fstab`, the unsung hero of the Linux world that tells your system what to do with storage.

By assigning each drive a consistent label, like `BACKUP_ROTATION`, and creating a permanent mount point (`/mnt/backup`), I wrote a simple fstab entry. Now, when I plug in "USB Drive A," it automatically mounts to `/mnt/backup`. Restic, running on a cron job, happily backs up to that location. When it's time to rotate, I swap it for "USB Drive B," and the exact same thing happens. The machine sees no difference.

There’s a quiet satisfaction in building a system that just works. My three USB drives are no longer a source of anxiety but a seamless, automated cycle. It’s a small victory, but it’s a reminder that the smartest technology isn't always the most complex; sometimes, it's the simple, elegant script that finally lets you stop worrying and rest easy.
