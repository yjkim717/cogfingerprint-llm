"Ghosting Got You Down? The Quest for Mutual Disclosure in Online Dating" 

In today's digital age, online dating has become the norm. But with it comes the unsettling risk of ghosting. As I navigated the world of dating websites in 2023, I found myself wondering: what if there's a way to reveal identities simultaneously, ensuring mutual disclosure? I began searching for a platform that allows anonymous chatting, only revealing identities when both parties are ready. It's 2023, and it's surprising that such a feature isn't standard. I'm not alone in this quest - many are seeking a more transparent online dating experience, free from the fear of ghosting.
