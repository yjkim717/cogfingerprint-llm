## Where Did My Smooth Tabs Go? (And What I'm Learning About Tech Obsolescence)

Anyone else feel a pang of digital loss? I just noticed my beloved 'Smooth Gestures Plus' Chrome extension vanished from the Chrome Webstore. Seriously bummed – those smooth tab-switching gestures were a tiny joy in my workday! 

It's a strange feeling, realizing a tool you relied on is just…gone. It’s a sharp reminder that the tech landscape is constantly shifting. Now I’m on the hunt for a replacement, exploring new tab management options. It's not just about functionality; it’s about finding that *feel* again, that little bit of workflow magic. Anyone have recommendations?



Hope this suits your needs!
