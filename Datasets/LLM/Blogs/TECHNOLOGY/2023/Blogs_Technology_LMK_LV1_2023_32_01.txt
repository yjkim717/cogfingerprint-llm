As I watched a recent YouTube video, I couldn't help but feel a shiver down my spine. It highlighted a disturbing issue with certain APC UPS units, where the aluminum transformer cores were improperly soldered, posing a significant fire hazard. The thought of these units being used in homes and offices, silently humming away, is unsettling. In 2023, with our increasing reliance on technology, it's alarming to think that such electrical faults can go unnoticed. It's a stark reminder to stay vigilant and prioritize safety when it comes to our tech.
