"As I embark on building my home lab server with Proxmox and ZFS, I'm faced with a daunting decision: how much RAM do I really need for my 29TB RAIDZ1 storage setup? I've always been drawn to the promise of ZFS - its ability to ensure data integrity and provide flexible storage management is hard to resist. But, as I dive deeper, I'm reminded that ZFS is a hungry beast when it comes to memory. I've read horror stories of systems grinding to a halt due to insufficient RAM. So, I'm left wondering: what's the sweet spot? I've seen recommendations ranging from 32GB to 128GB or more. As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that building a home lab is as much about experimentation as it is about getting the specs just right. For now, I'll have to strike a balance between performance and budget - and hope that my future self won't be cursing my decisions."
