**Little Wins & Big Shifts in the Web**

It’s funny how a tiny update can feel like a real signal, isn’t it? I was just browsing the web development landscape last week, and stumbled upon the Starlite framework announcing a fresh logo and a serious push towards v2.0.  It reminded me of that feeling when you finally get a piece of software – a little framework, a small library – to *just* work, and it’s suddenly so much smoother.

But Starlite’s plans for v2.0? That’s more than just a polish. They’re talking about major improvements, and a revised versioning strategy – embracing SemVer, which feels like a really smart move.  It’s a good reminder that even in the fast-moving world of tech, consistent evolution and thoughtful design are key.  Sometimes, it’s the quiet updates that build a stronger foundation. What small wins have you noticed lately?
