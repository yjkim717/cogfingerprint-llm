**Lost in the Gears: Why Do Empires Always Win in Strategy Games?**

I’ve been utterly consumed lately by *Europa Universalis IV*, *Crusader Kings III*, and *Hearts of Iron IV*.  Seriously, I’ve spent hours building sprawling empires, conquering territories, and generally indulging in glorious (and often brutal) historical simulations. And a nagging question keeps popping up: why do European powers *always* dominate? 

It’s fascinating, isn’t it?  These games often portray a relentless European march across the globe.  I started wondering if it’s purely about superior military technology – the cannons and muskets that seemed to give them an edge. But maybe it’s something deeper. Perhaps it’s the constant state of warfare, the near-constant pressure of neighboring rivals, that creates a feedback loop of dominance.  It makes you think about how history itself – a tapestry woven with territorial conflict – might be reflected in these digital worlds.  What do you think?
