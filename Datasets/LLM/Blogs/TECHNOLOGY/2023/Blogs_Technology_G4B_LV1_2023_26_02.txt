**Echoes of an Old Build**

It’s funny how a single thread on Reddit can pull up a flood of memories. I stumbled across a post about an Intel i7-6700, motherboard, and DDR3 memory being sold on a hardware swap forum – a setup from back in the day. Suddenly, I was back in 2015, painstakingly building my first real PC. It wasn't flashy, but it got the job done.  These older components remind you of a simpler time, a tangible connection to the tech that shaped those early years.  #retrocomputing #hardware #memories
