As I rewatched Critical Role's Campaign 1, Episode 109 recently, I was struck by Sam Riegel's hilarious reaction to a prank on Scanlan. In that moment, I realized how our online interactions can be just as meta-gamed as a D&D session. In 2023, with social media dictating so much of our digital lives, it's refreshing to see a group of friends embracing the absurdity of it all. Sam's laughter was contagious, and it made me appreciate the value of not taking ourselves too seriously online.
