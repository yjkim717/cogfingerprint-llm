## The Year I Almost Gave Up on My GPS (and What It Taught Me)

Remember when a GPS was a *thing*? A clunky, suction-cupped device that sometimes argued with you about which way to turn? I do. For years, my old Garmin was my steadfast companion, guiding me through countless road trips and errands. It wasn't fancy, but it *worked*.

Then my phone started doing it. And then the car's built-in navigation became surprisingly decent. Suddenly, I was surrounded by "smart" mapping systems. The sheer volume of data, the constant updates, the voice assistants... it felt overwhelming. Honestly, there were a few weeks where I just stubbornly stuck to paper maps, clinging to the familiar.

But I realized something: resisting change isn't always the answer. It’s about adapting, learning the new tools, and appreciating how far we've come. Now, I'm happily accepting real-time traffic updates and finding hidden cafes thanks to my phone. It’s a little less… cozy, maybe. But undeniably, *smarter*.
