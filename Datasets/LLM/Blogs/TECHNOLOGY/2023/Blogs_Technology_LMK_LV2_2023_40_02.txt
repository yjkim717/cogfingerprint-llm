"Decoding the Syntax: Unraveling the Mystery of Man Pages"

As I dove into customizing my workflow with bspwm in 2023, I found myself entangled in the complexities of its man pages. The syntax used was unfamiliar, and I couldn't help but wonder - what's the logic behind it? Is it a variant of EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form), or something entirely different? My curiosity was piqued. I began to dig deeper, comparing the notation used in bspwm's documentation to EBNF, searching for answers. As I navigated through the world of syntax definitions and grammar notations, I realized that understanding the language of man pages is a skill in itself. It's a skill that can empower us to unlock the full potential of the tools we use. Join me as I explore the intricacies of syntax definitions and uncover the secrets hidden within the lines of code.
