**The R-Evolution of Data Play**

It’s wild how quickly things change, right? I’ve been diving deep into the world of data lately, and it feels like Python’s PandasAI is sparking a real movement.  I’m specifically hunting for an R equivalent – a way to build intelligent dataframes with a little AI magic.
