As a remote teacher in 2023, I'm constantly exploring tools that facilitate seamless collaboration. I recently wondered if WeChat's video chat feature allows screen sharing, enabling me to watch students' edits in real-time. This functionality is crucial for effective remote teaching. I'm not alone in this quest - many educators are seeking intuitive platforms to enhance virtual learning. Can WeChat bridge this gap, or should we consider alternative solutions?
