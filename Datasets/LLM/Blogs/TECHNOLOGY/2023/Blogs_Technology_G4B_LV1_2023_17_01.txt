**My USB Backup Obsession (and Why It’s a Little Chaotic)**

Okay, confession time: I’ve been completely consumed by building a ridiculously DIY backup system for my home lab. I’m using Restic – it’s fantastic – but I really wanted a physical, offline component, so I’m relying on USB drives. The dream was simple: backup, then automatically mount them. 

Turns out, it’s not *that* simple!  I’ve been wrestling with `fstab` entries and the dreaded `-a` flag to get everything to mount correctly. It’s a frustrating dance of permissions and device recognition.  Let’s just say my evenings have been spent troubleshooting mount errors. 

Honestly, it’s a brilliant learning experience, but also a reminder that even the coolest tech still needs a little human intervention.  Anyone else building their own backup solutions? Share your struggles (and triumphs!) below!
