"Navigating the US Visa System as a Third Country National in 2023" can be a challenging experience. As someone in Canada on a non-US visa, I recently found myself needing to secure a J1 visa appointment. I was relieved to discover that I was eligible for an expedited appointment. However, I was faced with a new dilemma - could I choose a consulate that wasn't the one with the earliest available appointment? After some research, I learned that it's possible to select a different consulate, allowing for more flexibility in the visa application process. This flexibility was a game-changer for my travel plans.
