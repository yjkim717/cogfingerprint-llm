## The Comfort of Familiar Tech

There's something comforting about sticking with what you know, isn't there? My laptop, a slightly battered 2015 model, feels like an old friend. It’s seen countless drafts, late-night coding sessions, and now, just everyday browsing. While the latest models boast incredible speed, this one *knows* me. It’s a digital echo of my journey these past years – a little slower, perhaps, but full of history and reliably *mine*. It's a reminder that progress isn't always about the newest gadget.
