**The Price of a Dream**

Sitting in a cafe near the Cornell Tech campus in 2023, my phone buzzed with another H1B lottery update. "Not Selected." Again. My dream of their CS ME program felt further away than ever, the $80,000+ cost of attendance a fortress wall.

But then I dug deeper. I found stories of students who’d secured full scholarships, turning that impossible sum into a real possibility. It wasn't just about coding skills; it was about a unique project idea, a vision for urban tech. The high cost wasn't a stop sign—it was a challenge to be more creative, to build a profile so compelling they’d want to invest in me. The visa is a hurdle, but the first step is earning that ticket.
