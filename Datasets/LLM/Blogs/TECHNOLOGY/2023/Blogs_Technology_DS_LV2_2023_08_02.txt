The other day, I got an invite to a "safe space" online event for neurodivergent employees. My first thought? Great, finally. My second? Wait—it’s being recorded. Suddenly, that safe space felt like a stage.

As someone with Asperger’s, I’m used to masking in my corporate job, but the idea of my unfiltered self being archived by the company made my stomach twist. Could I really share openly, knowing it might be reviewed later by HR or my manager?

I’m still deciding whether to log on or quietly exit. In 2023, technology promises connection, but sometimes, it just adds another layer to navigate—another performance to give.
