**The Scroll & The Silence**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re more connected than ever before, glued to our screens, bombarded with information. And yet, sometimes, I feel utterly, profoundly *disconnected*. Lately, I’ve been battling something I can only describe as…brain fog. It’s not a dramatic, head-splitting migraine, but a persistent, dull cloud that makes concentrating feel like wading through molasses. 

I know I’m not alone.  I’ve been reading a lot about chronic illnesses – the frustrating kind that doctors can’t quite pinpoint – and a surprising number of people describe a similar experience. That feeling of being trapped in your own head, a constant hum of anxiety fueled by the sheer *volume* of everything.

And that’s where the tech part comes in. I used to find solace in scrolling, a mindless way to fill the gaps. But now, it feels…heavy. Like I’m consuming everyone else’s highlight reel while my own life feels stubbornly grey.  

This year, I'm trying something different.  I’ve started scheduling “digital detox” blocks – even just an hour a day – where I put my phone away and just *be*. It’s terrifying, honestly.  The urge to check, to refresh, is intense. But I’m learning that sometimes, the most valuable connection isn’t found online, but in the quiet space between the scroll and the silence. 

Has anyone else found themselves feeling this way lately?
