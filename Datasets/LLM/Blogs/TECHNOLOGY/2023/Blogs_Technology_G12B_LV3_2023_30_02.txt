## The Tightrope Walk: Tech Dreams and Visa Realities

It’s 2023, and the tech world feels both exhilarating and… precarious. I'm staring down the barrel of a big decision – pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Cornell Tech. The program is incredible, a real dream, but the financial realities are hitting hard. 

The H1B visa process is notoriously stressful, and the uncertainty surrounding it has thrown a wrench into my long-term plans. Honestly, the thought of taking on significant debt while navigating that process feels overwhelming. I’m exploring every avenue, including the possibility of a full scholarship. 

It’s a vulnerable feeling, admitting you need help to chase your ambitions. But I'm hoping sharing this journey, and connecting with others facing similar challenges, can be a source of support and maybe even some helpful advice. Anyone else walking this tightrope?
