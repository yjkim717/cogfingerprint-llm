>## The Algorithm Made Me Question Everything (and My Wi-Fi Password)

Okay, let’s be honest. How many of us are feeling… a little *off* lately? Like we’re living in a meticulously curated echo chamber? I know I am. It really hit me the other day when I realized my recommended playlists were less “music I enjoy” and more “a very specific, slightly unsettling version of me the algorithm thinks I should be.”

It started subtly. A few extra suggestions for productivity apps. Then, a deluge of articles about minimalist living. Now? My feed is practically screaming at me to buy a standing desk and learn calligraphy. 

It's a bit like a D&D campaign gone wrong, isn't it? You start with a simple quest, but the DM (in this case, a complex web of code) keeps throwing curveballs designed to… control the battlefield, I guess? My attention, my interests, my very sense of self.

And it got me thinking. Are we, as a society, building characters – digital personas – that are easily manipulated? Are we letting these systems dictate our choices, our desires? I'm not saying ditch the internet entirely. But maybe, just maybe, it's time to consciously disrupt the flow. To choose something *weird*, something unexpected, just to throw the algorithm off its game.

First step? I’m learning to knit. Don't tell the algorithm. It'll probably start recommending sheep farming tutorials next. And I’m definitely changing my Wi-Fi password. Just in case.
