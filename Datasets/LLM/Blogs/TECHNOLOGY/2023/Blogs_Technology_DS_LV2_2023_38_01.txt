It’s 2023, and I’m knee-deep in R code when a colleague asks, “Is there a PandasAI for R?” My heart sank a little. As much as I love R’s statistical prowess, the allure of AI generating insights with a simple prompt is undeniable. It got me thinking: are we on the cusp of a revolution, or just adding another layer between us and our data? Sometimes, the most profound questions aren’t about what’s possible, but what we’re ready to embrace.
