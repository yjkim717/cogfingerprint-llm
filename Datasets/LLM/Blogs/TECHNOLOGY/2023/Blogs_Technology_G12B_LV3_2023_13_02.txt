## The Unexpected Classroom: WeChat and Remote Learning Adventures

It's 2023, and remote teaching is still a thing! I've been experimenting with WeChat for my lessons, trying to make it feel less… distant. The biggest challenge? Seeing a student’s work *live* while we chat. Screen sharing is one piece, but real-time collaboration – watching them edit a document together – feels like the missing link. Exploring this feels a little wild, but potentially game-changing for engagement!
