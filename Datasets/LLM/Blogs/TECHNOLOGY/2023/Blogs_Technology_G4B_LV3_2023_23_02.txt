**The Endless Scroll: Waiting for a Digital Home**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We spend so much time *searching* for things online – jobs, connections, even just the perfect avocado – and yet, when it comes to something as fundamental as a place to live, the process feels stuck in the past. I’ve been wrestling with a similar feeling lately, watching the endless scroll of Copenhagen’s housing waiting list. 

It’s not just about the time, though. It’s the *disappointment* of repeatedly renewing applications, years stretching out like a digital void. We’re told technology should streamline everything, make things easier, but applying for housing feels…analog. Like sending a letter into the abyss. 

There’s a strange parallel to the way we consume content these days. We’re bombarded with options, constantly refreshing, hoping for a perfect fit, only to be met with “sold out” or “waitlist.”  Maybe we’re so used to instant gratification that the patience required for something as vital as a home feels almost alien. 

It makes you wonder – are we building a future where even our most basic needs are governed by a frustrating, protracted wait?
