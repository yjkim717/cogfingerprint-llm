>## The Algorithm of Annoyance

It's funny how tech, meant to streamline life, can sometimes just… amplify existing frustrations. Lately, I've been thinking about how online forums like Reddit become echo chambers for everyday annoyances. Just saw a thread about collection carts blocking alleys in Lethbridge – a surprisingly relatable gripe! It made me realize how quickly a simple inconvenience, once shared digitally, can snowball into a collective venting session. Progress, huh? Maybe we need an algorithm for *reducing* frustration.
