**The Page Limit Panic**

Remember that feeling? That frantic scramble to polish a paper, fielding feedback, and staring at a looming page limit? I just went through it again with a recent submission to ICLR. It’s weird, right? We’re building incredibly complex AI, but sometimes the smallest things – typos, a meta-review suggestion – feel like mountains. 

It made me think: how much tweaking *is* acceptable?  Is a perfectly polished, slightly longer paper actually better than a concise, brilliant one?  It’s a frustrating dance, isn’t it? #ICLR #research #writing

Do you want me to tweak it further or perhaps create a different version with a slightly different focus?
