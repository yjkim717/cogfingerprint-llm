The irony of being a self-employed tech blogger in 2023. I spend my days raving about the democratizing power of technology, yet struggle to make ends meet. As someone living with schizophrenia, the pressure to constantly produce content can be overwhelming. The constant ping of notifications is a reminder that my mental health is always on the line. To make matters worse, some anti-capitalist commenters accuse me of perpetuating the very system I'm trying to critique - that I'm just another cog in the machine, profiting off the backs of others. The truth is, I'm barely scraping by. My freelance work is a hustle, and the financial struggle is real. Still, I'm determined to keep sharing my story, and using technology to amplify marginalized voices. It's a delicate balance, but one I'm willing to fight for.
