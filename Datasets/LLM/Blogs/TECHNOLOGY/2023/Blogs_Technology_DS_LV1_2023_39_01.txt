It’s funny how we grow attached to little digital tools. For years, Smooth Gestures Plus was my trusty sidekick—a flick of the mouse to navigate tabs felt like magic. Then, one day in 2023, it vanished from the Chrome Web Store. Just gone. It left a quiet hole in my browsing routine, a reminder of how fleeting our tech dependencies can be. Now I’m on the hunt again, hoping to rediscover that effortless flow. Sometimes progress feels like starting over.
