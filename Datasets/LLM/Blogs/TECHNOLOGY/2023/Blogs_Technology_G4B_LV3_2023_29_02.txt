**The Quiet Frustration of C**

There’s a certain elegance to C, a brutal simplicity that’s always fascinated me. But lately, I’ve been caught in a familiar frustration – that nagging feeling that a language can be *better*. Like a well-loved, slightly worn sweater, C has its charm, but sometimes you crave a fresh, more organized design. 

I saw a Reddit thread the other day discussing improvements, and the push for namespaces and clearer type declarations really resonated. It’s a reminder that even the most established technologies need a little nudge towards clarity and maintainability.  Don’t get me wrong, I love C, but 2023 is making me wonder if a little language evolution wouldn’t be welcome.
