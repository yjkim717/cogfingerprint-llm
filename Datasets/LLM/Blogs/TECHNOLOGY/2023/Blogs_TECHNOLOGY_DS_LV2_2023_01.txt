### The Blue Light Blackout

It wasn't the streetlamp outside my window keeping me up anymore. In 2023, my insomnia had a new, insidious source: the cold, constant glow of my own screens. I’d tried every "night mode" and blue light filter, but my brain was still wired, chasing digital ghosts long after I logged off.

My "blackout curtain" moment came when I finally instituted a hard, no-excuses digital curfew. An hour before bed, the phone goes in another room, the laptop lid closes, and I’m left with just a book and the quiet. It felt extreme at first, like I was missing out. But the payoff was immediate. The real blackout wasn't about blocking light from the outside; it was about silencing the noise from within. My best sleep hack wasn't an app—it was the power button.
