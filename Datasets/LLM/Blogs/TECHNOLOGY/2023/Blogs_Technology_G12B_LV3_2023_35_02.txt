>## Lost in the Machine, Found in the Text

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about how technology shapes us, almost like a sprawling, invisible network. It reminded me of a Reddit thread I stumbled upon discussing Thomas Pynchon's *The Atrocity Exhibition* and its connection to *Gravity's Rainbow*. Both novels, particularly that Pynchon one, seem to grapple with the feeling of being overwhelmed by systems, by the relentless churn of machinery and imagery. 

It’s a strangely relevant feeling in 2023, isn't it? We're constantly bombarded with data, algorithms, and notifications. Maybe diving into a dense, challenging book like *The Atrocity Exhibition* can offer a weird sort of clarity – a way to process the noise.
