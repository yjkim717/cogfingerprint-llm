## The Waiting Game & Algorithmic Anxiety

Anyone else feel like 2023 has been one long queue? Seriously, from concert tickets to restaurant reservations, it seems everything requires a digital wait. I was just reading about someone navigating the J1 visa process – a real logistical hurdle! – and it hit me: we’ve outsourced so much of our patience to algorithms.

It’s strange, isn't it? Relying on a system to decide when we get what we need, whether it’s a visa appointment or a coveted product launch.  I wish there was a ‘skip the line’ button for life's important moments.  Just a little reassurance that the system *sees* you, and understands the urgency. It's a reminder that behind the tech, there are real people and real timelines. And sometimes, all you can do is refresh the page and breathe.
