### The Unseen Cost of the "Always-On" Dream

Remember when we thought technology would liberate us? In 2023, my smartphone is both my office and my ball and chain. The promise was freedom—to work from anywhere, to be your own boss. The reality is a different kind of trap.

I’m constantly “on,” chasing notifications and algorithm-friendly content just to stay afloat. That little device in my pocket, the symbol of modern connection, often feels like the very engine of a hustle culture I never meant to buy into. It monetizes my attention and sells it back to me as anxiety.

I’m not building a dream; I’m feeding a machine with my time and mental peace. The real innovation we need isn't a faster phone, but the courage to sometimes switch it off and reclaim the quiet moments that truly make us human.
