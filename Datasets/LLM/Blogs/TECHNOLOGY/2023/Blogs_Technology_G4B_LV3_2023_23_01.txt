**The Ghosts in the Machine: When ‘Good Enough’ Just Isn’t**

Let’s be honest, building an online business in 2023 feels like constantly wrestling with technology that’s… well, *older* than you are. I’ve been staring down the barrel of an Opencart store for a while now, and lately, it’s felt less like a tool and more like a stubborn ghost. 

It started with little things – frustrating framework limitations, a feeling that the system just *couldn’t* bend to my needs. Then it blossomed into a full-blown frustration with the underlying architecture. It’s a perfectly functional ecommerce platform, sure, but it’s a legacy system clinging to outdated ideas. 

I’m craving something simpler, something that anticipates growth instead of fighting it. The thought of migrating feels daunting, a huge undertaking, but the alternative – continuing to squeeze a modern vision into a prehistoric box – is even less appealing.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best investment isn’t in the newest shiny thing, but in finding a system that truly supports your journey.
