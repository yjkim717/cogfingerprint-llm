**The Quiet Frustration of Empty Lists**

Anyone else ever stare blankly at a PowerShell script, willing it to *just work*? I hit a frustrating wall last week, chasing a seemingly simple task: export all members of a specific Active Directory group. It felt almost…personal. 

I’d built a script to recursively grab group membership, and I was confident. Yet, the output was stubbornly empty. Hours were spent wrestling with the command, double-checking the group name, questioning my logic. It’s that quiet, simmering frustration – the one where you feel like the technology is deliberately ignoring you.

Turns out, a tiny typo in the recursive lookup was the culprit. It felt so small, so insignificant, yet it derailed the whole process. It's a good reminder that even in the world of complex systems, the devil is often in the details. And sometimes, the most rewarding feeling is simply finding that one little mistake and watching the list finally populate.  What's your tech frustration story?
