**The Ghost in the vCenter**

Okay, confession time. I’ve been wrestling with a particularly frustrating little gremlin in my VMware environment this week. It started with a planned upgrade – a routine vCenter and vSphere refresh, really – and ended with a blinking, accusing “Evaluation Version” message. Seriously? 

I’d meticulously checked our licenses, double-checked the upgrade paths, and felt pretty confident. But there it was, a digital ghost haunting my infrastructure. It took a solid afternoon of digging through logs and VMware support chat to realize the upgrade process hadn't fully propagated the new license details. 

It’s a stark reminder that even with the most carefully planned tech deployments, things can still go sideways. It’s easy to get caught up in the "shiny new feature" excitement and forget the foundational details.  This experience reinforced the importance of thorough validation *after* any major change.  Anyone else had a similar scare lately?
