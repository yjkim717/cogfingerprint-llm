**Horizon’s Next Chapter: Who’s Really Watching?**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching a tech giant like Broadcom swoop in and acquire VMware Horizon EUC. I’ve been chewing on the possibilities, and a nagging thought keeps surfacing: HPE. Seriously. While Citrix certainly has a vested interest, the sheer scale and focus of HPE’s existing infrastructure solutions feels like a more natural fit for Horizon’s future. 

It’s a shift, for sure.  Broadcom’s strategic moves are always interesting, and I’m curious to see how they’ll ultimately leverage this powerful platform.  Anyone else pondering this? #VMware #Broadcom #HPE #HorizonEUC #TechSpeculation
