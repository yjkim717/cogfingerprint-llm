## The ZFS Rabbit Hole & My Home Lab Headaches (and Maybe Yours Too?)

Okay, confession time. I’ve been staring at my Proxmox server with a slightly panicked expression for the better part of a week. It all started with wanting to finally implement RAIDZ1 with ZFS – a move I *thought* would be a straightforward upgrade for my home lab storage. 

Turns out, ZFS is…complicated. Specifically, the memory requirements. Everyone throws around that “1GB RAM per TB” rule, and it’s been rattling around in my head. Is it gospel? Is it a suggestion? Will my poor 32GB server actually choke on a relatively modest 8TB pool?

I’ve spent hours reading forums, poring over documentation (which, let’s be honest, can be dense), and generally feeling like I’ve fallen down a very deep, very technical rabbit hole.  It’s a stark reminder that even seemingly simple upgrades can be unexpectedly complex when you’re venturing into the world of data integrity and advanced storage solutions. 

Anyone else wrestling with ZFS and feeling a little overwhelmed?  Let's commiserate (and share tips!) in the comments.
