## The Unexpected Hiccup in My Virtual World

So, you know how sometimes technology just… throws you a curveball? I experienced one of those moments recently, and it got me thinking about the layers of abstraction we build around our infrastructure.

We’re deep into 2023, and virtualization is, for many of us, just *how things are*. VMware's vSphere has been a cornerstone for years. We build our environments on it, relying on its stability and predictability.  Recently, we undertook an upgrade, moving from a vSphere 7 environment to version 8. Pretty standard stuff, right?

Well, not quite. After the upgrade, one of our ESXi hosts stubbornly insisted it was still running vSphere 7 within vCenter. Now, I’ve seen weird things before, but this felt… particularly stubborn.  We double-checked configurations, scrutinized logs, and felt that familiar creeping sense of “what did we miss?”

Turns out, the culprit was surprisingly simple: a licensing issue.  vCenter, for reasons that remain a little murky, wasn’t properly recognizing the new license assigned to the host.  It was essentially stuck in evaluation mode, creating a phantom version report.

A quick license check and re-activation solved the problem instantly. It was a stark reminder that even in complex systems, the most frustrating issues can sometimes stem from the most basic elements.  It also highlighted how heavily we rely on the management layer (vCenter) to accurately reflect the underlying reality of our infrastructure.  A good lesson learned: always double-check the licenses!
