>## The Paradox of Playing Hide-and-Seek Online

It's 2023, and we’re *still* navigating the weird landscape of online dating. I recently had a conversation with a friend who perfectly articulated a frustration I think many of us feel: the constant, low-stakes game of cat and mouse. You spend weeks chatting, build a little connection, and then…poof. Ghosted.

It got me thinking. What if there was a dating website that flipped the script? A platform where, after a certain point, you *both* simultaneously reveal your real identities – photos, names, the whole shebang. No more hiding behind curated profiles and vague interests. 

It sounds a bit drastic, I know. But wouldn't it eliminate the incentive to disappear? Wouldn't it force a bit more honesty and accountability? Maybe it’s a pipe dream, but I’m starting to wonder if a little less mystery is exactly what we need.
