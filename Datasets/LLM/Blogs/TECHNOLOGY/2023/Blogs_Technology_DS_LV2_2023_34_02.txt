Remember that sleek new tablet I bought in early 2023, convinced it would revolutionize my productivity? For the first month, it was magic. I was a digital da Vinci, sketching ideas and organizing my life with a stylus.

Then, the first phantom glitch hit. The screen froze mid-swipe. A hard reset fixed it, but the spell was broken. Then came the second freeze, and a third. Each "fix" was temporary, a digital band-aid on a festering software wound.

Now, this expensive rectangle of potential mostly collects dust, a monument to a promise technology couldn't keep. It’s a lemon. And I’m left wondering if our relentless upgrade cycle is just a race to find the next beautifully packaged disappointment. Sometimes, the old, reliable ways aren't so bad after all.
