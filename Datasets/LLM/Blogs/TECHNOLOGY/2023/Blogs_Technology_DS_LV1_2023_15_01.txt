### The Quest for the Perfect Blackout Curtain

My bedroom has become a graveyard for half-measures. I’ve tried the "room-darkening" panels from big-box stores and the "almost blackout" liners from online giants. Each one promised a cave-like darkness, but every morning, a sliver of stubborn sunlight would pierce through the seams, a personal betrayal that felt like a starting pistol for my day, long before I was ready.

This isn't just about interior design; it's a battle for basic sleep. Inspired by the deep, functional aesthetic of classic Americana and the no-nonsense utility of a Spanish *bodega's* thick *lagar* walls, I’ve given up on off-the-rack solutions. I’m now on the hunt for truly custom curtains, engineered for 100% light blocking. I’m not just buying window dressings anymore; I’m commissioning a shield. My sanity depends on it.

### My Digital Declutter of 2023

It hit me in early 2023. I was doomscrolling on my phone while a movie I’d been excited to watch played, ignored, on my TV. My laptop was open beside me, buzzing with notifications. I was consuming everything and enjoying nothing.

So, I started a digital declutter. I turned off all non-essential notifications. I deleted social media apps from my phone, relegating them to my desktop only. It was uncomfortable at first—that phantom limb feeling for a like or a update. But a quiet space emerged. I started reading actual books again, finishing them in days. I had longer, more present conversations.

The most profound tech lesson I learned this year was that the most powerful feature isn't a new algorithm or a faster processor; it's the "off" button. Reclaiming my attention has felt like the ultimate upgrade.
