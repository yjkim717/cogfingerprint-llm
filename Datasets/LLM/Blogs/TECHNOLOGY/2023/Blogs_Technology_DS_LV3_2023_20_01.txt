The constant hum of my phone used to be a comfort—a sign of connection, of life happening just a tap away. But in 2023, that digital buzz started to feel different. It wasn't just notifications; it was a low-grade static filling my head, a persistent brain fog I couldn't shake. I felt a strange, pervasive malaise, my thoughts sluggish as a frozen browser tab.

I went to medical professionals, describing this new anxiety, this feeling of being digitally waterlogged that often tipped into a quiet depression. I’d say, "I feel like my brain has too many tabs open," and they’d nod, but I could tell they didn't really get it. I felt unheard, trying to explain a sickness born from the very tools designed to make life easier.

It took stepping back—deleting apps, setting hard screen-time boundaries—to find clarity. The silence was uncomfortable at first, but in it, I found my focus returning. I realized my mental bandwidth is a finite resource, and in our hyper-connected world, guarding it isn't antisocial; it's an act of self-preservation.
