**The Algorithm Knows… or Does It?**

Okay, so I’ve been thinking a *lot* about how much our lives are now shaped by algorithms lately. It’s 2023, right? We’re swimming in data, and these invisible systems are making decisions about everything from what we buy to who gets a job. 

Recently, I was applying for a freelance graphic design role – a pretty straightforward process, I thought. But after a few weeks of silence, I noticed a strange pattern. Every platform I’d applied through seemed to be subtly pushing me toward *different* jobs, less aligned with my actual skills. It felt… curated. 

It made me think about the “blacklist” mentioned in that French civil servant’s story – a quiet exclusion, a judgment made without a real conversation.  Is this what’s happening here?  Are algorithms, designed to optimize efficiency, inadvertently creating these kinds of digital barriers? 

I don’t have the answers, honestly. But it’s unsettling to realize how easily we can be filtered, categorized, and potentially sidelined by systems we don’t fully understand. It’s a reminder that even in the age of connection, true agency still feels fragile.  What do you think? Are we being gently managed, or just… categorized?
