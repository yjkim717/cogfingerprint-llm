As I stood in front of the mirror, clipper in hand, I realized I'd accumulated quite the arsenal over the years. My trusty Wahl clippers had been faithfully serving me, but I was curious about switching to Oster 76. The question on my mind? What guard sizes would translate to my new clippers? After some digging, I discovered that the Oster 76's #4 and #6 guards weren't exact equivalents to my Wahl clippers' 4 and 6 - a lesson in the nuances of grooming technology in 2023.
