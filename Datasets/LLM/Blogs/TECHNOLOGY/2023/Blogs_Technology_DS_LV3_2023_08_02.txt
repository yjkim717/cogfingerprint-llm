I logged into the corporate disability group’s virtual meet-up last week, hoping for a genuine safe space. As someone with Asperger's, these moments of shared understanding are rare. The host began by assuring us this was a private, confidential conversation—a place to be our authentic selves.

Then came the casual, almost hidden, disclosure: "This session is being recorded for internal use."

The irony was sharp. My guard went up instantly. The very promise of safety was undermined by the red recording light. In 2023, when technology is meant to connect us, it often feels like it's just another tool for surveillance, even in spaces built on trust. That digital footprint loomed large, silencing the vulnerability I’d been ready to share.
