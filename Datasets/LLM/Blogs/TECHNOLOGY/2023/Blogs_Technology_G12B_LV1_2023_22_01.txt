## The Horizon's Shifting Clouds: What Does Broadcom's VMware Deal Mean for EUC?

Okay, so the Broadcom-VMware dust has settled, but the questions are *just* starting. Specifically, what's the future for VMware Horizon and its Endpoint User Computing (EUC) capabilities? It’s a fascinating puzzle to watch.

Broadcom’s reputation isn’t exactly built on nurturing innovation; they're known for optimization and, let’s be honest, streamlining. That got me thinking – could we see Horizon being absorbed, or even sold off?

The whispers around HPE and Citrix are particularly intriguing. HPE, with their existing infrastructure focus, could integrate Horizon to bolster their hybrid cloud offerings. Citrix, already a major player in the EUC space, might see it as a strategic acquisition to expand their reach.

Honestly, whichever way it goes, the EUC landscape is about to shift. It’s a reminder that even in the seemingly stable world of enterprise tech, things can change remarkably quickly. Anyone else feeling a little unsettled by all this?
