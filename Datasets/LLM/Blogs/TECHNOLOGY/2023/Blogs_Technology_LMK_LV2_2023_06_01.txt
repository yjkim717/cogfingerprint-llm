As I glance at my 10-year-old smartphone, I'm reminded of how fast technology evolves. My trusty device, still functioning well, feels outdated in 2023. I'm torn between upgrading to the latest model and appreciating its nostalgic value. This dilemma mirrors my relationship with my 2013 Mazda3 - a well-maintained companion that's showing its age. Do I preserve the past or embrace the new?
