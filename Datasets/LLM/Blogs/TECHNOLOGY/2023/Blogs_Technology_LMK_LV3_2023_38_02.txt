As I sat scrolling through my emails, I found myself pondering whether to reach out to professors before my upcoming PhD interview in neuroscience. In today's digital age, it's easy to get lost in the sea of online communication. I wondered, would emailing them to express my research interests be seen as genuine or just another example of over-reliance on technology? As I weighed my options, I realized that it's not just about the medium, but the message. By thoughtfully crafting an email, I could showcase my passion for the field and demonstrate my ability to communicate complex ideas effectively. In 2023, where technology dominates our lives, it's refreshing to see that a simple, well-written email can still make a meaningful connection. With a clearer mind, I hit compose, hoping to establish a meaningful dialogue with the professor.
