When I checked the appointment portal, the only available slot at my designated consulate was in 2026—that's simply not feasible. My question is urgent: am I restricted to requesting an expedited appointment only at that specific consulate, or can I apply for one at any Canadian consulate that has earlier availability?

### **Reflective Blog Post: The Year We Stopped Talking to Machines (2023)**

It hit me last week. I was trying to relax, but my mind was racing with to-do lists. Without thinking, I mumbled, "Hey Google, remind me to buy milk."

And it hit me—I wasn't talking to a person or even myself. I was casually issuing a command to my empty living room. In 2023, technology became so seamlessly woven into our lives that we stopped treating it like a tool and started treating it like a quiet, omnipresent roommate. We don't "use" the internet anymore; we just exist with it, whispering our needs into the air. It's convenient, sure, but it makes me wonder what other quiet, fundamental shifts we're just accepting without a second thought.
