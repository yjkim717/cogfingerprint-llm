It’s funny—I used to think technology was just about speed. Faster phones, quicker downloads, instant replies. But last week, my old laptop froze right before a big deadline, and I felt this strange sense of calm wash over me. Instead of panicking, I made tea and watched the rain outside.

In that quiet moment, I realized tech’s real gift isn’t efficiency; it’s the space it creates when it fails. We’re so plugged in, we forget how to just be. Now, I schedule "tech timeouts"—no screens, just me and my thoughts. It’s 2023, and maybe the most advanced tool we have is knowing when to disconnect. Funny how stillness feels like the ultimate upgrade.
