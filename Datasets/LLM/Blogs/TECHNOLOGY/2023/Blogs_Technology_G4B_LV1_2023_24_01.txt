**Pixels & Power Plays: Why Do We Always Think of War?**

I was just messing around with a historical strategy game the other day – you know, the ones where Europe consistently crushes everyone else? It got me thinking about why. We *always* see European empires dominating, and it’s almost always framed by military might. But I started wondering: was it *just* the tanks and cannons?

It feels almost cliché, right? Like we automatically assume superior technology equals victory. Yet, looking at the game’s mechanics, it’s almost like a lack of constant, widespread conflict actually fostered a kind of strategic innovation. 

Maybe, in 2023, we’re still clinging to that same narrative – that tech equals dominance – when a little more diverse thinking might be needed.  What do you think? #strategygames #history #technology #reflection

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps explore a slightly different angle?
