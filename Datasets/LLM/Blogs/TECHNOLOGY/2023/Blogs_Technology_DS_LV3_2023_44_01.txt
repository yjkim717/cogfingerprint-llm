It’s funny how we’re taught to accept certain things as permanent—like my old laptop’s sluggishness. Experts said its aging processor was the culprit, a hardware limit I couldn’t fix. I’d resigned myself to its slow boot-ups and endless loading icons.

Then, in 2023, I tried a new lightweight operating system on a whim. Suddenly, it was like I’d given the machine a second life. Boot time halved. Applications snapped open. It wasn't a hardware miracle, but a software one—optimizing what was already there.

It made me wonder about other "permanent" problems. Maybe some limitations aren't set in stone, but just waiting for the right update, the right perspective. Sometimes, healing—or a major upgrade—comes from where you least expect it.
