As I breathed new life into my old Asus Vivobook and Lenovo Duet with ChromeOS Flex in 2023, I realized the importance of a sturdy laptop hinge. Unlike the Duet's kickstand, a hinge allows for more flexible usage. If you're looking to revive a non-Chromebook device, consider ChromeOS Flex. But be mindful of the hardware - a reliable hinge is a must. Is it time to dust off that old laptop and give it a fresh start?
