**The Day My iOS App Refused to Launch**

Okay, tech confessions time. Last month, I was wrestling with a particularly frustrating issue deploying a Xamarin app to iOS. Suddenly, BAM! “ApplicationVerificationFailed” – the dreaded error message. Turns out, it was a ridiculously simple fix: a rogue code signing identity.

It really hammered home the importance of double-checking the basics in Visual Studio 2022.  Honestly, it’s a reminder that even seasoned developers can stumble – and that a little troubleshooting can save a whole lot of late nights!
