Living in a small town, I’ve always felt the double-edged sword of online dating. Last year, I matched with someone nearby—just a screen name and witty banter. But the anonymity made me nervous. What if it was my neighbor? My coworker’s cousin? The fear of "ghosting" felt even heavier here, where every face is familiar.

I wished for a platform where, once we felt a connection, we could hit a button and reveal our identities to each other at the same time. No more one-sided vulnerability. In 2023, as tech promises deeper connections, it’s ironic how a simple, mutual "unmasking" feature could restore the trust that algorithms often overlook. Sometimes, the most human solutions are hiding in plain sight.
