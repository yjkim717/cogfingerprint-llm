**The Ghost Printer of Windows 10**

Okay, so this week I had a mini-tech meltdown. My old HP printer – completely deleted from my Windows 10 settings – was *still* showing up! It was a frustrating little ghost. Turns out, a quick dive into the Print Management app actually did the trick. Seriously, it’s amazing how much control we have, and how easily things can get tangled. It reminded me that even with all the bells and whistles of modern tech, sometimes the simplest solutions are the best.  Anyone else encounter a digital phantom lately?
