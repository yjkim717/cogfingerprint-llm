The curious case of Baby acquisition and Altacrest Capital. As I was digging through some product links, I stumbled upon a redirect that caught my eye. It seemed that some URLs were being rerouted through a CDN (Content Delivery Network), and my curiosity was piqued. Was this just a routine optimization technique, or was something more going on? 

As I dug deeper, I started to speculate about a potential connection between Altacrest Capital and the acquisition of Baby (you might know them as BBYY). Could it be that Altacrest was involved in the deal, and this redirect was a subtle hint? The plot thickened when I noticed that some product links were being tagged with "big dot" parameters. Was this some sort of tracking code? While it's all speculation at this point, it's fascinating to think about the behind-the-scenes machinations that might be at play. As someone who's always looking for the next big story, I'm keeping a close eye on this one.
