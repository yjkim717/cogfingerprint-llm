Ever find yourself wrestling with Elixir pipes, trying to force a function into the right spot with &-notation? I’ve been there—staring at multi-parametric functions, wondering if all that wrapping is truly idiomatic or just a clever hack. In 2023, as our codebases grow, clarity matters more than ever. Maybe there’s a cleaner path, one where argument-position finesse feels natural, not forced. It’s like tidying a cluttered desk: when everything flows smoothly, you can focus on building something meaningful, not just making it work. Let’s explore how to keep our Elixir elegant and our minds at ease.
