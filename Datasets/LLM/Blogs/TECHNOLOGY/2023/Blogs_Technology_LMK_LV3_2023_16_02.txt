In Baldur's Gate 3, I've often found myself pondering whether investing in lockpicking skills is truly worth it. As a rogue character, the temptation to bypass locked doors and chests is strong. However, I've discovered that sometimes the game's clever design offers alternative solutions, making lockpicking more of a luxury than a necessity. This got me thinking - in our own lives, do we often prioritize skills that aren't always essential, but still enrich our experiences?
