## Feeling a Little More Secure (and a Lot More Watched)

It’s 2023, and I'm officially joining the ranks of the security-conscious. After a few too many neighborhood news stories, I'm looking into home security systems. Specifically, outdoor cameras – the thought of having an extra set of eyes on the property is surprisingly comforting. It's a strange feeling, balancing peace of mind with the awareness of constant monitoring. Any recommendations welcome!
