As I dived back into Idleon this morning, I found myself pondering the intricacies of alchemy. With so many boosts and stamps available, it's easy to get lost in the sea of options. I'm not alone in wondering what's worth prioritizing - should I focus on '2x Brew' or another upgrade? In 2023, even our gaming habits are data-driven. I've been scouring forums and guides, trying to optimize my gameplay. But sometimes, it's refreshing to take a step back and just enjoy the idle fun.
