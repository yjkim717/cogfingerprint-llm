Remember when we thought smart homes would be all flying cars and robot butlers? In 2023, my biggest tech triumph is far more humble: my smart plug finally synced with the sunrise.

For years, it was a jumble of apps and forgotten passwords. I’d fumble for my phone, bleary-eyed, just to turn on a lamp. But this week, a simple software update made it all… seamless. The gentle light now just *appears*, as if the room itself is waking up.

It’s a small thing, but it’s the quiet, reliable technology that truly weaves into our lives. Not the flashy promises, but the subtle magic that works so well, you almost forget it’s there. And that, I’ve learned, is the real future.
