As I sat scrolling through my feeds, I couldn't help but feel a sense of digital dread wash over me. The constant stream of updates, the curated highlight reels, and the endless notifications had me anxious about the state of my online presence. It was as if I was preparing for a digital "surgery" - a procedure to optimize my online self for the world to see. But what if I wasn't ready to confront my digital mortality? What if my online identity was taken away in an instant? The thought sent a shiver down my spine. As I navigated this digital health issue, I realized that coping with the pressures of technology requires a new kind of self-care. By setting boundaries, practicing digital detox, and focusing on real-life connections, I was able to regain control and find a healthier balance in my online life.
