## The Ghosts in My Smart Home

It’s weird, isn’t it? How quickly we surrender our lives to algorithms. I realized it this week, staring at my thermostat. I’d spent a good fifteen minutes arguing with it, trying to nudge the temperature up a degree. It *knew* I was cold, it had data on my habits, but still… it resisted. 

This isn't a rant about technology, not really. It’s more of a quiet observation. I remember a time when comfort was a manual thing. A blanket, a sweater, a physical adjustment. Now, it’s a negotiation with a machine learning model.

And it’s not just the thermostat. My music recommendations are eerily accurate, anticipating my moods before I even consciously recognize them. My newsfeed feels curated by a ghost who knows my anxieties. It's convenient, undeniably. But sometimes, I miss the serendipity of stumbling across something unexpected.

I wonder if we're slowly losing our ability to *discover* things, to be surprised. Are we building these incredibly efficient, personalized worlds, only to find ourselves feeling a little… smaller within them? Maybe I’ll turn the thermostat off and light a candle tonight. A little analog rebellion feels… good.
