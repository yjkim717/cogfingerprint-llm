As a frontend developer in 2023, I've noticed a clear divide in company cultures based on their tech stack. Companies embracing TypeScript tend to have a more structured and scalable approach to development, reflecting a culture that values precision and long-term maintainability. In contrast, those using more flexible, albeit less strict, technologies often prioritize rapid iteration and innovation. My job search has led me to prefer companies with a TypeScript-centric approach, where I can grow alongside a team that shares my appreciation for robust, well-crafted code.
