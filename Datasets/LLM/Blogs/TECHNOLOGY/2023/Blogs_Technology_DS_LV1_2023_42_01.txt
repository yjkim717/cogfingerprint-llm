It’s 2023, and I’m still hunting for that perfect budget laptop. I tried the Lenovo Duet, but the kickstand just wasn’t for me. My old Asus Vivobook has the hinge I crave, but its screen is a letdown. Now I’m eyeing ChromeOS Flex as a potential savior—breathing new life into aging hardware. It’s funny how the simplest feature, a sturdy hinge, can feel like such a luxury in a sea of compromises.
