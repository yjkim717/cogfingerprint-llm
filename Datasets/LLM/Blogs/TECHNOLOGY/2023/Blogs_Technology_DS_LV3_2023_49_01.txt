The glow of my laptop screen is the only light in my Bogotá apartment at 2 AM. In 2023, you’d think everything would be seamless, but here I am, trapped in a digital limbo. I’m trying to navigate the labyrinth of the Colombian visa portal, my future hinging on a series of online forms and digital uploads.

My tourist stamp expires soon, and the fear isn't just about overstaying; it’s the terrifying prospect of an "entry denial" flag in some database, barring me from returning to my girlfriend and the life we’re building. All our plans—family birthdays, holiday traditions—could vanish with a single automated rejection email. Technology connects the world, yet it holds the power to build these invisible, impassable walls. Every click of the "submit" button feels like a roll of the dice, my heart in my throat, hoping the algorithm grants me a little more time for love.
