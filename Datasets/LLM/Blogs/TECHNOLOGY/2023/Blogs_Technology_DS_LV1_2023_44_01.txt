Of course. Here is an original text inspired by the medical summary.

My gastroenterologist was clear: a hiatal hernia doesn't just get better on its own. It's a structural issue, a one-way street. So, when my chronic heartburn and that persistent sore throat finally drove me to a follow-up endoscopy, we were both stunned. The screen clearly showed my 4cm hernia had shrunk to just 2cm. All those months on omeprazole, dietary changes, and mindful eating hadn't just managed the symptoms—they seemed to have created an environment where my body could partially heal. It's a powerful reminder that while medical dogma is built on general rules, our individual bodies can sometimes write their own surprising exceptions.

Here is a reflective blog post about technology for 2023.

It’s funny how a year can change your perspective. In 2023, I decided to go on a "tech diet," muting notifications and carving out screen-free hours. I expected to feel disconnected, but the opposite happened. Instead of doomscrolling through global chaos on Twitter, I found myself actually calling a friend to hear their voice. The AI tools that felt so futuristic became my quiet assistants for drafting emails, not my masters. This year taught me that the most powerful tech isn't the smartest algorithm, but the intentional space we create by occasionally turning it off. Connection, it turns out, was waiting in the silence all along.
