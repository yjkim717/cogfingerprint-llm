## The Alchemy of Idle Progress (and My World 3 Woes)

Okay, fellow Idleon players, let's talk boosting. I'm currently staring down World 3 and feeling… sluggish. It’s a familiar feeling, really – that moment where progress feels painstakingly slow. I’m wrestling with which Alchemy boosts to prioritize: Speed or Cost reduction? Speed feels tempting, but is pouring resources into it the *right* move? And what *exactly* does that 2x Brew do? Anyone else feeling this optimization paralysis? Sharing your wisdom is seriously appreciated – because right now, I just need a little boost to keep going!
