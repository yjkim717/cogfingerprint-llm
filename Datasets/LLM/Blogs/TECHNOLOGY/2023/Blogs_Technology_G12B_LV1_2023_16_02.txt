>## The Allure of the Unlocked Door (and Why I Might Not Bother)

Okay, so I've been diving deep into Baldur's Gate 3's early access, and something's been nagging at me. It's lockpicking. Specifically, *should* I be pouring points into it? 

The "Sleigh of Hands" ability is tempting, sure. That promise of higher success rates is shiny. But as someone who likes to optimize, I'm wrestling with opportunity cost. Every point spent on Thievery feels like a point *not* spent on, say, devastating spells or a critical-hit boosting build.

And honestly, the rewards haven't always felt worth the effort. A slightly better sword? A few extra potions? Sometimes it feels like I'm just adding another layer of complexity without a huge payoff. Maybe once the full game drops and the loot tables are fleshed out, Iâ€™ll change my mind. For now, I'm leaning towards leaving the locks to chance. What about you?
