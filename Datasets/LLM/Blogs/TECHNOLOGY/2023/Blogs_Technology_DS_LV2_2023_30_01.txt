Remember when we thought smart homes would simplify everything? In 2023, my fridge can order milk, but I still can’t get it to sync with my grocery list app without a 45-minute troubleshooting session. We’ve traded one set of chores for another—digital ones. Sometimes I miss my dumb appliances that just… worked. Technology promised connection, yet here I am, yelling at a voice assistant instead of calling a friend. Progress feels like two steps forward, one awkward tech support chat back.
