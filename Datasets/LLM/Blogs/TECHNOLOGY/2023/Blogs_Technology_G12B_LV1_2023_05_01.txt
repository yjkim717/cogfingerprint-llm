## The Final Polish: When Does "Done" Really Mean Done?

It's funny how much anxiety a seemingly simple phrase can generate: "Camera Ready." I just finished a deep dive into machine learning research, submitting a paper, and now I'm staring down the barrel of that final stage. It got me thinking – how much tweaking *is* allowed? Do I sneak in a few extra graphs? Rephrase a key argument? 

It's a surprisingly relatable feeling, isn't it? We're constantly chasing that perfect version, whether it's a research paper, a website design, or even a social media post. In 2023, with AI tools promising effortless refinement, the pressure to optimize *everything* feels amplified. 

But maybe "done" isn't about hitting some arbitrary perfection threshold. Maybe it's about knowing when you’ve said what you needed to say, and letting go. It's a lesson I’m trying to apply not just to my work, but to life itself. Less striving, more simply… releasing.
