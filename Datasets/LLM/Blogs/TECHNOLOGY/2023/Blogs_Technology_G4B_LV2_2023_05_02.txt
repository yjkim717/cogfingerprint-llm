**The Waiting Game (and the Internet)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We live in an age where we can order almost anything with a tap, instantly connect with people across the globe, and access pretty much any information we need in seconds. Yet, sometimes, the most frustrating things still involve… waiting. 

I’ve been wrestling with a visa application lately – a J1 visa for a program in Canada – and it’s brought up a really interesting thought. The process feels so archaic, so reliant on physical appointments and bureaucratic timelines.  I found myself obsessively researching which consulate offered an “expedited appointment,” a tiny sliver of digital hope in a sea of paperwork. 

It’s a reminder that while technology promised to make everything faster, sometimes the human element – and the slow pace of systems – still reigns supreme.  Anyone else feel this digital frustration lately?
