**The Unblinking Eye of Zoom**

Starting this new corporate gig in 2023, I was cautiously optimistic. They had a "safe space" disability group, and as someone with Asperger's, I decided to log on to the Zoom call. It felt like a genuine connection, a place to be real about the sensory overload of open-plan offices.

Then I saw it. The small, red recording dot. An unblinking eye capturing every shared vulnerability.

Suddenly, this digital haven felt like a corporate archive. Is a recorded conversation ever truly safe? Technology promised us community, but this felt like a performance for an unseen audience. Itâ€™s the modern paradox: the very tools designed to bring us together can, with one click, build a wall of hesitation. I left the meeting wondering what "safe" even means anymore.
