**The Sweet Spot (and a Little Tech Frustration)**

Okay, real talk – this year, I’ve been on a serious keto kick. It’s surprisingly demanding, and honestly, finding the right sweeteners feels like a constant quest. I stumbled upon Assugrin, a powdered keto sweetener, and the specs *looked* perfect – similar carb count to sugar, a density that promised good baking results.

But then came the challenge. Assugrin comes in tablets, and let me tell you, trying to crush those into a fine powder for cookies was a mini-battle with a mortar and pestle! It felt… inefficient.  It made me think about how we rely on tech to simplify our lives, but sometimes the “solution” just adds another step. 

I’m still searching for the ideal powdered sweetener, and maybe, just maybe, a gadget that automatically grinds it for me is in my future.  Anyone else feel this tech-meets-kitchen frustration?
