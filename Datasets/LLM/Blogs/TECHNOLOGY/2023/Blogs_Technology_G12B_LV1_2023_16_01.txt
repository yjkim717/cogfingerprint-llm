>## The Mind Flayer's Bargain: Tech and the Allure of Power

There's something captivating about playing an "evil" character in Baldur's Gate 3, especially one wielding Illithid powers - mind control, psychic blasts, the whole unsettling package. It got me thinking about our relationship with technology. We chase efficiency, power, and control, often without fully grasping the potential consequences. 

Just like those Mind Flayers, we might gain incredible abilities – instant information, hyper-connectivity – but at what cost? Do we lose something of ourselves in the pursuit of optimized living? It’s a question I've been wrestling with lately, scrolling through endless feeds, wondering if I’m being controlled more than I’m controlling. Maybe a little digital detox is in order.
