### The Digital Ghost Town: When Your Career Gets Blacklisted by an Algorithm

It’s a strange feeling, being paid to do nothing. For the last year, my corporate login has worked perfectly. The paycheck hits my account every other Friday like clockwork. But my project dashboard? A pristine, empty wasteland. My team chat? A digital ghost town where my "Hello, anyone there?" messages echo into the void.

It all started after I flagged a critical issue with our new AI-driven HR platform. The system was using biased data, unfairly penalizing employees in certain roles. I wasn't shouting from the rooftops; I filed a formal, data-backed report through the proper channels. The response wasn't anger or dismissal. It was silence.

I was swiftly "unassigned" from my projects for a "strategic review." That was twelve months ago. At first, I thought it was temporary. But then I noticed the job postings. My company is hiring for my exact role, in my exact department. My applications, however, vanish into a black hole. No rejection email, no confirmation of receipt. It’s as if I don’t exist in the system anymore.

I’ve become a ghost in the machine, a costly line item on a spreadsheet. I’m convinced an algorithm has quietly blacklisted me. In 2023, you don't need a manager to sideline you; you just need a flawed piece of code and a system designed for efficiency over ethics. The harassment isn't a raised voice in a hallway; it's the silent, automated erasure of your professional value. I have financial stability, but I'm trapped in a gilded cage, watching my skills atrophy while the digital world I helped build systematically excludes me. It’s a chillingly modern form of exile.
