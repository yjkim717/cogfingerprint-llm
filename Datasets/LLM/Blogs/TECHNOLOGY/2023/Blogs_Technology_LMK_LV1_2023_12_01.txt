"As I dove into refactoring my Elixir API in 2023, I realized my Ecto changesets were getting unwieldy. I was juggling validation functions and schema updates in a single, messy file. It was time to modularize! I started breaking out validation logic into separate modules, making my code more maintainable and reusable. By doing so, I simplified my changesets and made my API more scalable - a win-win for my sanity and my users."
