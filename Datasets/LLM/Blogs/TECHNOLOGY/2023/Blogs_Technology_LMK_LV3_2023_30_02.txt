Pursuing a graduate degree in tech can be a game-changer, but the cost can be daunting. I was thrilled to discover Cornell Tech's CS ME program, which offers a full scholarship to talented individuals. As someone on an H1B visa, I was unsure if I'd be eligible, but Cornell Tech's inclusive approach put my mind at ease. With a full scholarship, I can focus on advancing my skills and driving innovation. For those considering a tech career, I highly recommend exploring Cornell Tech's CS ME program - it could be your pathway to success.
