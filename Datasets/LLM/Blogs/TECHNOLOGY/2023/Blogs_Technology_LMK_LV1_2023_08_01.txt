Navigating the Tech World with Autism: A Personal Struggle

As a software engineer on the autism spectrum, I've often found myself struggling to cope with the sensory demands of my job. In 2023, I'm grateful to be working in a field that values innovation and inclusivity. But, despite the progress made, I still face challenges that my neurotypical colleagues take for granted. One of the most significant hurdles I've encountered is the constant background noise in our open-plan office. That's why I was thrilled to discover noise-cancelling headphones - a game-changer for my productivity and mental well-being. However, getting my employer to approve the purchase as a disability accommodation was a bureaucratic battle. I'm sharing my story to highlight the importance of accessibility in the tech industry. By sharing our experiences, we can create a more inclusive and supportive work environment for everyone.
