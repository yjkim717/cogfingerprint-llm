"The Frustration of Online Dating: A Call for Simplicity. As I swiped through yet another dating app in 2023, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with the cat-and-mouse game of online connections. The thrill of a match quickly turns to anxiety as you wait for the other person to reveal their identity. Ghosting is a familiar foe, leaving you wondering if you've been rejected or simply ignored. I'm not alone in wishing for a more straightforward approach. That's why I'm on the hunt for a dating website that allows simultaneous identity reveal, ditching anonymous profiles and getting to the heart of a real connection."
