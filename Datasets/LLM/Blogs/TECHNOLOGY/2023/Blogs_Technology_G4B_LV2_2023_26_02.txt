**Echoes of a Forgotten Build**

There’s something strangely comforting about looking back at old tech. I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day – a guy selling a whole mini-ITX PC build from 2014! An Intel i7, DDR3 memory, a trusty motherboard… it felt like stepping back in time. 

It reminded me of *my* first serious PC, painstakingly assembled years ago. Simple, maybe a little clunky by today’s standards, but it was *mine*.  These forgotten bundles hold a little piece of our digital journeys, don't they? #retrocomputing #pcbuilds
