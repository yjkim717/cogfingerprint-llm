**The Butterflies of a First Summer Internship**

It’s 2023, and I’m staring down the barrel of my first real tech experience – a summer internship at a startup. As a CS freshman, the thought of diving into a new codebase, let alone a whole company, feels…intense. I’m spending a lot of time scrolling, researching, and honestly, feeling a bit overwhelmed. Python and Java suddenly feel less like theoretical concepts and more like keys to unlocking something bigger.  I'm hoping this summer will be a crash course in not just coding, but also navigating the wild world of startups and figuring out where my skills fit in. Wish me luck!
