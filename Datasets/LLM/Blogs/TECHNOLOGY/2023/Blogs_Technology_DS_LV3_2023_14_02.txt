There I was, deep into 2023, wrestling with Kohya's SS Gui to train a custom SDXL Lora. I'd spent hours tweaking settings, hoping for that perfect character render. But my results were a frustrating cycle of either a blurry, undertrained mess or an overtrained, oversaturated nightmare. Each failed attempt meant another day lost to the grueling training process.

It’s in these moments you realize the true challenge of AI art isn't just the tech—it's the patience. You're essentially teaching a digital brain to see what you see, and sometimes it just doesn't get it. So, I’m turning to you all. Has anyone else cracked the code for consistent, high-quality Loras? I could really use some advice from those who’ve walked this rocky path before me.
