**The Blue Light Blues & My Sleep Search**

It’s funny how technology, designed to connect us, can sometimes feel like it’s actively pulling us *away* from things we really need – like a good night’s sleep. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over light, specifically the insidious blue light radiating from my phone and laptop. 

I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day where someone was desperately hunting for blackout curtains – a simple solution, really, but highlighting a very real struggle. It made me think about my own nightly battles. I’ve tried everything: blue light filters, apps, even eye masks. But nothing truly competes with a room completely shielded from artificial light. 

I’m currently researching custom-made options, imagining a dark haven just for sleep. It’s a small step, but maybe, just maybe, a little darkness is exactly what my 2023 brain needs to finally switch off and truly rest.  Anyone else battling the digital glow?
