**The Endless Scroll & the Feeling of…Nothing?**

It’s 2023, and I’m constantly battling the pull of my phone. Seriously, it’s like a digital black hole. Just yesterday, I was researching a J1 visa – the whole process feels so complicated, pinning your hopes on a consulate appointment. It made me think about how much of our lives are spent navigating systems, waiting for approvals. 

And then I realized, I’d spent an hour scrolling through Instagram, feeling…nothing. Just a vague sense of unease. We’re building incredible tech, connecting globally, but are we *really* connecting with ourselves?  Maybe it’s time to step away from the endless scroll and find a little stillness.  Anyone else feeling this digital fatigue?
