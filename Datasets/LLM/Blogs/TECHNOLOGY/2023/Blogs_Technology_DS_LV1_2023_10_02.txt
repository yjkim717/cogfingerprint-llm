### Rethinking the Rules: What Can You *Really* Afford for a Mortgage?

We’ve all heard the old rules of thumb—spend no more than 28% of your gross income on housing. But in today's economic climate, that feels increasingly disconnected from reality. Gross income doesn't pay the bills; your net income does.

Before you even look at mortgage calculators, you need a brutally honest budget. What are your true monthly expenses after you’ve paid for groceries, utilities, and your morning coffee? Now, factor in the hidden costs of homeownership: property tax, insurance, and inevitable maintenance.

So, what’s the right percentage of your *net* income for a mortgage payment? There is no magic number. It’s the amount that lets you pay your housing costs comfortably while still living your life and saving for your future. The best rule is the one that lets you sleep soundly at night, not the one from a decades-old textbook.

And here is a reflective blog post on technology for 2023.

It’s 2023, and my phone just delivered a notification: "You averaged 3 hours of screen time this week." I felt a surge of pride. Last year, that number was closer to six. This small victory made me reflect.

My journey started with digital burnout. My world was a constant stream of pings and scrolls. So, I decided to fight back. I turned off all non-essential notifications, relegated social media apps to a hidden folder, and bought an old-fashioned alarm clock to break the "phone-as-first-thing-I-see" habit.

The silence was unnerving at first. But soon, the mental space it created was profound. I started reading actual books again and having uninterrupted conversations. Technology is a fantastic tool, but this year, I finally learned that I am the one who should be wielding it, not the other way around.
