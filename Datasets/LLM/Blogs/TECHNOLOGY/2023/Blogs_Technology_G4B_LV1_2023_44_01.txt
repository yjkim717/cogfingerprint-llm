**The Shrinking Screen & My Gut**

It’s weird, right? I’ve spent the last few years obsessed with optimizing everything through tech – productivity apps, sleep trackers, even my grocery list. Then, a few months ago, I started getting this awful heartburn. Turns out, I have a pretty significant hiatus hernia. 

It really made me think about how we’re constantly chasing efficiency, often ignoring the signals our bodies are sending. Like, I was glued to my phone, stressed about deadlines, and completely neglecting my diet.  It’s a similar feeling to the way those early tech booms made us feel like we needed *more*, more data, more connections. 

My doctor suggested a simple change – omeprazole – and a focus on slowing down. It’s a tiny, almost analog solution to a complex problem.  Maybe we need to apply that same mindful approach to our digital lives too.
