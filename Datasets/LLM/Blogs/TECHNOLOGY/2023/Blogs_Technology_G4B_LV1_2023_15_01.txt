**The Blue Light Blues & My New Fortress**

Okay, 2023 has been… a lot. Endless scrolling, notifications pinging, the whole digital shebang. Honestly, it’s been wreaking havoc on my sleep. I’d lie awake, staring at my phone, fighting the urge to just *check* one more thing. 

So, I took drastic action. I invested in some seriously dark blackout curtains. It feels a little ridiculous, like building a fortress against the internet, but it’s actually working!
