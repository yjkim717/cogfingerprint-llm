It’s funny—just last week, I sold my old i7-6700 and mini-ITX setup on a hardware swap forum. In 2023, it’s easy to forget that these trusty components once powered so many late nights and creative projects. Letting go felt like closing a chapter, but knowing they’ll breathe life into someone else’s build? That’s the real joy of tech—it’s always part of a bigger story.
