"Simplifying Active Directory Group Management with PowerShell"

As I sat sipping my morning coffee in 2023, I found myself wrestling with a familiar problem - managing Active Directory group memberships. I needed to identify and export members of groups whose names matched a specific string, a task that seemed daunting at first. After some digging, I turned to PowerShell, my trusty ally in IT automation. I crafted a script that performed a recursive lookup, traversing nested groups to fetch all members. The result was a neat CSV file containing the desired information. The experience was a great reminder of the power of PowerShell in simplifying complex tasks. With just a few lines of code, I was able to streamline a process that would have otherwise taken hours. If you're struggling with a similar task, I'd be happy to share my script and insights.
