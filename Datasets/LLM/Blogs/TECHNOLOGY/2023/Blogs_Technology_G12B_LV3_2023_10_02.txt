## Is Your Phone Bill Really "Just" a Bill? A 2023 Reality Check

Remember when we used to marvel at how affordable phone calls were? Now, in 2023, our phones are pocket-sized computers, and those monthly bills… well, they’re a *lot* more than just calls. 

I was reading a discussion online the other day about mortgages, and it got me thinking. We often look at expenses in isolation. But what if we started considering the *total* cost? Our data plans, subscriptions tied to our devices, even the electricity they consume – it all adds up! Are we truly accounting for the financial strain of our tech reliance when budgeting? Maybe it's time for a digital financial check-up.
