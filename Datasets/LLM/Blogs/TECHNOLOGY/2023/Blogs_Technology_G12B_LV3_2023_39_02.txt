>## The Quest for Sound, and a Little Less Clutter

My living room is… cozy. Let’s just say space is at a premium. For years, my Logitech Z906 system has been my audio companion, a reliable workhorse. But I’m itching for a serious upgrade – a richer, deeper surround sound experience. The problem? My current setup involves a tangle of wires and a hefty AV receiver taking up valuable real estate.

So, I've been diving deep into the world of active subwoofers. The ones with built-in amplifiers and, ideally, some AV receiver smarts. It’s a 2023 dream: powerful, immersive sound *without* the clutter. Wish me luck in the search!
