There’s something quietly exciting happening in the Python web framework space, and I can’t help but feel a little nostalgic watching it unfold. I remember when Starlite first appeared—a capable, modern alternative in a world of familiar giants. Now, as we move through 2023, it’s stepping into a new era with a fresh logo, a new domain, and the highly anticipated v2.0 release on the horizon.

What really resonates with me is the direction they’re taking. It’s not just about new features; it’s about building something robust and lasting. With native SQL Alchemy 2.0 support, they’re future-proofing data layers for developers like us who crave both power and elegance. And the embrace of HTMX? It feels like a thoughtful nod back to simpler web development, but with all the modern ASGI performance we’ve come to rely on.

Adopting strict Semver is the kind of grown-up promise that makes you trust a project. It says, "We’re here to stay, and we care about your upgrade path." To me, this isn't just another update—it feels like Starlite is maturing into a foundational tool, one that balances cutting-edge speed with thoughtful, sustainable design. It’s a journey I’m genuinely happy to be following.
