Staring at Cornell Tech’s CS ME program page, I felt a familiar pull. The curriculum is brilliant, no doubt. But as an H1B hopeful in 2023, the math is sobering. The tuition cost is staggering, and the post-grad ROI feels murkier than ever. Is this degree the golden ticket it promises to be, or just a very expensive gamble? I’m left wondering if any full-ride scholarships exist for dreamers like me, caught between ambition and the harsh reality of price tags. The search continues.
