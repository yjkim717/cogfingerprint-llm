## The Upgrade That Had Me Questioning Reality (and VMware Licenses!)

Okay, let's be honest, who *doesn't* have a tech upgrade story that goes sideways? I recently had one that left me scratching my head, muttering to myself, and seriously questioning if my servers were playing some kind of elaborate prank. 

We’re deep into 2023, and the push to vSphere 8 has been in full swing. So, naturally, we took the plunge, upgrading our vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) and our ESXi hosts. Everything *seemed* to go smoothly initially. The upgrade wizard didn't throw any red flags, the servers rebooted, and I was feeling pretty good about being a proactive IT admin.

Then came the licensing. 

One of our hosts, despite *clearly* displaying vSphere 8 in its system information, stubbornly insisted it was still running vSphere 7. This, as you can imagine, caused a delightful conflict when trying to assign our vSphere 8 license. I checked everything – versions, configurations, the manual – you name it. Nothing. It was like the server was living in a different dimension.

After a good amount of head-scratching and a few frantic searches through VMware documentation, I stumbled upon a suggestion: temporarily switch to an evaluation license. And, unbelievably, it worked! After a brief stint running on an evaluation, the host magically recognized the vSphere 8 license. 

It was a bizarre, slightly unsettling experience. It really highlights how even seemingly straightforward upgrades can throw curveballs. It's a reminder that in the world of virtualization, sometimes you just have to take a step back, try something unexpected, and hope for the best. Anyone else had a similar licensing hiccup? Let me know in the comments – misery loves company, right?
