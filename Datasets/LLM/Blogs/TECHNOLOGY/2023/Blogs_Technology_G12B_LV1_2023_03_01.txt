## The Algorithm Knows My Ex Better Than I Do (And That's Kind of Weird)

Okay, let's be real. How many of us have fallen down the rabbit hole of ex-stalking – I mean, *researching* – on social media? I know I have. And in 2023, with the sheer level of data we’re all generating, it's gotten… different. It’s not just seeing a picture from a party anymore. It’s a meticulously curated timeline of their *life*, tailored by algorithms to show you exactly what they want you (or, more likely, their next potential partner) to see.

I recently went through a breakup – amicable, mostly – with Liam. We were together for about two years, and it was a good run. But we wanted different things, you know? And after the initial sadness subsided, I found myself… intrigued. Not in a *get-him-back* way, thankfully. More in a… *what is he even doing with his life now?* kind of way.

So, naturally, I started lurking. (Don't judge!)

And what I found was… unsettling. His Instagram, which had been fairly low-key during our relationship, was suddenly brimming with pictures of him rock climbing, volunteering at an animal shelter, and attending obscure art exhibitions. All things he *never* mentioned while we were together. Like, zero. He’s always been a homebody!

Then came the comments. Lots of them. Mostly from women I’d never seen before, gushing about his adventurous spirit and "vibe."  It was... a lot.

It got me thinking. We live in an age where we're constantly presenting a carefully crafted version of ourselves online. And algorithms are working overtime to refine that presentation to attract a specific audience. Is Liam’s Instagram now a calculated attempt to attract a *different* kind of partner? Someone who appreciates the things he apparently never felt the need to share with me?

It’s a weirdly impersonal feeling, isn’t it? To realize that an algorithm, built on data points and engagement metrics, somehow understands what someone is looking for in a relationship better than you did. It feels like it highlights the inherent performativity of modern dating. We’re all playing roles to some extent, tweaking our profiles, curating our feeds, hoping to resonate with the right person. 

And it makes you wonder: how much of what we *think* we know about someone is genuine, and how much is just a carefully constructed digital facade? It's a reminder that even in the age of hyper-connectivity, true connection remains a surprisingly elusive thing. I'm trying to focus on my own life, my own curated feed (though maybe with slightly less intense hiking photos!), and trust that whatever comes next will be… authentically me. And hopefully, authentically them too.
