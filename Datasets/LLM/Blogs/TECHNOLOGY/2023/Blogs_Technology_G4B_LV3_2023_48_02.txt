**The Weight of Types: A Frontend Developer’s Doubt**

It’s 2023, and honestly, sometimes staring at a job board feels a little… overwhelming. I keep seeing “TypeScript” everywhere – the default, the expectation. And I find myself wondering, are we building walls around our code, or just making it more complicated? 

I’ve always gravitated towards lighter frameworks like Vue. There’s something incredibly satisfying about its simplicity, its ability to let you build quickly and intuitively. Lately, though, I’ve been wrestling with this idea of "dynamic types" in UI development. Do we *really* need to declare everything upfront? 

It feels like a subtle shift – a move towards rigidness when fluidity and rapid iteration should be the goal. I’m not against TypeScript, not at all. But I’m questioning whether the added complexity is always worth it.  What’s *your* take on this balancing act between structure and freedom in the ever-evolving tech landscape?
