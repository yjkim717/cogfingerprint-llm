>## The Algorithm Knows I Missed My Flight (and Probably My Life?)

Okay, I need to vent. It started with a simple missed connection. A delayed flight in Miami meant I missed my flight to Medellín, Colombia. Annoying, right? But then the *real* weirdness began. 

Ever since that hiccup, my social media feed has been… aggressively Colombian. Not just coffee ads, either. I'm seeing articles about salsa dancing, travel blogs showcasing hidden waterfalls, even a targeted ad for a *quinceañera* dress shop. Seriously? 

It's unsettling. It feels like the algorithms have pieced together the fact that I was *supposed* to be in Colombia, and now they’re relentlessly reminding me. It’s almost mocking my missed opportunity. 

It makes you wonder, doesn’t it? How much do these systems *really* know? How much of our lives are predicted, categorized, and then subtly manipulated by lines of code? I was just hoping to extend my 90-day tourist visa, but now I’m questioning the very nature of digital existence. Maybe I should just go off-grid. Or learn to salsa. At least that’s a tangible escape.
