It’s moving day, and I’m staring at a blank wall where my router will live in my new apartment. I’ve been down this road before—the siren song of prosumer routers with enough blinking lights to guide an airplane, followed by the crushing reality of a complicated setup and a drained wallet. Not this time.

My only goal for 2023? Reliable, affordable Wi-Fi. I’d heard the horror stories about flaky ISP hardware, so I was determined to find a middle ground. I just wanted a connection that wouldn’t drop during a video call or buffer a movie. It felt like a simple ask, but in a world of tech overkill, it was surprisingly hard to find.

In the end, I found a solid, no-fuss router that works seamlessly with my Fios connection. No more obsessing over signal strength or rebooting daily. It just… works. And that quiet reliability has been the real upgrade, letting me focus on what actually matters in my new home. Sometimes, the best tech is the tech you don't have to think about.
