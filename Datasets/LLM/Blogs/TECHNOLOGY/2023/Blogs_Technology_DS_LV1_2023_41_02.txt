It’s 2023, and I’m stuck in a digital grind—my own version of World 3. I keep chasing upgrades: faster processors, smarter apps, all promising that "2x brew" speed boost. But like an alchemist obsessed with bubbles, I wonder—am I just boiling the same old potion? Every cost-efficient shortcut feels like another layer of complexity. Maybe the real magic isn’t in brewing faster, but in knowing when to step back and savor the process. Sometimes, progress means slowing down.
