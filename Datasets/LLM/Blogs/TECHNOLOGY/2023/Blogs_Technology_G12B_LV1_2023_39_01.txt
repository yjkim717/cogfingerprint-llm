>## Where Did My Tab Swiping Magic Go?

Okay, tech folks, let's talk Chrome extensions. Specifically, let's mourn the apparent vanishing act of 'Smooth Gestures Plus.' For ages, this little gem was my secret weapon for navigating a chaotic sea of browser tabs. A simple swipe left or right, and *poof*, I was where I needed to be. It felt almost…intuitive.

Then, seemingly overnight, it was gone from the Chrome Web Store. Just…gone. A little panic set in. It's a strange feeling, losing a digital habit you've grown accustomed to.

It’s a reminder that even the best tools in our digital lives aren’t guaranteed. The web is constantly shifting, extensions disappear, and suddenly you’re back to the drawing board, searching for a new way to wrangle those ever-increasing tabs. Anyone else experienced this? Any recommendations for good tab management extensions out there? I’m officially seeking replacements!
