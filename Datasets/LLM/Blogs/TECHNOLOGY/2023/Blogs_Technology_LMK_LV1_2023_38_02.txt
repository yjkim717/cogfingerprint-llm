As I sat down to prepare for my PhD interview in the neuroscience program, I couldn't help but wonder if I should email the professors I'd be meeting beforehand. Should I discuss my research interests and how they align with theirs? In today's digital age of 2023, it's easier than ever to connect with potential advisors, but is it the right move? I thought about my background in both neuroscience and engineering, and how the intersection of these two fields is where my true passion lies. I decided to take a chance and craft a brief, personalized email to each professor, highlighting the specific aspects of their work that resonated with me. To my surprise, it sparked a meaningful conversation and gave me valuable insight into their expectations. Whether or not it influenced the outcome, it helped me feel more confident and prepared for the interview.
