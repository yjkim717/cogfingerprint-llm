**The RAM Question: ZFS, RAIDZ1, and My Wallet’s Wailing**

So, I’ve been diving deep into ZFS for my little home lab, specifically setting up a RAIDZ1 array on Proxmox. It’s amazing, seriously – the data integrity is a huge relief. But… I’m staring down the barrel of a serious RAM question. 

Everyone keeps saying “at least 32GB,” but then I read articles about deduplication and how it *devours* memory.  I’m on a tight budget, and frankly, my bank account is starting to stage a protest.  Right now, I’m wrestling with whether to chase that supposed performance boost or just stick with what I can afford.  It’s a frustrating reminder that tech advice isn’t always gospel – you gotta do your own digging!
