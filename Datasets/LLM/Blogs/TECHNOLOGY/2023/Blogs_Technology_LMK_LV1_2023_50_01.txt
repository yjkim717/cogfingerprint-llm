As I jammed with Ableton Live Lite in 2023, I stumbled upon an intriguing challenge: tuning my beats to the mystical solfeggio frequencies. I wanted to experiment with the 528Hz frequency, believed to promote healing and positivity. Using Vital synth, I discovered that modifying MIDI note pitches was the key. By adjusting the pitch, I was able to match the desired frequency. It was a eureka moment, merging music production with ancient sound healing practices. Now, my tracks not only sound great but also aim to uplift and inspire listeners.
