It’s 2023, and I’m deep in an Elixir project, wrestling with a stubborn pipe chain. I kept wrapping functions in `&` just to nudge an argument into place, but something felt off—like forcing a puzzle piece. Was this truly idiomatic, or just a clever hack? I paused, reflecting on how often we bend code to our will instead of embracing its flow. Sometimes, the most elegant solutions aren’t about control, but harmony. And maybe, just maybe, there’s a simpler path waiting to be discovered.
