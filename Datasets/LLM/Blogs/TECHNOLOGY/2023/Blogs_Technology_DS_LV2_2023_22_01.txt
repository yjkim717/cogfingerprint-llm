Remember when VMware Horizon and Citrix felt like rivals in the EUC space? It’s funny how things shift. Now, with Broadcom’s moves and whispers of HPE stepping in, it’s like watching old friends and foes swap roles. I can’t help but reflect on how quickly the tech landscape reshapes itself—what’s competition today could be consolidation tomorrow. Makes you appreciate the constant dance of innovation and reinvention, doesn’t it? Just another reason why staying curious keeps us grounded in this ever-changing digital world.
