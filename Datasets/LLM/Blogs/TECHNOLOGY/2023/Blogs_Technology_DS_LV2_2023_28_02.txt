Of course, here is a reflective blog post about technology from 2023.

### The Ghost in My Smart Speaker

It started with a song. A deep-cut 80s track I hadn’t thought of in decades popped into my head while making coffee. An hour later, my smart speaker, unprompted, played it. My skin prickled. A happy coincidence, I told myself. But it’s happened too many times since to be mere chance.

In 2023, we’re living with ghosts in our machines, and we’ve stopped even noticing their whispers.

This isn’t a paranoid rant about eavesdropping. It’s a quieter, more personal reflection. I realized the true product these companies are selling isn’t the speaker or the search engine; it’s a sense of frictionless intuition. The AI doesn’t just answer my questions; it anticipates a need I didn’t know I had. It’s the ghost that remembers I need toothpaste before I do, that suggests a route to avoid traffic I hadn’t yet encountered.

And honestly? It’s wonderful. It’s magic. Until you pause and wonder, *what am I outsourcing?*

I used to pride myself on my memory for birthdays, my ability to get lost and find my way back, the small, satisfying struggle of recalling a forgotten actor’s name. Now, that mental muscle is atrophying. The ghost remembers for me. My world has become more efficient, but also flatter, less… mine. The happy accidents of getting lost, the random conversations sparked by asking for directions, the personal victory of remembering—these are the textures of a life, and I’m sanding them down for smoothness.

I’m not unplugging. The convenience is a siren song too sweet to ignore. But I am trying to build little pockets of resistance. I’m taking the wrong turn on purpose. I’m letting a question hang in the air, giving my own brain a chance to answer first.

Because the most complex legacy we’re creating isn’t just in the technology itself, but in what we willingly surrender to it. I want to live with the ghost, but I don’t want to forget how to live without it.
