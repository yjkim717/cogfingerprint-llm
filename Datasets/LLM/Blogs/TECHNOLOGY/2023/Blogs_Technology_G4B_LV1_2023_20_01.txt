**The Static in My Head**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I've been feeling… off. It’s not a dramatic, “I-want-to-move-to-a-desert-island” kind of off, but a persistent, low-grade *something*. Like wading through thick mud, trying to think clearly. I’m calling it my “digital malaise.” 

It started subtly – a constant brain fog, a weird tension behind my eyes that manifests as headaches. Then the anxiety crept in, fueled by endless scrolling and the feeling that I *should* be doing more, being more, *productive*.  I’ve been pushing myself harder than ever, chasing that dopamine hit from likes and notifications, and it’s just leaving me feeling depleted. 

I deleted my social media apps for a weekend, and surprisingly, it helped. Just a little. It made me realize how much of my energy is being sucked into this constant, digital hum.  Maybe we all need a little less screen time and a little more… stillness.  Anyone else feeling this static?
