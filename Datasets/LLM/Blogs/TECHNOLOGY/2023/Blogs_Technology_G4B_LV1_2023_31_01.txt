**Is Our Tech Really Making Time Go Faster?**

Okay, I’ve been diving down a rabbit hole lately, thinking about time – seriously! It started with a weird article about how physicists are trying to model time dilation using…compute budgets and object size. Sounds wild, right? 

It got me wondering about our everyday tech. We’re cramming insane processing power into smaller and smaller devices, and it feels like everything’s just *faster*.  Like, my phone anticipates what I want before I even type it. 

The article suggested that the ‘frame of reference’ – how fast something is moving – actually impacts how we perceive time, and that relates to how much “mass” something has. It’s a complex idea, but it made me think about how our increasingly powerful computers are essentially creating their own, super-fast frames of reference. 

Are we subtly warping our experience of time through the sheer speed of our digital world?  It’s a strange thought, but one that’s definitely got me pondering as we head into 2023!
