## Is "Safe Space" Just a Zoom Link Now?

Something’s been on my mind lately. My new corporate gig has a disability group, which is fantastic, right? But they held an event on Zoom, and it got me thinking. Is a recorded event *really* a safe space? I’m on the spectrum (Asperger’s), and the idea of truly opening up, of being vulnerable, felt…complicated.

It’s 2023, and we’re so reliant on technology to connect. But sometimes, I wonder if it’s creating a barrier instead. Are companies genuinely committed to neurodiversity, or is this just performative allyship? I'd love to hear your thoughts – does the digital world enhance or hinder genuine connection?
