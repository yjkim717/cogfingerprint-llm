## The Ghosts in My Digital Collection

It's funny, isn't it? How easily we accumulate digital ephemera. My phone’s photo roll is a sprawling, chronological mess – a visual timeline of meals, pets, and fleeting moments. It reminds me of those old gaming series, like Xenosaga, where the original vision was so much grander than what actually materialized. Takahashi initially planned six games!

Looking at my own digital hoard, I wonder what the "Episode 4," "Episode 5," and "Episode 6" of my online life will be. What experiences, what connections, will be lost to fragmented storage and shifting platforms? It’s a strange kind of digital archaeology, trying to piece together a narrative from scattered artifacts. Maybe someday, someone will sift through my cloud storage and try to understand *my* unfinished saga.
