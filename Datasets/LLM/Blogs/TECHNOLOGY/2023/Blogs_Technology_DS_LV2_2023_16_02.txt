Remember when we all thought smart homes would mean less clutter? My 2023 reality is five different apps just to control the lights. It feels a bit like my Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 rogue, endlessly fiddling with digital "locks" instead of a simple switch. We built these intricate systems of convenience, yet sometimes I miss the analog satisfaction of a physical key. The tech is brilliant, but it begs the question: are we over-engineering our lives in the quest to simplify them?
