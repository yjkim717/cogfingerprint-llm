**The Quest for Consistent Sweetness (and a Slightly Obsessive Algorithm)**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with a weird little obsession lately – finding the *perfect* baking sweetener. I’m tired of those powdered sugar substitutes that promise sweetness but deliver a wildly inconsistent experience. It’s like, one batch of cookies is divine, the next is… disappointing. 

I stumbled across Assugrin, and the density factor really grabbed me. It’s like, a solid, dependable sweetness. I started tracking my baking experiments with a ridiculously detailed spreadsheet – measuring everything from humidity to powder consistency.  Seriously, I even built a mini-algorithm to predict sweetness levels!  It’s a bit much, I know, but finding that reliable sweetness is surprisingly satisfying in this hyper-connected world.  Anyone else get this granular with their hobbies?
