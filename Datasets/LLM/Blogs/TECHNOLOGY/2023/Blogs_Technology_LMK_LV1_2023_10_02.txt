As I sat down to review my finances in 2023, I couldn't help but wonder if the old 30% gross income rule for mortgage payments still made sense. With rising property taxes and housing expenses, I felt like I was stretching my budget to the limit. But what really got me thinking was how my net income - not gross - was what actually hit my bank account each month. Isn't it time we started using a more nuanced metric, like net income, to determine affordable housing costs? By doing so, we could create more realistic and personalized financial plans.
