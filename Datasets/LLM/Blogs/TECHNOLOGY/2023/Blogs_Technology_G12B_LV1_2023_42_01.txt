>## The Unexpected Joy of a Simple Laptop (and ChromeOS Flex!)

I've been on a tech decluttering kick lately, and it's led me to a surprisingly satisfying realization: sometimes, less is more. I didn't need the latest, greatest, most-feature-packed machine. I just needed something *reliable* for basic tasks â€“ browsing, writing, the occasional video call.

So, I dove into the world of affordable laptops, specifically looking at options compatible with ChromeOS Flex. It's been amazing to breathe new life into an older Asus Vivobook L210! The simple hinge feels wonderfully familiar, a welcome change from the tablet-esque designs everywhere. Who knew rediscovering a traditional laptop could be so refreshing?
