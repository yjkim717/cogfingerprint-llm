**The Zoom Paradox**

I’ve been wrestling with something lately, and it feels surprisingly relevant to so many of us navigating the digital world. I recently got an invite to a corporate event focused on disability inclusion, hosted entirely via Zoom. And honestly? A little knot of anxiety tightened in my stomach. 

There’s something inherently…fragile about a screen, isn’t there? It feels like a *safe space* in some ways, but also like a carefully constructed performance. The idea of a recording felt particularly unsettling – did it really mean genuine support, or just a polished, documented effort? 

I have Asperger’s, and the pressure of feeling “seen” can be overwhelming. I anticipated a familiar disappointment, a feeling of being observed rather than truly understood. It’s a frustrating paradox: technology promises connection, yet can sometimes build walls instead. What are your thoughts on this?
