**The Horizon Shift**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching tech giants shift gears. I was reading about Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware Horizon EUC, and it got me thinking about how quickly things change.  Suddenly, the whispers are about HPE emerging as a frontrunner – a potential new owner for that familiar Horizon landscape. 

It reminds me of that feeling when your favorite old software gets bought out. There’s a little knot of uncertainty, a hope that the core value—the way it *works*—will be preserved.  Let’s hope whoever takes the reins understands that. What are your thoughts on this shift?
