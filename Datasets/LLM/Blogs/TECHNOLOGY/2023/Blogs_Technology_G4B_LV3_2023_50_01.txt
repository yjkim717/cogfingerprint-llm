It’s funny how technology can unexpectedly pull you into the deepest of rabbit holes. I was wrestling with Ableton Live Lite the other day, trying to coax a specific 528Hz frequency out of my Vital synth – a lush, enveloping pad sound I was building.  Suddenly, I was diving into MIDI pitch modification, and then…Solfeggio frequencies. 

It felt a bit strange, this blending of digital production with ancient sound healing. But honestly, it highlighted something: the way we’re constantly seeking resonance, whether through meticulously tweaked waveforms or the promise of frequencies believed to vibrate with our very being.  Isn’t that just a reflection of our human desire for harmony?
