It’s wild to think that in 2023, we trust so much of our digital lives to devices like my APC UPS, guarding everything from my work files to precious family photos. But after stumbling on a video revealing some units have transformers with aluminum cores poorly soldered to copper wiring, I’m pausing. That tiny flaw, hidden inside, could pose a real fire hazard. It’s a stark reminder: even the tech we rely on for safety isn’t immune to human error. Makes you wonder what else we’ve overlooked in the rush to stay connected and protected.
