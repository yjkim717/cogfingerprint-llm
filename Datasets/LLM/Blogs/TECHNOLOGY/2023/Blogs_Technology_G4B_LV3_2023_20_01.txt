**The Endless Scroll and the Missing Pieces**

Let’s be honest, 2023 feels… overwhelming, doesn’t it? We’re constantly connected, bombarded with information, and yet, sometimes it feels like we’re further from understanding ourselves than ever. I’ve been grappling with a frustrating kind of “brain fog” lately – a persistent feeling of being adrift, despite having access to *everything* online.

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re supposed to be smarter, more informed than previous generations thanks to technology. But when I’m battling symptoms that don’t fit a neat diagnosis, searching for answers online feels like wading through a sea of misinformation and anxiety. It mirrors the experience of feeling dismissed – like my struggles with chronic illness are being reduced to a simple Google search. 

I’m starting to realize that the constant scroll isn’t always leading to clarity. Sometimes, it just amplifies the feeling of being lost, and the desperate need for a real, human connection to help piece things together.
