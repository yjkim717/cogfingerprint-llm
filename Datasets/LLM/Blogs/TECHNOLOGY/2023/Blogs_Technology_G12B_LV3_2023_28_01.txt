## The Startup Summer Dream (and a Slightly Late Start!)

Okay, real talk. It's May 2023, and I'm a CS freshman staring down the barrel of summer. The dream? A startup internship. The reality? I kinda left the hunt a little late. ðŸ˜… 

But hey, that's not stopping me! I've been grinding with Python and Java, dabbling in some web development, and I'm genuinely excited to learn. I know I'm not the most experienced candidate out there, but Iâ€™m eager, a fast learner, and bursting with ideas. 

Anyone else ever felt like they started a little behind the curve? Itâ€™s definitely a reminder that the journey is just as important as the destination. Now, back to refreshing those job boards! Wish me luck! #startupinternship #csfreshman #python #java #summerinternship
