>## The Quiet Hum of Disconnection

Remember when "going offline" felt like a radical act? Back in 2013, it was a conscious decision, a digital detox. Now, in 2023, the hum of notifications feels almost… permanent. I caught myself the other day, reaching for my phone *before* even finishing a cup of coffee. 

It's not about the technology itself, of course. My phone’s a marvel. It's the constant pull, the curated realities, the fear of missing out. I’ve started intentionally carving out small pockets of disconnection – a walk without music, a dinner without scrolling. It’s surprisingly… peaceful. 

It's like rediscovering the world in sharper focus. Maybe radical isn't about ditching devices entirely, but about reclaiming ownership of our attention in a world vying for it. What small steps are *you* taking to find that quiet hum again?
