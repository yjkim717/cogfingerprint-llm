## The Algorithm and the Hesitation

It’s funny how much of our lives now feel like carefully crafted applications. Scrolling through LinkedIn, updating my resume, even crafting the perfect “About Me” for dating apps – it’s all about showcasing alignment, right? I was wrestling with this feeling recently while considering a new software project. The initial instinct was to bombard potential collaborators with detailed proposals, outlining every feature and expected outcome. A pre-emptive pitch, essentially.

But then I remembered something from a conversation I had last year – a researcher talking about PhD interviews and the pressure to demonstrate perfect research fit *before* even meeting. He ended up deciding to hold back, trusting the dynamic of a real conversation.

And it resonated. Maybe relentless pre-selling isn’t always the key. Maybe it’s better to enter a space with genuine curiosity, allowing the connection to unfold organically. It’s a less algorithmic approach, a bit riskier, but feels… more human.  2023 feels like a year where we desperately need a little more of that.
