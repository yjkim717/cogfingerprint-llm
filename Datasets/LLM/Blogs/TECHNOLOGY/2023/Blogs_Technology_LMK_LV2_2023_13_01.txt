"As I paddled down the Yukon River, I couldn't help but think about how far we've come - and how far we've strayed. In 2023, it's easy to get caught up in the digital whirlwind, but on this river trip, I rediscovered the joy of disconnecting. No cell service, no notifications, just the gentle lapping of the water against the canoe. It was a refreshing reminder that sometimes, the best technology is no technology at all."
