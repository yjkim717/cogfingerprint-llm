"When designing a programming language, it's tempting to take advice from fellow developers and industry experts. However, in 2023, we're reminded that their experiences are often shaped by unique contexts and challenges. Blindly following their lead can lead to misguided decisions. As language designers, it's crucial to consider the diverse needs of users and the ever-evolving landscape of software development. By doing so, we can create languages that are not only efficient but also adaptable and user-friendly, ultimately driving innovation in the tech industry."
