As a remote teacher in 2023, I’ve found that WeChat video calls are more than just chats—they’re my virtual classroom. Screen sharing lets me present lessons, but real-time document editing is the game-changer. Watching students annotate and collaborate live, I feel connected despite the distance. It’s not just tech; it’s a bridge to meaningful, interactive learning moments.
