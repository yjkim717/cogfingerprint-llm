## The Algorithm and the Unexpected Detour

It’s funny how reliant we’ve become on algorithms, isn’t it? In 2023, we trust them to suggest our next read, curate our newsfeeds, even plan our routes. But what happens when the system throws a curveball? 

Recently, a friend found themselves in a bit of a Colombian visa pickle – navigating extensions and the anxiety of potential overstays. It got me thinking about how we apply that same logic to life. We plan, we optimize, we assume a predictable path. But sometimes, life, like a glitching travel app, reroutes us in unexpected ways. 

It’s a reminder that while technology can be a powerful tool, it shouldn't dictate our entire journey. Embracing the detours, the uncertainties, might just lead to the most rewarding discoveries. Sometimes, stepping off the suggested route is exactly what we need.
