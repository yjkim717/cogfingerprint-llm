There’s something about moving into a new apartment that makes you reevaluate everything—especially your tech setup. When I cut the cord on my old ISP’s clunky, rental router last month, I felt a mix of freedom and mild panic. Sure, I’d escaped the dreaded monthly hardware fee, but now I was staring at a blank slate.

I dove headfirst into the world of prosumer routers, determined to build a home network that wouldn’t drop my video calls or buffer my shows. It felt like a rite of passage—choosing my own gear, configuring settings, and finally taking control. After a bit of trial and error (and one late-night firmware update), I landed on a setup that just… works.

Now, with a reliable access point humming quietly in the corner, my Wi-Fi is finally something I don’t have to think about. And honestly? That peace of mind is worth every penny. It’s 2023—our homes shouldn’t be held back by subpar hardware.
