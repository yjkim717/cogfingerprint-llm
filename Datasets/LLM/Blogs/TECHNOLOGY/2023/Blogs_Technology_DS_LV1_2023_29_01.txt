Remember that late-night hackathon in 2023, fueled by coffee and a wild idea for a new programming language? I was so sure my type inference system was genius. Then a well-meaning friend, a seasoned language designer, told me it was a dead end. "Too much cognitive load," he said, citing his own past failures.

I almost scrapped the whole project.

But then I remembered a piece of wisdom that saved me: treat advice like a single data point, not a universal law. His experience was real, but it was forged in a different context with different constraints. My language had different goals.

I pushed forward, adapting the concept instead of abandoning it. The lesson wasn't to ignore peers, but to filter their counsel through the unique lens of my own project. Sometimes, the best design emerges when you respectfully question the "expert" in the roomâ€”even if that expert is you, learning from a path no one else has walked.
