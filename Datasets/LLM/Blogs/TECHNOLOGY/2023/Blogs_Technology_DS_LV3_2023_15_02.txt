There we were, my friend and I, armed with our Furlcalling Finger Remedies and Duelist's Furled Finger signs, ready for some 2023 multiplayer action. We'd followed every guide, double-checked passwords, and yet... nothing. Our summon signs remained stubbornly invisible to each other. It's funny how in an age of seamless connectivity, two people can be in the same digital realm yet completely miss each other. Sometimes the most advanced technology still leaves us searching for that human connection we crave.
