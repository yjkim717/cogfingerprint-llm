### The Universe's Render Farm: A Thought Experiment

It was during a late-night gaming session, watching my character’s shadow flicker and fade to save processing power, that the wildest thought struck me. What if our reality has a compute budget, too?

I’ve been following the AI explosion in 2023, marveling at large language models and their astronomical energy demands. The more complex the model, the more computational power it eats. It got me thinking about the ultimate complex objects: things with mass.

This led me down a rabbit hole, back to Einstein’s time dilation. We accept that time slows for an object as it approaches light speed, or when it’s near a massive body like a black hole. The "why" has always been abstract, a feature of spacetime geometry. But what if it’s a feature of optimization?

Imagine our universe as an unfathomably advanced simulation. Every particle, every force, requires computation. Now, an object with more mass and a larger surface area is inherently more complex to simulate—it has more "things" to track and more interactions to calculate. When that object also moves at high speed, the computational load skyrockets; the system has to update its position and state across a vast frame of reference at an incredible rate.

So, what does a system do when faced with a resource-intensive task? It allocates more power to it, often at the expense of other processes. In this case, to handle the immense calculation of a fast-moving, massive object, the system might "slow down" its local timeline—its tick rate—to stay within the overall computational budget. The object isn’t experiencing a mysterious geometric effect; it’s literally being processed on a slower thread to prevent a system-wide lag.

It’s a humbling, almost whimsical idea. The majestic, immutable law of time dilation might not be a law at all, but simply evidence of a universal render farm, desperately trying to keep up. It makes you wonder what happens when the universe encounters a buffer overflow.
