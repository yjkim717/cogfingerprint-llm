The fog rolled in sometime last spring. It wasn't the weather; it was my brain. First came the crushing fatigue, a malaise that made getting out of bed feel like a marathon. Then, the strange sensationsâ€”pins and needles dancing across my skin for no reason.

I became a professional patient. My life was a revolving door of doctor's offices, vials of blood, and scans. Each time, the verdict was the same: "Your tests are all normal." The words felt like a dismissal, a confirmation that my suffering was all in my head. The frustration was a physical weight, heavier than the fatigue. How could I feel so broken when every machine and measurement declared me whole? I was lost in a medical labyrinth with no map, my body both the prison and the only evidence of a crime no one else could see. The search for a name, for validation, had become its own chronic illness.
