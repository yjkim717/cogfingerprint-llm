**The USB Drive Dilemma: A Backup Obsession**

Okay, confession time. I’ve officially entered a slightly frantic phase with my home lab. It started innocently enough – wanting a simple, offline backup system. The idea of a collection of USB drives, each holding a snapshot of my precious data, seemed… manageable.  Then Restic came along, and suddenly I was diving deep into `fstab` entries and the surprisingly complex world of drive recognition.

It’s proving trickier than I anticipated. I’m wrestling with the ‘multiple drives’ problem – will Restic reliably copy to *all* of them?  Do I need fancy scripts?  Is this whole thing destined to become a tangled mess of cables and frustration? 

Honestly, it’s a surprisingly emotional experience.  It’s not just about the tech; it’s about the peace of mind of knowing my work isn’t just sitting on one vulnerable server. This little project has highlighted how much we rely on these digital spaces, and how important having a solid backup strategy truly is. 

Right now, I'm leaning towards simplifying – maybe just a few key drives, meticulously organized.  Wish me luck!  Anyone else battling the backup beast?
