## Back to Campus, Back to Bags: My Tech-Carry Evolution

Remember 2020? All those online classes felt… distant, right? I definitely did my fair share of coding in pajamas. But now, things are shifting back. I'm seeing a lot of chatter online about students gearing up for in-person learning, and it got me thinking about my own tech-carry evolution.

For years, it was just my laptop in a basic backpack. But as a computer science student, I realized I needed something more streamlined – something like a shoulder bag or even a totepack. It's about adapting, isn't it? Finding the right gear to support how *you* learn and work. Anyone else rethinking their daily carry after a year of remote life? What are your backpack recommendations for navigating campus life again?
