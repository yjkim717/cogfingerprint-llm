## The Algorithm of Anxiety: My Post-Grad Dilemma in a Coding World

Okay, let's be honest. 2021 has been…a lot. Globally, personally, you name it. But for me, a freshly minted Computer Science graduate, it’s been a particularly introspective kind of chaotic. I’m staring down the barrel of a job search, and the feeling isn't exactly triumphant. It’s more like staring into a black box, hoping something pops out that vaguely resembles a career.

The degree felt like a monumental achievement, a culmination of late nights fueled by instant ramen and the sheer stubbornness to debug a particularly nasty piece of code. I genuinely *enjoy* problem-solving, the logic puzzles that coding presents. But the reality of the job market has hit me hard.

The sheer volume of applications I’ve submitted feels…pathetic. Hundreds. Seriously. And the response? Mostly silence. The occasional polite rejection email, thanking me for my interest but stating that I "lacked the necessary experience."  Experience. That’s the monster under the bed, isn’t it? Everyone wants experience, but how do you *get* experience without a job? It’s a classic catch-22.

My resume, I’ll admit, is a bit…sparse in the internship department. Life happened. Finances weren’t always cooperative. Opportunities weren’t always readily available.  I focused on the coursework, trying to build a solid foundation. But now, looking at the profiles of my peers – brimming with internship titles at Google, Amazon, Facebook – I can’t help but feel a pang of…something. Not just envy, but a kind of low-humming anxiety.

I’ve been wrestling with this feeling for weeks.  Scrolling through LinkedIn, feeling increasingly inadequate. Reading articles about the booming tech industry, the demand for skilled developers…and then reading a rejection email. It’s a rollercoaster.

Lately, I’ve been seriously considering a bootcamp.  Places like App Academy keep popping up in my searches. The promise is alluring: intensive training, focused on practical skills, career services, and a fast track to a job.  It feels like a shortcut, a way to level the playing field.

But there’s a hesitation. The cost is significant. It's a huge investment of time and money, essentially trading stability for a bet on a quicker path.  And the whole concept feels a little… unconventional, compared to the traditional academic route I’ve taken.  Is it a legitimate alternative, or just a marketing hype machine preying on the anxieties of graduates like me?

I’ve talked to some people who’ve gone the bootcamp route. The stories are mixed. Some landed amazing jobs immediately after graduation, others struggled to find anything. It seems the success rate isn’t always what the marketing materials suggest.

Ultimately, I feel like I’m trying to optimize for happiness and stability in a world that increasingly feels like a complex algorithm.  Where’s
