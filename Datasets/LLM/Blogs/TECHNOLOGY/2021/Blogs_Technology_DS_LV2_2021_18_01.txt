It was supposed to be a simple network upgrade in 2021. My trusty Cisco 2811, running IOS 12.4, had served me well for years. I had its configuration backed up, a perfect blueprint for the new router.

But then came the moment of truth. The backup router, sleek and modern, was on IOS 15. As I pasted the old config, the command line lit up with errors. It was like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole; the languages were just different enough to cause chaos.

That afternoon taught me a hard lesson about compatibility. Technology evolves, and sometimes, the old ways just don't translate. It’s not just about having a backup—it’s about ensuring it speaks the same language.
