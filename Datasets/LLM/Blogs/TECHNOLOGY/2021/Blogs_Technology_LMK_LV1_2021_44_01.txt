As I navigated Trading212 in 2021, I found myself pondering the distinction between their 'Invest' and 'ISA' options. With my low trading volume, I wasn't sure which route to take. After some digging, I discovered that the key difference lies in tax implications. ISAs offer tax-free gains, but come with certain restrictions. For a casual trader like me, 'Invest' might be the way to go - but it's essential to weigh your options carefully to make an informed decision.
