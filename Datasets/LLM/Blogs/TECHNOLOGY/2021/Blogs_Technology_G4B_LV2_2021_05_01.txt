**Lost in the Silicon Echo**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We build these incredible, interconnected worlds with technology, yet sometimes feel profoundly…alone. I was talking to a friend last week – a brilliant coder who recently moved from Mumbai to the Bay Area – and he was wrestling with a feeling I recognize deeply: a quiet anxiety. 

He’s a fantastic tech worker, brimming with ideas, but admitted to feeling vulnerable navigating a new city, especially after the isolation of the last year. He’s an immigrant, adjusting to a culture, and frankly, just wanting to *feel* safe.  It made me think about how easily we get lost in the Silicon echo, focused on innovation, forgetting the very human need for security and connection.  What steps can we take to build a more supportive community, both online and off?
