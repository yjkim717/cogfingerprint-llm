Of course, here is a reflective blog post about technology from 2021.

### The Uninvited Guest in My Digital Home

Remember that friend who shows up to your small, carefully planned dinner party with an uninvited plus-one? That’s exactly what my new smart speaker felt like in 2021.

I was an early adopter. I had my routines down. My lights, thermostat, and even my coffee maker were all synced up, humming along in a beautiful, efficient symphony. My digital ecosystem was my own little "ark," a curated world I’d built to weather the chaos of modern life. The characters—my loyal robot vacuum, my steadfast smart plug—all had their roles.

Then came the speaker. Let's call her "Helena."

On paper, Helena was a marvel. A new model with better sound and a wider knowledge base. But integrating her was like forcing a new character into a show's final season. She disrupted the established lore of my home. My old speaker knew I meant "a bit warmer" as two degrees. Helena would blast the heat, interpreting my casual phrase with robotic literalism. She’d chime in with unsolicited news briefs, disrupting the morning peace my older devices had learned to preserve.

It wasn't that she was bad technology. She was just… unnecessary. Her addition felt like pandering to a feature checklist I didn’t ask for, disrupting the pacing of my daily life. It made me realize that in our rush to add the newest tech, we often forget the most important feature: harmony. A tool should slot into your life, not force your life to contort around its new, disruptive lore.

Now, Helena sits unplugged. Sometimes, the most advanced feature is knowing when something—or someone—just doesn’t fit the story you’re trying to live.
