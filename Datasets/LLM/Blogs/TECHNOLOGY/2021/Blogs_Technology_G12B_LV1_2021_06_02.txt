>## The Algorithm Said "Maybe" (and My Patience Said "Nope")

Okay, so I need to vent. Job hunting in 2021 feels… different. It’s less about shaking hands and more about battling automated systems. I recently went through an application process for a junior data analyst role at a mid-sized firm. Seemed promising! I tailored my resume, aced the initial skills assessment (thanks, online tutorials!), and even got a virtual interview.

The interview itself was… strange. The interviewer, clearly reading from a script, asked a series of theoretical questions I hadn't prepared for. He offered vague feedback, mostly circling around phrases like, "We'll keep your profile on file" and "We're exploring different options." 

It felt eerily similar to that story I read about a CVS interview where the manager just strung someone along. Like, the algorithm pre-screened me, the human gave me a courtesy nod, and then… nothing. Just a polite rejection email three weeks later. 

Honestly, it’s demoralizing. It makes you question the point of investing time and effort when the process feels so impersonal. Maybe I'm just cynical, but I'm craving a little more genuine human connection in the job search. Anyone else feeling this way?
