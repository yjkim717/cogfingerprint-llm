The open road is calling, and my map of Canada is spread across the kitchen table. The grand plan is to drive west from New Brunswick, soaking in the vastness of this country. While the big destinations are exciting, I find myself most curious about the stretches in between—specifically, the smaller Ontario cities that will serve as my nightly havens.

My priority is finding safe, welcoming places to rest. I'm looking for those gems off the major highways: cities like Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, or Sudbury, where I can find a comfortable motel or a local B&B, grab a hot meal, and recharge for the next day's drive. This part of the journey isn't about rushing through; it's about discovering the character and quiet charm of Ontario's smaller urban centres, one overnight stay at a time.

### The Unplanned Digital Detox

It’s funny how a forced change can reframe your perspective. In 2021, my trusty laptop, a veteran of countless work-from-home Zooms, finally gave out. For three days, I was stuck waiting for a replacement, my main screen reduced to the small rectangle of my phone.

At first, the anxiety was real. I felt disconnected and behind. But by the second day, a shift happened. Without the constant pings and tabs, I picked up a book I’d been meaning to read for a year. I went for a walk without a podcast in my ears, just the sound of the neighbourhood.

That tiny, unplanned digital detox was a revelation. It wasn’t about hating technology—I eagerly welcomed my new laptop. It was a stark reminder to be its master, not its servant. Now, I intentionally schedule screen-free hours, guarding that quiet space the broken laptop so unexpectedly gifted me.
