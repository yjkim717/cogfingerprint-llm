>## The Unexpected Comfort of Disconnecting

Remember when "unplugging" felt like a radical act? Back in 2021, it was a wellness trend, a challenge to put down the phone and *just be*. I used to feel guilty, staring at my screen for hours, chasing notifications and fleeting dopamine hits. Then, last summer, my car's GPS went haywire somewhere between Winnipeg and Thunder Bay on a cross-Canada road trip. 

Suddenly, I was relying on paper maps, asking for directions, *talking* to people. The feeling of being utterly lost, ironically, was incredibly freeing. I rediscovered the joy of observation, the quiet beauty of the landscape unfolding without a filter. 

It wasn't about rejecting technology entirely, but about recognizing its power – and choosing when to relinquish it. Now, I actively schedule "offline hours," and the quiet that follows is surprisingly comforting. It's a reminder that the best discoveries often happen when you’re not looking at a screen.
