"Transparency Time: A Mid-Year Update on Constantiam Shop Sales

As we cruise through 2021, I'm taking a moment to reflect on the Constantiam shop's performance. It's been a wild ride, and I'm excited to share some numbers with you. Our sales have been trickling in, and I'm happy to report that we've raked in $206.73 in revenue so far. But what really warms my heart is that we've been able to donate a total of $73.05 to PhantomCaptain's endeavors over at Constantiam.net.

As someone who's passionate about leveraging technology for good, it's fulfilling to see our efforts translate into tangible support for a cause I believe in. The Constantiam shop may be a small venture, but it's been amazing to see how our products have resonated with like-minded individuals. Here's to hoping the rest of the year brings even more opportunities to make a positive impact, one sale at a time!"
