"As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2021, I couldn't help but notice the eerie similarity between the algorithms that govern our online lives and the complexities of a well-crafted villain. Both are masters of manipulation, using dark patterns to keep us engaged. But what if we were to give these 'tech villains' a backstory? Perhaps their 'dark theme' is rooted in a desire to connect people, warped by the pressures of a profit-driven industry. As I pondered this, I realized that just like a nuanced villain, technology can be both a force for good and a source of mental health struggles. By acknowledging this complexity, we can begin to design more empathetic digital experiences that promote healthy usage habits and character growth in the digital age. By doing so, we can rewrite the narrative of our relationship with technology, and create a more balanced online world."
