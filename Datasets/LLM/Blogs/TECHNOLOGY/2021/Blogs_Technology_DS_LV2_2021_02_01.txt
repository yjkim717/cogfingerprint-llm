It’s 2021, and I’m back to square one with my Note20 Ultra, feeling a little defeated. That sleek mobile controller I bought with such high hopes? Total letdown. I had visions of breezing through GameCube classics on Dolphin and diving into nostalgic 3DS worlds on Citra, but instead, I got laggy inputs and frustration.

Now, I’m scrolling through forums again, wondering if I should just cave and try Xbox Game Pass streaming instead. But there’s something special about emulation—the tinkering, the personal touch. Maybe the right controller is still out there, waiting to turn my phone into the pocket-sized console of my dreams. Here’s to hoping the next one clicks.
