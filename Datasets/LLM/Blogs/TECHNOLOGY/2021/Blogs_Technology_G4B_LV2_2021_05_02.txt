**The Quiet Hum of Connection**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Back in 2021, we were *obsessed* with the newest gadgets – faster processors, bigger screens. But I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the quiet hum of the internet, the way it connects us to people we might never otherwise reach. 

I recently re-read an interview transcript from a fascinating academic project about euthanasia – a real deep dive into some tough ethical questions. It made me realize how technology, despite its flashy distractions, can actually facilitate profound conversations.  

It's not about the *things* we buy, but how those things allow us to bridge distances and share experiences.  A simple video call can feel like a lifeline, right?
