**The Algorithm and the Echo**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Back in 2021, everyone was obsessed with algorithms. “Optimize your feed!” “Personalize your experience!” We were handing over our attention, our preferences, to these black boxes that promised to show us *exactly* what we wanted. I remember feeling this weird pressure to conform, to build a digital echo chamber of my own interests. 

But lately, I’ve been thinking about something different. Like a Lore Bard trying to juggle prepared spells and known spells, I realized I was spread too thin.  Constantly chasing the next perfectly tailored suggestion felt exhausting.  

I started consciously stepping *away* from the recommendations.  Just… browsing.  And you know what? I discovered some genuinely surprising things.  It's a reminder that maybe, just maybe, the most interesting experiences happen when you let the algorithm take a backseat.
