**My Digital Ghost Car**

It’s 2021, and I’m being haunted. Not by a spirit, but by a ghost car—a digital phantom that keeps racking up parking tickets in a city I’ve never visited. My old license plates are the culprit, somehow still active in the system despite being canceled and physically surrendered at the DMV months ago.

I’ve spent hours on hold, filled out endless online forms, and even filed a police report, all to prove this vehicle isn't mine. It’s a surreal nightmare, a glitch in the matrix made real. You’d think in this age of seamless technology, a simple database update wouldn’t be so impossible. This digital doppelgänger is a stark reminder that our systems are only as smart as the brittle, human processes behind them.
