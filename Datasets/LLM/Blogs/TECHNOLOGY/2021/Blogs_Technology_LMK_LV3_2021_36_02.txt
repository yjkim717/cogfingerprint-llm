"My Monero mining rig was driving me crazy in 2021! Despite being dedicated solely to mining, its hashrate was as unstable as a rollercoaster ride. I accessed it remotely, troubleshooting every issue, but the fluctuations persisted. It was a frustrating experience, but I learned the importance of monitoring and tweaking my rig's settings. A stable hashrate is crucial for maximizing mining efficiency - a lesson that still resonates with me today."
