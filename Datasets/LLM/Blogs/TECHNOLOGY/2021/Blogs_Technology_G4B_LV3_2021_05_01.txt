**The Weight of a New City, a New Worry**

Moving to the Bay Area felt like stepping into a sci-fi movie – incredible innovation, but also… a little unsettling. As a recent transplant, a software engineer chasing a dream, I was grappling with a quiet anxiety. I’d heard the stories, of course – the headlines about safety, the whispers about walking alone at night. 

I’m an immigrant, navigating a landscape that felt both exhilarating and, frankly, intimidating. The thought of relying on public transport after the pandemic, or just walking home from a late-night meeting, sparked a need for something more than just vigilance. I started researching self-defense classes, a small step to feel a little more grounded. 

It’s a weird feeling, wanting to feel prepared in a place built on such boundless optimism.  It’s about more than just safety; it’s about feeling like you truly belong, and building a sense of confidence in this new chapter.
