**The CVS Interview That Made Me Rethink Everything**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year. I was fresh out of my technical school program, buzzing with confidence and armed with a pretty decent resume. I landed an interview at a local CVS – seemed like a good, steady job. But it quickly turned into a masterclass in unprofessionalism. 

The manager just kept rambling, asking irrelevant questions, and honestly, the language he used was pretty rough. It felt like my time was being completely wasted. It really got me thinking about the *experience* of applying for jobs, beyond just the skills on a CV. 

It made me realize how important it is to advocate for yourself and not tolerate disrespectful behavior, even when you’re desperate for a start.  What’s your experience been like?  Let’s talk about it in the comments! #jobsearch #techschool #resume #interviewexperience
