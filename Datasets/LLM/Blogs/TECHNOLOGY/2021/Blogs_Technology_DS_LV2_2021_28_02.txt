Back in 2021, I was glued to CollegeVine’s admit calculator, obsessing over my CS program chances. It felt like a digital oracle—safety, target, reach—all neatly categorized. But as I clicked through predictions, I realized something unsettling: I was letting an algorithm narrate my future. The numbers offered a comforting illusion of control, yet they couldn’t capture my passion or resilience. It was a stark reminder that in our tech-saturated world, data can guide, but it shouldn’t dictate our dreams. Trust yourself more than the machine.
