## The Unexpected Joy of Digital Transparency (and a Really Good Hoodie)

Okay, so things have been a little quiet on the Constantiam front lately. Life, you know? But I wanted to share a quick update – and it’s surprisingly heartwarming. We launched a small shop a while back, mostly as a way to support the project and build a little community. Honestly, we weren't expecting much.

The sales have been… modest. But there’s a story in that, isn't there? It’s a reminder that building something meaningful isn’t always about massive numbers. And then, a completely unexpected thing happened: a hoodie design *really* took off. Like, surprisingly profitable took off! Plus, someone accidentally donated a generous amount – a genuine “whoops, meant to buy a sticker!” moment that just made us smile.

It’s a testament, I think, to the power of transparency. Sharing our journey, even the slow parts, seems to have fostered a connection. It’s a reminder that genuine effort, even if it doesn’t scream from the rooftops, can still resonate. And sometimes, a really good hoodie can make all the difference.
