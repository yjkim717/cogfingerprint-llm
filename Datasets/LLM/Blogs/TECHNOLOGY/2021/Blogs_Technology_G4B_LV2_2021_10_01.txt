**The Spreadsheet Dream: Could an Algorithm Help Me Retire?**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 felt… intense, right? Between the pandemic, rising prices, and a constant stream of bad news, the idea of “normal” felt pretty distant. I found myself obsessing over the small, controllable things, desperately trying to build a little stability. And, like a lot of us, I started staring at spreadsheets.

It wasn’t a grand, strategic plan at first. Just a simple one – a way to track my spending and see if I was actually making progress towards any goals. But then I stumbled across this Reddit thread, and it completely shifted my perspective. A guy was mapping out a 21-year plan to buy *eight* rental properties, fueled entirely by reinvesting the profits. Seriously.

It’s a wild thought, isn’t it? The idea of using technology – algorithms, data analysis – to essentially engineer a path to early retirement. It felt a little overwhelming, a little…robotic. But also, strangely appealing. 

I started playing around with my own numbers, tweaking the scenario. It forced me to really think about my priorities, about what I *actually* wanted.  Maybe I don't need eight properties. Maybe a smaller, more manageable investment is enough. 

The key takeaway? Technology isn't about replacing human intuition, it’s about amplifying it. It’s about giving us the data we need to make informed decisions, to chase those seemingly impossible dreams – even if they start with a single, carefully crafted spreadsheet.
