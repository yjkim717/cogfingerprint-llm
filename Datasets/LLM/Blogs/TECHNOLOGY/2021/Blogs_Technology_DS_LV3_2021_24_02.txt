It’s 2021, and I’m grinding CS:GO solo queue on Inferno, hitting that same wall every match. Without the right spawns for banana or apps, I feel powerless trying to claim arches or short control. It’s just me, my instincts, and the chaos of random teammates. In those moments, I realize how much of tech—and gaming—is about adapting to the hand you’re dealt, not just the tools you have. Sometimes, the real battle is against uncertainty itself.
