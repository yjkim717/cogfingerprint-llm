It’s 2021, and I’m deep in a CS:GO match, running that nostalgic 4:3 stretched fullscreen. I tab out for one second to check a message—big mistake. When I try to tab back in, the game just boots me to my desktop, leaving my team hanging. It’s a small tech quirk, but it reminds me how fragile our digital focus can be. One click, and the immersion shatters.
