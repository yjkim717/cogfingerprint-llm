"Lost in the Scroll"

As I caught myself mindlessly scrolling through social media for the umpteenth time today, I couldn't help but wonder - are we truly connected? It's 2021, and technology has brought the world to our fingertips. Yet, I'm left feeling isolated, comparing my life to the curated highlight reels of others. The constant stream of information is overwhelming, making it difficult to distinguish between what's real and what's just an algorithm-driven echo chamber. I'm not alone in feeling this way; many are now questioning the impact of technology on our mental health and relationships. As we continue to innovate and integrate technology into our daily lives, it's essential we pause to consider the human cost. Are we using technology to enhance our lives, or are we losing ourselves in the process?
