>## The Algorithm and the Unthinkable

I stumbled across a video the other day that genuinely shook me. It explored the incredibly difficult topic of euthanasia, specifically focusing on the Groningen Protocol – a practice where, under strict conditions, children experiencing unbearable suffering are given assistance to die. It’s a conversation that feels almost too heavy to have, and hearing pediatricians like Eduard Verhagen and families like Bernadette Tobin share their experiences… well, it’s profoundly moving.

What struck me wasn't just the ethical complexity of the situation (and there's *so* much to unpack there), but how it mirrored a growing unease I have with technology. We're increasingly handing over decisions – medical, financial, even personal – to algorithms. These systems are designed for efficiency, for optimization. But can an algorithm truly grasp the nuances of human suffering, the weight of individual choice? 

It made me wonder: as we build increasingly sophisticated AI, are we prepared for the uncomfortable questions it will force us to confront about the value of life and the limits of our compassion? It’s a lot to consider, especially in 2021, when tech feels woven into the very fabric of our existence.
