**The Visa Tango & Code Anxiety**

It’s weird, right? Being a software engineer in 2021 felt like a constant tightrope walk. I’d landed a fantastic offer from a UK-based company – seriously, the kind of role that made you actually *want* to code – and the excitement was bubbling. Then the visa questions hit. 

I’m American, and my student visa was running out.  I was hesitant to even reply to the recruiter, remembering a previous, incredibly stressful border encounter when my documentation wasn’t quite perfect. It’s a ridiculous amount of anxiety to feel about a job offer!  

Honestly, it’s a reflection of how complex things are getting, especially for tech folks wanting to build careers abroad.  It makes you wonder if the dream of global tech is becoming a logistical nightmare.  Anyone else feeling this?
