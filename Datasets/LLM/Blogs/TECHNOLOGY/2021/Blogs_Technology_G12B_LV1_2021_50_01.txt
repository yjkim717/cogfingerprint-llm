## Downloaded and Disappointed? My YouTube Premium Quandary

Okay, so I finally caved and got YouTube Premium last year. Offline viewing felt like a necessity with my spotty commute. But something’s been bugging me. When I download videos, does choosing a higher resolution *actually* mean better audio? It feels like it shouldn’t, but I've noticed some downloaded videos sounding a little…flat. Anyone else experienced this? Maybe I’m just imagining things, but it's a small frustration in an otherwise seamless experience.
