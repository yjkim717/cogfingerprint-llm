## The Algorithm Knows, But Does It *See*?

It's 2021, and I’m increasingly fascinated by how much predictive text knows. Seriously, it finishes my sentences before *I* do. It feels a bit like a digital Magic 8-Ball, offering possibilities, nudging me down paths. But is it genuine insight, like a wise genie, or just a clever rearrangement of data? Sometimes I wonder if these algorithms, for all their processing power, truly *see* the nuance of human thought, or just the patterns we leave behind. A bit unsettling, isn’t it?
