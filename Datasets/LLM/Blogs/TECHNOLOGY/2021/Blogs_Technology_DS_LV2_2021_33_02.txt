It’s 2021, and I’m still wrestling with my CS:GO setup—4:3 stretched, fullscreen, the works. But every time I tab out to skip a song on Spotify or check a Discord message, it’s like rolling dice. Will the game welcome me back, or leave me staring at my desktop, wondering why such a simple task feels like a tech betrayal? In these moments, convenience and immersion wage a silent war on my screen.
