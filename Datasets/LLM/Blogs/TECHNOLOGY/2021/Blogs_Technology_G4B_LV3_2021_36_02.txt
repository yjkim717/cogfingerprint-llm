**The Ghost in the Machine**

It’s a strange feeling, wrestling with a computer that seems to have a mind of its own. My friend was battling a Monero miner – it was throwing out crazy hashrate spikes, then just…nothing.  He couldn't even get close to fixing it remotely, no local access to troubleshoot. It felt like dealing with a digital ghost.  These performance issues, especially with crypto mining, highlight how fragile our tech can be, and how isolating it can be when you’re stuck battling a problem you can’t directly see.  It’s a frustrating reminder that sometimes, the most complex systems are also the most mysterious.
