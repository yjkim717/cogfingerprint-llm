### The Infinite Scroll and My Finite Attention

It’s 2021, and my phone is a slot machine I carry in my pocket. Every notification, a potential jackpot. I’d open my laptop with the noble intention of finally writing that report, only to find myself, twenty minutes later, deep in a YouTube rabbit hole about the history of the paperclip.

My procrastination wasn’t just laziness; it was a full-blown perspectivization problem. I was giving the trivial—a random comment, a new app feature—the same mental weight as my actual deadlines. The guilt was a constant, low hum.

Then I stumbled upon an old Stoic idea: control what you can. I started a simple, tech-adjacent spiritual exercise. For the first hour of my day, the phone stays in another room. It’s my modern version of a Stoic practice, a deliberate barrier against the digital chaos.

It’s not about self-deprecation anymore. It’s about reclaiming my focus, one disconnected morning at a time. The scroll is infinite, but my attention doesn’t have to be.
