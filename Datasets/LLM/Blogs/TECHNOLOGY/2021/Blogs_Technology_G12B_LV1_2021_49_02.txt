>## The Zoom Beard & the Unexpected Connection

It's 2021, and most of my job interviews have been conducted over Zoom. I always meticulously clean up – ironed shirt, tidy background, the works. But the facial hair? That's been a bit of a question mark. I've been letting it grow for a while now, a comfortable, slightly scruffy thing. 

I worried it might project a lack of seriousness, a lack of *professionalism* in the traditional sense. But you know what? I’ve actually found it helped. It feels more *me*. And somehow, connecting with interviewers as my authentic self, even with a bit of beard, felt more genuine, more engaging. Maybe the polished perfection of the past is fading, and authenticity is the new interview edge.
