>## The Algorithm and My College Dreams

Okay, so I'm deep in the college application trenches, right? And like everyone else, I’ve been wrestling with that terrifying question: Where should I apply? I started using CollegeVine, hoping for some algorithmic guidance, especially for my CS program aspirations. Their "safety," "target," and "reach" categories felt…off. Like, a school listed as a "target" for someone with a 4.0 and perfect scores felt like a genuine stretch for me.

It made me realize something bigger. We're putting so much trust in these platforms, these algorithms built on past data, to shape our future. But college isn’t just numbers. It's fit, and vibe, and opportunity. Maybe the human element—researching professors, imagining myself on campus—still matters more than any prediction. 2021 feels like a year where we're all questioning what we *should* trust.
