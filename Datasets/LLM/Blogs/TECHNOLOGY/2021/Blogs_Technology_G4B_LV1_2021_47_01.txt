**My Printer’s Mid-Life Crisis (and Why I Almost Gave Up)**

Okay, let’s be honest – I’ve had a complicated relationship with my Lexmark E260dn. It’s been a reliable workhorse for years, churning out reports and family photos, but lately, it’s been throwing a serious tantrum. A persistent orange LED, coupled with a worrying bit of toner leakage, had me pulling my hair out. 

I spent a whole afternoon wrestling with firmware updates and checking the paper tray – you know, the usual tech troubleshooting. It felt ridiculously frustrating for a machine that’s supposed to *simplify* things. 

Honestly, there were moments I considered just buying a new printer. But something made me stick it out.  It’s a reminder, I think, that even the most dependable tech needs a little care, and sometimes, a little patience.  Anyone else had a similar tech battle lately?
