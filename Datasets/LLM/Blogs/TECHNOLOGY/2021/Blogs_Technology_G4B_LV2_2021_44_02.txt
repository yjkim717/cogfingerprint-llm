Remember 2021? It felt like everything was moving *fast*. Especially online. I was glued to Reddit, watching these penny stocks on Trading212 shoot up – a dizzying, almost frantic ride.  A friend was convinced we should sell, terrified of the inevitable crash.  But the lure of quick gains was powerful. 

It really got me thinking about our “pie portfolio” – spreading investments, not putting all our eggs in one volatile basket.  And, honestly, the whole thing felt a little…off. Like a classic “pump and dump.”  Sometimes, the most sensible move isn’t the flashiest, but the one that protects your peace of mind.  What do you think?
