As an ecommerce business owner in 2021, I was stumped by the surge in international returns. Shipping outside the EU was already complex, but handling returns across borders was a nightmare. I was hit with hefty customs fees, eating into my profit margins. After some research, I discovered the EU's returns policy and streamlined my process. I now pre-pay customs fees for international returns and clearly communicate my returns policy to customers. It's been a game-changer, saving me time and money. Has anyone else found a similar solution to handling international ecommerce returns?
