## Exodus and the Hidden Costs of Convenience

I’ve been playing around with Exodus Wallet for a while now, really digging the interface and the sheer number of coins it supports. The built-in exchange feature seemed like a brilliant idea – swap Bitcoin for Cardano right within the app? Genius! But I ran into a bit of a wall recently. 

Trying to move a small amount of BTC to ADA, I was frankly shocked by the fees. Suddenly, the convenience felt less appealing. It got me thinking about the trade-offs we make with these all-in-one platforms. Do we sacrifice a bit of cost-effectiveness for the ease of having everything in one place? It's a question I'm still pondering, especially as crypto adoption continues to grow and transaction costs become increasingly important. Maybe sticking to dedicated exchanges for larger swaps is the smarter move after all.
