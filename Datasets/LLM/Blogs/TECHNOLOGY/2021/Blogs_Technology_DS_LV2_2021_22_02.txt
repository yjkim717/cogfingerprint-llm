### The Digital Ghosts in My Machine

It was one of those weeks in 2021 where my coffee had gone cold before I’d even taken a sip. The helpdesk tickets were piling up—"Can't log in," "My desktop won't load." The culprit? Our VMware Horizon environment was throwing cryptic provisioning errors, and my usual bag of tricks was empty.

I felt like a digital detective on a bad case. All signs pointed to our vSAN hitting some mysterious capacity limit for components. But we had plenty of raw storage! It made no sense. I was staring at charts and logs, feeling the pressure mount with every new ticket. It’s a lonely feeling, being the person responsible for a system that’s quietly failing.

Then, in a moment of frustrated clarity, I dug deeper. And I found them: orphaned VMDK files. Digital ghosts. Left behind by instant clones that had long since vanished, these phantom files were silently consuming precious component slots, choking our ability to create new virtual desktops.

The fix, in the end, was a simple cleanup script. But the lesson was profound. It’s the things you *don't* see, the silent accumulation of digital debris, that can bring a sophisticated system to its knees. It taught me to look beyond the obvious, to question the empty spaces in the data, and to always, always listen for the quietest problems. They’re often the ones screaming the loudest.
