It’s funny—in 2021, I found myself talking to my phone more than to some people. I’d ask it for directions, the weather, even a joke when the road felt endless. It was on a solo drive through Ontario, chasing the sunset toward Thunder Bay, that I realized how much I relied on that little screen.

My grandfather used to navigate with a paper map and a sense of adventure. I had Siri and a playlist that knew my mood better than I did. Technology wasn’t just a tool; it was my co-pilot, my planner, my late-night confidant. And in those quiet moments, staring at the star-dusted sky over Lake Superior, I didn’t feel alone. I felt connected—to the world, to the past, and to the hum of something greater, all through a device that fit in my palm.
