Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided summary, aiming for a conversational tone and approximately 246 words, set in 2021:

**Pixels and Quiet**

It’s funny, isn’t it? I spend my days wrestling with code, building intricate systems, and generally feeling like I’m *doing* something. Yet, a lot of the time, I feel… profoundly alone. I’m in my early forties now, and the diagnosis of Asperger’s came a few years back, and suddenly a lot of things started making a weird kind of sense. But it didn’t magically fix the feeling of being on the outside looking in.

I chose software engineering partly because it felt…logical. Predictable. A world of ones and zeros, where rules applied and everything could be broken down into manageable steps. But the reality of working in a team, even a remote one, has been a constant tightrope walk. The constant small talk, the social cues I just…miss, the fear of saying the wrong thing – it’s exhausting. 

Honestly, there have been times this year, particularly during lockdown, when the isolation has been crushing. The loneliness isn't the dramatic, cinematic kind you see in movies. It’s a low-humming anxiety, a persistent awareness of not quite *fitting*. I’ve had to actively fight back waves of depression, pushing myself to attend virtual meetups, even when it felt incredibly draining. 

I'm also navigating a tricky visa situation, adding another layer of stress. It’s a constant reminder that my world feels incredibly fragile right now.  I’m learning to be kinder to myself, recognizing that my way of processing the world isn’t a flaw, but a different way of being. And maybe, just maybe, that’s okay.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
