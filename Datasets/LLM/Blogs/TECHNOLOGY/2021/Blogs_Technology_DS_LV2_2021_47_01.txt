### The Printer and My Patience: A 2021 Story

It’s funny how a piece of office equipment can become the antagonist in your day. For me, that was my Lexmark E260dn. It started with a simple, stubborn message: "Paper Tray Error." I did the logical things—checked for jams, reseated the tray, even gave it a good, firm nudge (we’ve all been there). Nothing.

As I sat on the floor, surrounded by loose toner smudges, it hit me. This wasn't just a printer problem; it was a 2021 problem. After a year of remote work, my patience for finicky technology had worn thin. My first instinct wasn't to dig deeper physically, but to search online for a magical firmware update—a digital cure for a very physical frustration.

It was a small moment, but a telling one. We’ve started expecting our devices to self-heal with a software patch, forgetting that sometimes, the solution is just a little more old-fashioned elbow grease and a lot less loose toner. The experience was a humble reminder that not every error message has a high-tech fix.
