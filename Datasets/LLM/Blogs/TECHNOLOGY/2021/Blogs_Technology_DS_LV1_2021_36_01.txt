Looking back at my mining setup in 2021, I can’t help but laugh at my own desperation. My old laptops were literally cooking themselves—one even warped from the heat. That’s when I spotted a local deal: refurbished Dell Latitude i5s for just €50 each.

I thought, "Three or four of these could replace my dying rigs and maybe turn a profit with Monero." It felt like a clever, scrappy solution at the time. But part of me wondered—was I just delaying the inevitable? Chasing small gains while hardware sizzled away in the corner.

In the end, it was a lesson in balancing ambition with reality, one overheated machine at a time.
