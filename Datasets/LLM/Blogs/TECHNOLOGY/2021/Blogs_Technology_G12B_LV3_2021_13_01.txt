>## The Algorithm Didn't Know My Mom Was Gone

It's 2021, and you’d think in this age of instant information, of digital everything, navigating life's complexities would be…easier. Right? I'm here to tell you, sometimes it’s just baffling. I’m an expat in France, trying to renew my temporary work visa. A routine process, or so I thought.

I’ve submitted mountains of paperwork, paid fees, jumped through hoops. Then came *the* email. A request for something utterly unexpected: my parents' birth certificates. My *deceased* parents' birth certificates.

Seriously?

Suddenly, I’m not just dealing with the French bureaucracy – a legend in its own right – but also dredging up grief and scrambling to find official documents that have been tucked away for decades. My mom passed away years ago, and Dad not long after. Why, after all this time, does *this* matter? Apparently, it's tied to some obscure clause about proving familial ties for my CAF (housing assistance) benefits, which are now suddenly in jeopardy.

It’s profoundly frustrating. It feels like a faceless algorithm, ticking boxes, completely devoid of human understanding. It doesn't know my mom is gone. It doesn’t know the emotional toll this is taking. It just needs a piece of paper.

This whole experience has made me reflect on our reliance on technology. We celebrate its efficiency, its speed, but sometimes I wonder if we’ve lost something vital – the ability to apply a little common sense, a little empathy, to the processes that govern our lives. I'm still chasing those birth certificates, and hoping my visa gets renewed, but right now, I’m just trying to remember that behind every form and every system, there's a person trying to navigate it all too.
