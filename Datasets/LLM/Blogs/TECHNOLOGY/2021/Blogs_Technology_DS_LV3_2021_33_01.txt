It’s 2021, and I’m chasing that buttery-smooth FPS in Krunker on Brave. I’ve disabled every frame-rate cap, cranked up hardware acceleration, and my GPU should be singing. Yet, the stutters persist. It’s a digital ghost in the machine, a reminder that even with all the right settings, technology has a mind of its own. The perfect game remains just out of reach.
