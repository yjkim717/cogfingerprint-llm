"Migrating to Java 11: A Regex Pattern Matching Lesson Learned"

As I recently migrated our Java application from version 8 to 11, I encountered a frustrating issue that had me scratching my head. The problem? Regex pattern matching was behaving differently. It turned out that changes in the Java VM between versions 8 and 11 were the culprit. Specifically, the way the VM handles regex pattern matching had been altered, causing our existing code to break. After digging through documentation and debugging, I finally found the solution. It was a simple change, but one that was easy to miss. This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly testing code during version migrations. If you're planning to upgrade to Java 11, be sure to scrutinize your regex patterns - you might just save yourself a headache. In 2021, staying on top of tech updates is crucial, and I'm glad I can now share this hard-won knowledge.
