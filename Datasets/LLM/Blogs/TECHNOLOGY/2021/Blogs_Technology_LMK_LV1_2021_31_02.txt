"As I dove into modeling cellular behavior in 2021, I realized that a cellular automaton simulation could reveal the intricacies of molecular biology. To make it happen, I needed a comprehensive dataset on enzymes, receptors, and chemical reactions within cells. I began scouring research papers and databases, hoping to find the perfect fit. The quest was on to marry technology with biology, and I was excited to see how this fusion could advance our understanding of cellular processes."
