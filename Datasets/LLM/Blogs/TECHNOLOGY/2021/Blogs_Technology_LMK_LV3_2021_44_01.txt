As I navigated Trading212 in 2021, I found myself pondering the difference between 'invest' and 'ISA' accounts. With a relatively small investment amount, I wondered if I was missing out on tax efficiency. Upon closer inspection, I realized that an ISA account could be a game-changer, allowing me to maximize my returns while minimizing tax liabilities. It was a simple yet crucial decision that made a significant impact on my trading journey.
