**The Ghost in the Machine (and a Surprisingly Good Mic)**

It’s funny how quickly our tech obsessions shift. Back in 2021, I was obsessed with streamlining everything – hardware swaps, optimizing software… I spent way too long wrestling with things like Motu software and trying to get the perfect sound from my USB microphone. 

Recently, I stumbled across a Reddit thread selling a used USANA H Samson GTrack Pro, complete with a mic stand and bundled software. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best tech isn’t about the newest gadgets, but about finding a reliable tool that just *works*.  A little bit of analog in a digital world – it’s a nice feeling, isn't it?
