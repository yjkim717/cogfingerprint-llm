"I'm still reeling from my penny stock gamble on Trading212. In just a month, my investment surged 200% - but now I'm paranoid it's a pump and dump scheme. I'm torn between cashing in and holding on for more gains. As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that investing is as much about gut instinct as strategy. Should I sell now or ride the wave? The uncertainty is a harsh reminder that in the world of trading, there's no one-size-fits-all advice."
