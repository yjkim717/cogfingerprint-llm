It’s 2021, and I’m staring at my screen, feeling like a lone wolf on Inferno. No comms, no coordination—just me, a questionable spawn, and the eternal struggle for mid control. It’s funny how a game can mirror life: sometimes, you’re dealt a bad hand, and you just have to improvise. Tech connects us, but it can’t fix human unpredictability. Still, there’s beauty in that chaos—learning to adapt, finding small victories. Maybe that’s the real win, even when the round’s already lost.
