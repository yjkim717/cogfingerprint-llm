## The Quiet Crisis in Our DNS Health

It’s funny the things that keep you up at night. Lately, it's been DNS. Not a catastrophic outage, thankfully, but a persistent, nagging feeling that we weren't *really* seeing what was happening under the hood. We were getting alerts for "Zone Query Overload" on our Windows Server 2016 DNS servers, which is good – catching potential issues is key! But the alerts themselves felt… insufficient. Just a blaring "OVERLOAD!" wasn’t giving us enough context.

We needed to understand *how much* overload, and what constituted a new baseline. It felt like trying to steer a ship with a blurry radar. Ultimately, we dove into reporting specific alert values, and it's already proving invaluable. Small tweaks, informed by actual data, are making a real difference. It's a quiet crisis averted, one DNS query at a time.
