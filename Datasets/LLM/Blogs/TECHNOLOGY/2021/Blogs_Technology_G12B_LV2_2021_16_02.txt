## Remember When We All Learned to Zoom?

It's funny, isn't it? Just a couple of years ago, “Zoom” was a weird word you might associate with telescopes. Now, it’s practically a verb. 2020 threw us all a curveball, and suddenly, technology we’d previously taken for granted – video calls, online collaboration tools – became lifelines.

I remember the initial awkwardness, the frantic searches for “how to unmute myself,” the accidental filters. But then something shifted. We adapted. We connected. We even started *enjoying* it.

It’s a good reminder, I think, that technology isn’t inherently good or bad. It’s a tool. And like any tool, its value lies in how we use it. It forced us to learn, to be a little more patient with ourselves and each other, and ultimately, to find new ways to bridge distances.  I wonder what new skills we'll be picking up in 2021?
