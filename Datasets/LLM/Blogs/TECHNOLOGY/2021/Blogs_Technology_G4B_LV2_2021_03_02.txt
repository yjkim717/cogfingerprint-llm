**The Glitch in My Reflection**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we get so used to the way things *are* that we don't stop to question it. Like, I was scrolling through Instagram last week – a perfectly curated feed of smiling faces and enviable vacations – and it hit me: we’re all living in slightly altered versions of reality, shaped by algorithms and filters. 

It’s not a bad thing, exactly, but it does make you wonder about the original.  I’ve been spending a lot of time lately experimenting with AI image generators, trying to create things that feel… real.  And sometimes, the results are unsettling, like a subtle gender swap or a bizarre alternate universe popping into existence. 

It’s a glitch in my reflection, a reminder that the image we present – online *and* off – is a constructed thing.  And maybe, just maybe, it's okay to lean into the imperfections.
