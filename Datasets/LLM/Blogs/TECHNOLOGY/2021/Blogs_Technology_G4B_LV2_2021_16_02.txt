**The Gentle Frustration of a New Interface**

Okay, let’s be honest – I’ve been wrestling with a new photo editing software lately, and it’s brought back a *very* specific memory. It's the same feeling a new D&D player probably gets staring at a complex dice roll and armor class. That little prickle of frustration, realizing you’re missing a crucial piece of the puzzle. 

I’m used to intuitive design, you know? Everything’s streamlined, clicks lead to results. This new program? It felt like deciphering an ancient code. I kept hitting dead ends, accidentally deleting layers, and generally feeling utterly bewildered. 

It reminded me of how overwhelming D&D can be for someone jumping in. Simple mechanics like ability checks and proficiency feel like a secret language at first. A good tutorial – a clear explanation – is *everything*. It’s not about being “good” at the software; it's about understanding how it *works*.  Anyone else ever feel this way about a new tech?
