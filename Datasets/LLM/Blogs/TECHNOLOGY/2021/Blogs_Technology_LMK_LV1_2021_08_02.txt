"Can I Respond to Job Offers on a Tourist Visa?

As a software engineer from the States, I found myself in the UK on a tourist visa in 2021. With the tech industry booming, I started receiving recruiter messages on LinkedIn. At first, it was exciting to explore potential job opportunities, but then I began to wonder: am I allowed to respond?

The UK's tourist visa comes with a 'no work seeking' restriction. I wasn't sure if simply responding to messages or discussing potential job openings counted as "seeking work." I didn't want to risk jeopardizing my visa status. After some research, I realized that the rules aren't entirely clear-cut. While I'm not allowed to actively job hunt, it's ambiguous whether passive engagement with recruiters is a breach. I'm still torn. Part of me wants to explore the opportunities, while another is cautious about staying within the rules. As a software engineer on a tourist visa, navigating these gray areas can be challenging."
