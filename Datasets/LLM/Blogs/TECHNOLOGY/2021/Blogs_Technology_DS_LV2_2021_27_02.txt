You know, sometimes I miss the simplicity of my old Nokia. In 2021, my smartphone feels like a magic 8-ball I’m constantly shaking for answers—will my video call freeze? Is that notification urgent? It’s a strange kind of digital divination, always guessing what’s next. I’m nostalgic for the days when tech served us, not the other way around. Maybe it’s time to unplug and just look at the real stars for a change.
