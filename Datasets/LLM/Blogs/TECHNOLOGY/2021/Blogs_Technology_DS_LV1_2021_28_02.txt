It’s 2021, and I’m deep in the college search rabbit hole, obsessed with finding CS programs that fit. I’ve spent hours on CollegeVine, staring at those percentage predictions—my "safety" schools suddenly feeling shaky. Are these algorithms really seeing the whole me, or just my stats? It’s a strange moment, trusting tech to map my future while questioning its limits. Building this college list is more than checking boxes; it’s learning to balance data with a dose of old-fashioned gut feeling.
