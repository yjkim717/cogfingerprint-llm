**Remember When We Thought Electric Was *Just* a Buzzword?**

It feels weird to be writing this in 2021, doesn’t it? Like we’re standing on the precipice of something *massive*, something that felt both terrifying and exhilarating all at once. Back then, the air was thick with the promise of electric vehicles, of AI taking over our jobs, of the Metaverse… and honestly, a lot of it felt a little… shiny. Like a really, really expensive, complicated toy.

I remember scrolling through tech news in the summer of ‘21, and feeling a strange mix of excitement and skepticism. Rivian, this brand new EV startup backed by Amazon, was suddenly *everywhere*.  They were pitching rugged adventure trucks, a direct challenge to the established giants, and it felt… audacious. Like someone had just thrown a perfectly polished pebble into the pond and watched it create a surprisingly big ripple. 

That feeling – that sense of a disruptive newcomer – was pretty prevalent across the board. We were seeing it in the rise of decentralized finance, in the breathless (and often confusing) discussions around NFTs, and even in the way we were starting to think about work. The pandemic had forced a massive shift, and suddenly, the idea of working remotely, of building communities online, felt less like a temporary fix and more like a fundamental change. 

It wasn't *just* about the shiny new tech, though. There was a deeper current running beneath it all. A growing unease, a questioning of the status quo. We were seeing the cracks in the foundations of established systems – the inequalities exacerbated by automation, the ethical dilemmas posed by data collection, the sheer speed at which technology seemed to outpace our ability to understand it. 

Rivian, with its focus on adventure and a slightly rebellious spirit, felt like a tiny symbol of that. It wasn't just about building a cool truck; it was about reimagining the way we move, the way we explore, the way we connect with the world around us. 

Looking back, 2021 was a year of immense potential, a year where the future felt both incredibly close and incredibly uncertain.  We were handing over more and more control to algorithms and data, and it was easy to get caught up in the hype.  But there was also a sense that something important was shifting – a recognition that technology isn’t inherently good or bad, it’s simply a tool, and it's *how* we use it that matters. 

Now, as we move further into 2023, I wonder what lessons we learned in that pivotal year. Did we truly grasp the implications of the changes unfolding around us? And more importantly, are we still asking the right questions?
