>## The Quiet Yearning for a Better Alias

It's funny the little things that stick with you in programming, isn't it? Lately, I've been wrestling with type aliases in C3, and it’s sparked a quiet yearning for something… simpler. 

We all know aliases are crucial. They add clarity, prevent repetitive typing, and generally make your code breathe easier. But sometimes, the existing mechanisms in C3 feel a little clunky. I started thinking about languages like Rust, with their elegant `type` keyword, or even the more traditional `typedef` in C. 

Then the idea hit: what if C3 had a `define` keyword that could handle both type aliases *and* simple macro replacement? Imagine a single, versatile tool for streamlining your code. It’s not a radical concept, of course. Many languages have tackled this already. 

It's more of a philosophical thing, really. A desire for a more cohesive, intuitive feel. Maybe it's just me, but I think a well-implemented `define` could bring a subtle but noticeable improvement to the C3 experience. Perhaps 2022 will bring some exciting developments!
