**The Endless Scroll & The Weight of It All**

Okay, be honest – how many of you felt like 2021 was just… a *lot*? Between the pandemic, the news, and the constant stream of everything vying for our attention, it’s no wonder I found myself hitting a wall.  I’d stare at a simple email, and suddenly it felt like climbing Everest.

I started trying to borrow some Stoic techniques – just focusing on what I *could* control, letting go of the rest. And honestly?

Anyone else battling this digital fatigue?
