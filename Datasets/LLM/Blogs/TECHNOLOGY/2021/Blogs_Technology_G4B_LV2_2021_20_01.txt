**The Ghost in the Machine – And My DMV Nightmare**

Remember those weird glitches you’d occasionally catch on the internet? Like, a website suddenly displaying a completely different image? It’s a similar feeling I had last month, but with a very real, very frustrating consequence: my DMV. 

It started with a notification – a claim that *I* was somehow the owner of a car I’d never driven, let alone owned. The DMV, using some kind of automated system, insisted I needed to “prove” car ownership. Seriously? 

It made me think about how much we trust technology. We hand over our data, our preferences, almost our identities, to these algorithms. But what happens when they get it wrong? This whole experience felt like dealing with a digital ghost – a system stubbornly asserting a claim based on… well, nothing. It was a stark reminder that even in 2021, with all our digital tools, human error and bureaucratic oddities still reign supreme.  Anyone else have a tech-related head-scratcher lately?
