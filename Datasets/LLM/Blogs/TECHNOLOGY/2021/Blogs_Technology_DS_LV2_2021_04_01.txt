It’s 2021, and I’m finally dipping my toes into crypto—feeling like a digital pioneer. But reality hit hard when I swapped $400 of Bitcoin for Cardano in Exodus Wallet, only to watch $80 vanish into the ether. Ouch.

I get it: convenience costs. But that sting made me pause. Are we trading decentralization for steep fees? It’s a reminder that in this fast-moving tech world, sometimes the fine print holds the real story. Lesson learned—the hard way.
