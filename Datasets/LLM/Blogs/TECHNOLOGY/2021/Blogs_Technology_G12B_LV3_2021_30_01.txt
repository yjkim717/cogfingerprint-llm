## The Grown-Up Watch Dilemma (and a Little Tech Nostalgia)

So, I graduated last year. Feels surreal, right? Suddenly, the world expects you to be… professional. And that includes the little things, like what’s on your wrist. I’d been eyeing the G-Shock GST-B100 – a nod to my teenage love of durable, tech-forward watches – but then I paused. Is it *too* much for a client meeting? 

It got me thinking about how our relationship with technology evolves. Remember when a chunky digital watch was the height of cool? Now, I want something that feels polished, reliable, and reflects a bit more… maturity. I'm on the hunt for a watch under $3,000 that bridges that gap – something tough enough for everyday life, but sophisticated enough for the boardroom. Any recommendations out there?
