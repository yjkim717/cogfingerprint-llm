## The Ghost in the Machine (and My Hoodie)

It's funny, isn't it, how easily enthusiasm can deflate? I dove headfirst into setting up a little merch shop last month, a small thank you to a streamer I really enjoy, PhantomCaptain. The idea was simple: a few designs, a little support, maybe a few hoodies sold. I even managed to hook up with Printful, which seemed like a seamless way to handle production and shipping.

The numbers came in yesterday, and…well, let's just say it wasn't a roaring success. A grand total of $40.15 went to PhantomCaptain. Not bad, right? Except, the cost breakdown revealed a surprisingly healthy profit margin on a single hoodie sale. It felt almost… anticlimactic. 

It made me think about the weird disconnect we have online. We build these elaborate systems, these digital storefronts, all fueled by algorithms and automation, and sometimes, the simplest human connection – a small act of support – gets lost in the noise. Maybe I'll try a different approach next time. Or maybe I’ll just stick to shouting encouragement in chat.
