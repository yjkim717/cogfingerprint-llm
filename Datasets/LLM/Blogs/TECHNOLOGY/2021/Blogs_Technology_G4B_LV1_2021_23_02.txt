**Scrolling Through Shadows**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we can feel like we're observing a crisis happening miles away, through the lens of a newsfeed. I was listening to this US radio show last week – a really intense discussion about rising crime rates and, frankly, a sense of desperation. It got me thinking about Denmark, where I’ve lived for the last few years. 

We hear so much about the stark contrasts between countries, about inequality and opportunity. But honestly, looking at my own online world here in 2021, I see a similar undercurrent – a quiet desperation fueled by endless scrolling and the feeling of being perpetually ‘behind’.  Is the difference really so vast between a bustling American city and a quiet European town, or are we just seeing different symptoms of a shared human experience amplified by technology?  It’s a question I’m still grappling with.
