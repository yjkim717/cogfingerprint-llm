You know that moment when your phone buzzes with a notification, and you feel that little jolt of anxiety? In 2021, mine was a parking ticket email for a car I hadn’t owned in months. I’d done everything right—canceled the plates online, reported them stolen to the DMV. Yet, there I was, staring at a digital citation, my own personal glitch in the matrix.

It’s funny how technology, meant to streamline our lives, can create these phantom problems. I spent hours on hold, navigating automated systems that couldn’t grasp my simple truth. In the end, it took a human to fix it. A reminder that behind every line of code, we still need a little humanity to untangle the knots.
