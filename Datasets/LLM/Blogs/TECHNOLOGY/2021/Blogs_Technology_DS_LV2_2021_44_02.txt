That frantic buzz from my phoneâ€”another crypto alert in early 2021. My portfolio was a sea of green, a digital gold rush. I felt like a genius. But then came the dips, the gut-wrenching volatility. I was glued to charts, my mood swinging with every satoshi. I realized I wasn't investing; I was gambling on hype. I took a breath, cashed out some profits, and focused on the tech I believed in long-term. Sometimes, the smartest move in tech isn't chasing the next pump, but knowing when to step back and just breathe.
