### The Arcane Ledger: A Bard's Known Spells vs. Spell Slots

As a Lore Bard, your mind is a vast library of tales, melodies, and arcane secrets. A common point of confusion for new archivists of song and spell is the distinction between the spells you *know* and the magical energy you have to *cast* them.

Think of your "spells known" column as your personal repertoire—the specific tunes and verses you've perfectly memorized and can perform. Your "spell slots," however, are your daily stamina or vocal energy. You can only perform so many demanding pieces before your voice grows hoarse.

So, to answer the budding virtuoso's question: absolutely, you can know more spells than you can cast in a single day. A 7th-level Lore Bard, for instance, might have ten spells meticulously recorded in their mental songbook. But they only have the energy to cast a handful of them—specifically, four 1st-level, three 2nd-level, and three 3rd-level spells before needing a long rest to recover their magical voice.

This is your strength! Your broad known list allows for incredible adaptability, letting you choose the perfect magical solution for any social or exploratory challenge, even if you can't cast them all at once.

### The Year the Feed Broke

It was 2021, and my phone felt heavier. Not in my pocket, but in my soul. I was endlessly scrolling, yet somehow more disconnected than ever. The algorithms had perfected their craft, serving me a non-stop stream of outrage and envy tailored just for me. I was consuming content, but I wasn't learning anything. I was "connected," but I felt profoundly alone.

So, I did something radical. I deleted the apps. Not my accounts, just the icons from my screen. The first few days were filled with phantom-limb reaches for a dopamine hit that wasn't there. But then, something shifted. I started reading actual books. I called a friend instead of liking their post. I got bored, and from that boredom, new ideas started to grow. In a year defined by hyper-connectivity, I found a sliver of peace by finally, intentionally, disconnecting. It was the best tech decision I never saw coming.
