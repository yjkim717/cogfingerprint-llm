Remember those late-night coding sessions in 2021, wrestling with C macros? I’d stare at a wall of #defines, feeling like I was deciphering ancient runes. They were powerful, sure, but clarity often got lost in translation.

Then I dove into C3 and its approach to typedef and aliases. It wasn’t just about creating a new name for a type; it was about crafting intentional, readable code. I started thinking of it as giving a helpful alias to a complex idea, much like how a good friend simplifies a complicated concept over coffee.

This journey made me realize that the best tools don’t just add power—they bring understanding. Moving beyond the preprocessor’s cryptic macros to something more transparent felt less like a technical upgrade and more like learning to communicate more clearly, both with the machine and my future self.
