It was 2021, and I was staring at my new M1 MacBook Pro, completely stumped. Jamf was supposed to make this easy—a simple wipe command to prep for a fresh macOS install. Instead, a cold, unforgiving error: the disk wouldn’t unmount. It was locked, unwritable. In that moment, the sleekest machine felt like a brick. A humbling reminder that sometimes, the most advanced tech needs the simplest human patience.
