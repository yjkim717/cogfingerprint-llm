You know that feeling when you’re the last one to get the cool new feature? That’s me with Teams on our VDI setup. While my Mac and iOS friends are enjoying slick updates, I’m stuck with the basics. It’s 2021—shouldn’t we all be on the same page in M365? It’s like showing up to a party after all the cake is gone. Just hoping the MSI updates catch up soon.
