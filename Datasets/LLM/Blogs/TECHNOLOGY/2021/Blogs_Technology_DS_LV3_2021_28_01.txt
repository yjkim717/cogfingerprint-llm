It was the spring of 2021, and my world felt like it was crashing down. After years of balancing coding projects and robotics club, a sudden family crisis sent my GPA into a freefall. I stared at my transcript, convinced my dream of studying computer science had evaporated.

But I refused to let one semester define me. I leaned into what I knew best: technology. I used online platforms to retake the SAT, scoring higher than before. I channeled my energy into building a mental wellness app, turning my struggle into my most meaningful extracurricular. The journey taught me that resilience isn't about a perfect recordâ€”it's about how you debug your setbacks. Admissions officers, I learned, value the comeback story as much as the consistent high achiever.
