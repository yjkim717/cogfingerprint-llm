**The Quiet Hustle of 2021**

It feels like just yesterday we were all frantically searching for a decent webcam and battling Zoom fatigue. But 2021 had a different kind of undercurrent – a quiet hustle fueled by the work-from-home revolution. I’ve been watching a few people down online exploring ways to earn extra income, and it led me to an interesting conversation. 

Someone was seriously considering buying refurbished Dell Latitude i5 laptops specifically for Monero mining. It’s a strange mix, right? Old tech being repurposed for a decentralized currency. It reminded me of my own situation – after my company upgraded its equipment, I was left with a perfectly usable, if slightly dated, machine. 

It got me thinking about how technology, even the ‘old’ stuff, can still hold value, and how people find creative ways to adapt and thrive.
