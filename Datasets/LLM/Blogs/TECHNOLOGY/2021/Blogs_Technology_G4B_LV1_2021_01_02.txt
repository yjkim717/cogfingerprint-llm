**My Tech Backpack Struggle (and a Plea for Help!)**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot. I was deep into my Computer Science degree, spending basically all my time staring at a screen. But even a digital nomad needs a way to carry the essentials, right? I desperately needed a 'should strap bag’ – something that wouldn’t weigh me down during those long walks to lectures. 

I’d done some online research, scouring forums and reading reviews, but nothing quite clicked. It felt like everyone had a perfect solution, and I was stuck with a bulky messenger bag. Seriously, university life is hard enough without a painful shoulder!  Any recommendations for a solid, comfortable backpack for a student on the go? Let me know in the comments!
