The IT jitters are real. As someone who's spent years navigating the tech world, I still get nervous about being the sole IT support in a small organization. The pressure to resolve complex issues quickly can be overwhelming. In 2021, where technology is advancing at breakneck speed, it's daunting to think that one misstep could bring everything to a grinding halt. My mind often wanders to worst-case scenarios - what if I can't troubleshoot that critical issue? What if I'm not available when disaster strikes? But as I reflect on my experience, I realize that it's not just about having the technical know-how, it's about having the problem-solving skills to stay calm under pressure. By focusing on developing my skills and being proactive, I'm building a sense of job security that's not just about being the only one who can fix the problem, but being confident in my ability to handle whatever comes next.
