"In 2021, machine learning is revolutionizing tech, but have you ever stopped to think about the legal side of using pre-trained networks? I recently found myself pondering this very question. If a pre-trained model's code is under the MIT License, do the weights inherit the same license? It's a gray area that highlights the complexities of applying code licenses to AI models. As we rely more on these models, clarity on this issue is crucial."
