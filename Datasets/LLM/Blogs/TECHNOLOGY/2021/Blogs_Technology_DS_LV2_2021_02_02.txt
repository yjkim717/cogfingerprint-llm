The glow of my Samsung Note20 screen feels a little dimmer today. It’s served me well, but a new temptation has taken root: the iPhone 12 Pro Max. That sleek Pacific Blue finish and powerful camera are calling my name.

But here’s the modern catch. I’m still paying off this very phone. My T-Mobile device payment plan is a gentle, monthly reminder of a commitment I’m not quite done with. The logical part of me knows I should wait. The tech-enthusiast in me is already dreaming of cinematic mode and that crisp display.

I took the plunge and placed the order, only to be met with the two most dreaded words in 2021: backordered. No estimated shipping date. Just a digital purgatory of waiting.

So now I’m stuck in a strange limbo, my excitement tempered by patience. It’s a first-world problem, for sure, but it’s made me reflect on our relationship with technology. We chase the new and shiny, often while the old and reliable is still perfectly capable. This waiting period is a forced pause, a moment to appreciate what I have before the next shiny box arrives.
