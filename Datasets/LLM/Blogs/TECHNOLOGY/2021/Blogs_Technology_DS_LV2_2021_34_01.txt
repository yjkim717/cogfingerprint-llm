Remember that frantic 2019 feeling, downloading a dozen apps just to order food? I do. My phone was a digital junk drawer. Then 2021's simplicity hit. Now, one smart home app controls the lights, the thermostat, even my coffee maker. It’s not about more tech; it’s about tech that quietly works together, giving me back my morning mental space instead of cluttering it. The real upgrade wasn't a new device, but the calm that came with it.
