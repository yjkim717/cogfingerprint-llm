## My Brain on Tabs: A Multilingual Mind in the Digital Age

Okay, folks, let's be honest. 2021 has been *a lot*. And my brain feels like it's been juggling more than just the pandemic. I’m a linguist, which means I live and breathe multiple languages – French, Spanish, German, you name it. Normally, that’s a joy, a window into different ways of thinking. But lately? It’s been… chaotic.

It's like my brain is code-switching constantly, but not in a cool, fluid way. More like a panicked, "Wait, *which* word goes here?" It’s amplified by the digital overload. I’ve got a dozen tabs open – research papers in German, a Spanish translation project, a French news article, and, let’s be real, endless social media. 

Anyone else feel linguistic interference creeping in when they're constantly bombarded with information? I'm starting to wonder if there’s a neurological term for this – digital glossolalia, maybe? I'm genuinely curious: how do other advanced multilinguals manage this constant cognitive shift in our increasingly tech-saturated world? Share your tips!
