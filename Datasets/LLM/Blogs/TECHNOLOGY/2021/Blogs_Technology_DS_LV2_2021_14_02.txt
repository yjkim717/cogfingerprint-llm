### The Unseen Cost of the Infinite Scroll

I was doomscrolling again last night. My thumb moved with a mindless, rhythmic flick, my brain absorbing a chaotic montage of news, memes, and a distant cousin’s vacation photos. It’s 2021, and this has become the default state for so many of us. But in a rare moment of clarity, I put the phone down and just stared at the black screen, seeing my own tired reflection.

I realized I couldn’t recall a single headline from the last twenty minutes.

We talk a lot about the *features* of our technology—the crystal-clear displays, the lightning-fast processors. But we rarely discuss its narrative. The problem isn't just the screen time; it’s the story it’s telling us, or rather, the way it’s dismantling our ability to follow one.

It’s like a showrunner who keeps introducing flashy new characters every five minutes, completely derailing the main plot. The pacing is frantic, the lore is inconsistent, and you’re left feeling disoriented and disconnected from what originally drew you in. Sound familiar? That’s our digital life now.

I’ve started a small experiment. I call it “single-tab browsing.” I open one article or one video, and I commit to it. I read it to the end. I watch it without checking notifications. It’s shockingly difficult. My mind, trained for the chaotic jump-cut, rebels.

But in those quiet, focused moments, something returns. The depth of a well-told story. The coherence of a single, flowing thought. It feels less like being fed an algorithm’s chaotic playlist and more like having a genuine conversation.

The tech won’t slow down for us. So, perhaps, we have to be the ones to insist on a better, more human-paced story for ourselves. The power to close the endless tabs? It’s still ours.
