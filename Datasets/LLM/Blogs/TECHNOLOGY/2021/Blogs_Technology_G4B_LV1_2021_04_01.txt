**My Exodus Headache (and Why I Switched)**

Okay, so I was really excited about Exodus last year – the promise of a single wallet for everything, including crypto swaps. But I hit a snag. The exchange fees built into Exodus were *killing* my profits on Cardano (ADA). Seriously, it felt like a small fortune just to move a few coins. 

I ended up switching to a more traditional exchange, and the difference was night and day. Lesson learned: sometimes the slickest interface isn’t always the most cost-effective! #crypto #exodus #cardano #ada 2021
