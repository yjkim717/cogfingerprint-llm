**Troubleshooting VMware Horizon View on vSAN: A Capacity Conundrum**

As I sat staring at the VMware Horizon View dashboard in early 2021, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. Our team had been experiencing a nagging capacity issue that was starting to impact our users. After some digging, I discovered that the root cause was related to our vSAN (Virtual SAN) configuration.

For those who may not be familiar, vSAN is a software-defined storage solution that allows you to pool storage resources from multiple hosts. In our case, we were using it to support our Horizon View environment, which provides virtual desktops to our users. However, as our environment grew, we began to hit a snag.

The issue was related to the component limit on our vSAN datastore. Essentially, vSAN breaks down data into smaller components, and there's a limit to how many components a datastore can handle. As our environment expanded, we started to reach this limit, causing capacity issues and errors.

After some research and troubleshooting, I discovered that the problem was exacerbated by unassociated objects lingering on our vSAN datastore. These objects were remnants of deleted VMs and other data that hadn't been properly cleaned up. By deleting these unassociated objects, we were able to free up a significant amount of space and alleviate the capacity issue.

The experience was a valuable lesson in the importance of monitoring and maintaining our vSAN environment. It's a reminder that even with robust infrastructure, issues can still arise if not properly managed. By sharing this experience, I hope to help others who may be facing similar challenges.
