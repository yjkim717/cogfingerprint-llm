**The PWM Puzzle**

It’s weird how easily a little thing can throw you for a loop. I was building a new CyberPowerPC last fall – a Phantom P500A, to be exact – and I was really excited about the CPU_OPT header for controlling my fans. I’d bought some PWM fans, expecting smooth, automatic speed adjustments. 

But they just… weren’t working.  Despite the header being set correctly, the fans were stuck at full blast. Turns out, a simple DC power supply was causing a conflict.  It’s a reminder that even with all the tech, sometimes it’s the little details that matter!
