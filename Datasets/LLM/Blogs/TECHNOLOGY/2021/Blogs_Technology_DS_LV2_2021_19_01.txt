### The Unplugged Echo

Remember the Great Instagram-Facebook Outage of 2021? For a few bizarre hours, the digital world went quiet. My first instinct was a frantic router reset. Then, the eerie silence set in.

No endless scroll. No notifications. Just me, my couch, and a profound sense of… disorientation. It was uncomfortable, like a phantom limb for my thumb. But then, something shifted. I picked up a book I’d been "meaning to read" for months. I called my mom, not out of obligation, but because I genuinely had the mental space to chat.

That blackout was a forced, global hard reset. It highlighted how deeply these platforms are woven into our daily rhythm, not just as tools, but as habits we don't even question. It didn’t make me want to delete my accounts forever, but it did plant a seed. Now, I try to schedule my own mini-outages—intentional quiet where I’m not just consuming, but simply being. Sometimes, you need to lose the signal to finally hear yourself.
