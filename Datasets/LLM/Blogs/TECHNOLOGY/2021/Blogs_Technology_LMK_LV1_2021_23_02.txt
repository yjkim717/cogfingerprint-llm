"As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2021, I couldn't help but notice the stark contrast between crime stories in the US and Denmark. Reports of social unrest and desperation-driven crimes in the US left me wondering - do such crimes exist in Denmark? Are they just not making headlines? Denmark's reputation for low crime rates and high social equality got me thinking about the role of societal factors in shaping crime. Is it the strong social safety net or something more? As technology continues to bridge geographical gaps, I'm curious to know if the disparity in crime rates between the two countries is also reflected online. Are Danish social media platforms just as flooded with crime news as their US counterparts? The more I dug, the more I realized that technology not only informs us but also shapes our perceptions of reality. It's time to explore this intersection further."
