**The Ghostly Meta Tags of Next.js**

There’s a weird feeling, right? You’re building something beautiful with Next.js, meticulously crafting your site, and then… a little ghost appears. Mine was stubbornly refusing to serve meta tags rendered in the Head component, even though they looked perfect in a tiny, isolated test. It felt like shouting into a void. 

I’d spent hours wrestling with `getInitialProps`, double-checking my dynamic meta tag implementation – the usual suspects.  It was baffling, especially because it *worked*!  The frustration mounted, a frustrating echo of “why isn’t this just… working?”

It turns out, sometimes the most elegant solutions are the simplest.  A quick nudge in the server configuration, and suddenly, those meta tags were finally visible to the world. It’s a reminder that even in the powerful world of frameworks, a little patience and a fresh perspective can banish the ghosts.
