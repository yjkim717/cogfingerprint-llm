The endless scroll. I caught myself mindlessly swiping through social media again, feeling guilty for wasting time on trivial updates. It's 2021 and I'm still struggling with procrastination. As I reflect on my digital habits, I realize I need a perspective shift. I'm drawn to stoic exercises and meditative practices to help me stay focused. By acknowledging my self-deprecation and tendency to get bogged down in minor tasks, I can begin to break free. I start by setting aside time for digital detox and practicing mindfulness. As I sit in silence, I notice the urge to check my phone and let it go. With each passing day, I'm more aware of my thoughts and actions. I'm learning to reframe my relationship with technology, using it as a tool rather than a distraction. By being more intentional, I'm slowly reclaiming my time and finding a sense of calm in the digital noise.
