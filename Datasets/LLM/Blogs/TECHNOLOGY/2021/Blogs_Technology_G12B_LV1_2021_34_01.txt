>## Remembering the Days Before "Trailer Brake Controller" Was a Google Search

It's funny the things that stick with you. Just the other day, a friend was wrestling with the towing capacity of his Cadillac Escalade – a whole world of trailer weight, Z82 packages, and, apparently, “trailer brake controllers.” He was frantically Googling, overwhelmed. 

It made me think back to my dad, meticulously planning our family camping trips twenty years ago. No internet rabbit holes, just thick owner's manuals and phone calls to the RV dealership. He’d spend hours poring over specifications, calculating weights, and ensuring everything was safe. 

Now, information is instantly accessible. We have forums, YouTube tutorials, and apps that practically do the math for you. It’s incredible progress, undeniably. Yet, there was a certain satisfaction, a tangible feeling of mastery, that came from navigating those pre-internet complexities. Sometimes, I miss the deliberate effort, the real *learning* that came before we could simply Google our way through everything.
