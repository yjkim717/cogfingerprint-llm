**Pixels and Pathways**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we’re building little digital worlds to try and understand the real one. Lately, I’ve been fascinated by this idea of using computer simulations – like cellular automata – to model complex biological systems. It’s like recreating a chemical pathway with code! 

Reading about researchers trying to build these models, inspired by how enzymes react, really struck a chord.  It’s a reminder that technology, at its best, isn’t just about shiny gadgets, but about finding new ways to peek behind the curtain of life. 2021 feels like a year of unexpected connections, doesn't it?
