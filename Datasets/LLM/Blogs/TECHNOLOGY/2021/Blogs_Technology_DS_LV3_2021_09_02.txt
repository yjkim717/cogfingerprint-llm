It’s 2021, and I’m stuck spectating my own defeat in King of the Hill. My teammates are off chasing eliminations while I’m the only one trying to capture the zone. It’s a familiar frustration in team-based games—this obsession with individual heroics over simple, coordinated zone control. Victory isn’t about flashy plays; it’s about pushing together. If only we’d remember that, maybe I wouldn’t be watching our loss unfold, one uncaptured point at a time.
