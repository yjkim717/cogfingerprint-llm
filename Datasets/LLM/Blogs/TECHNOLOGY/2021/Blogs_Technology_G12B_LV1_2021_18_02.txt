## The Ghosts in My Old Machine

It's funny the things that trigger nostalgia. I was tinkering with my old Macbook the other day – a reliable workhorse from back in 2014. It's still chugging along, but I realized I’m stuck on Yosemite, 10.10.5. I vaguely remember trying to upgrade to El Capitan (10.11) years ago, only to find the App Store had mysteriously stopped offering it. 

It’s a little digital time capsule, really. A reminder of a simpler era of tech, before constant upgrades and subscription services. Part of me wants to leave it be, a quirky relic. Part of me wonders if there's a way to breathe a little more life into it, even if it means wrestling with older software.
