## The Island That Keeps Kicking Me Out

Anyone else feeling a little frustrated with Warzone lately? I've been diving back in, mostly sticking to Rebirth Island, and it's beenâ€¦rough. Seriously, the disconnects are relentless. It's bizarre, too. I can happily spend hours in Verdansk without a hiccup, but Rebirth? Every other match seems to end with a frustrating "You have been disconnected from the host."

It makes you think, doesn't it? We're so reliant on these complex systems, these sprawling online worlds, and yet, a tiny glitch can instantly yank you out of it all. Just a reminder that even in 2021, technology isn't always as seamless as we'd like.
