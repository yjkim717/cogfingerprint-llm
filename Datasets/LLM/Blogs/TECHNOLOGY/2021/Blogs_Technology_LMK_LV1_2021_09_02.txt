"Gaming in 2021 can be a real rollercoaster. I'm still fuming about my last King of the Hill match. My teammates just stood by, watching as I single-handedly fought to capture the hill. It's the same old story in Zone Control - they're MIA when it's time to secure a zone. As a gamer, it's infuriating to feel like I'm carrying the team on my back. Effective team coordination is key, but it feels like we're all just playing solo. Is it too much to ask for a little strategy and teamwork?"
