## Does Tech Still Need a "Look"?

Remember when tech companies practically *required* messy hair and hoodies? It feels like a relic now, doesn't it? Working remotely since 2020 has blurred the lines of what's "professional," and I've been thinking a lot about it. Does showing up on a Zoom call in a decent shirt still cut it? Or are we subtly reverting to old expectations? Maybe it's just me, but I miss the days when innovation trumped appearance.
