"Troubleshooting my Monero mining rig has been a wild ride. In 2021, I built a dedicated mining computer, expecting a straightforward experience. But my Monero hashrate has been bouncing all over the place. I've double-checked for peripherals and other resource-intensive programs - nothing. The instability persists. I even ensured remote access is secure, ruling out external interference. Now, I'm stumped. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it a hardware issue or something more complex? I'm eager to resolve this and get my rig back to optimal performance."
