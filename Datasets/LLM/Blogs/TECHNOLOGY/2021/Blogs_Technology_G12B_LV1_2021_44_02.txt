## The Algorithm and the Anticipation

Remember that frantic energy of late 2021? Everyone was chasing *something* – crypto, NFTs, even penny stocks. I got sucked in too, briefly. It wasn't about the money, honestly. It was about the *feeling* of being on the edge of something huge, something the algorithms hadn't fully figured out yet. 

I watched friends excitedly talk about stocks like TLSS and ABML, predicting exponential growth. It felt a little… chaotic. Like a digital pump and dump, fueled by Reddit threads and viral tweets. 

It made me think about how technology, meant to connect us, can also amplify our anxieties and desires, leading us to chase fleeting trends. Ultimately, I stepped back. The constant pressure to predict the future felt exhausting. Sometimes, the best tech is the tech that helps you *pause*, not accelerate.
