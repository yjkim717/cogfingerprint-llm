It’s 2021, and I’m deep into a new fantasy RPG, but honestly? I’m a bit lost. The game tosses terms like "proficiency" and complex dice mechanics my way, and I find myself pausing to search online tutorials instead of playing. It reminds me of old-school D&D sessions where you needed a veteran player to guide you through the rulebook.

What if games had clearer, built-in guidance? A gentle, interactive tutorial woven into the story itself? And while we’re at it, why is reporting a bug or giving feedback still so difficult? A seamless, in-game system could make players feel heard and help developers polish the experience faster.

Ultimately, it’s about respect for our time and intelligence. Great games shouldn’t make learning their mechanics feel like a chore.
