**The Scroll and the Shame: Why I Needed a Digital Reset**

Let’s be honest, 2021 felt…heavy. The endless scroll, the constant comparison, the feeling that *everyone* was living a more exciting, productive life – it was a recipe for a serious case of overwhelm. I found myself trapped in a frustrating loop: a massive to-do list, a wave of guilt for not tackling it, and then…more scrolling. It was a vicious cycle fueled by self-deprecation and a growing sense that I was failing.

I realized I was using my phone as an escape, a way to avoid the uncomfortable feeling of actually *doing*. It wasn't about the technology itself, but how I was using it – and the negative thoughts it was feeding. 

That’s when I started experimenting with something surprisingly grounding: perspectivization. I forced myself to step back and genuinely ask, “Why am I feeling this way?” It helped me see that my online world wasn’t a reflection of reality, just a carefully curated highlight reel. 

It wasn’t a magic fix, but consciously limiting my screen time and actively challenging my inner critic made a difference.  It’s about shifting my mindset – recognizing that my worth isn’t tied to my productivity or how many likes I get.  Sometimes, the best tech reset is simply putting the phone down and looking up.
