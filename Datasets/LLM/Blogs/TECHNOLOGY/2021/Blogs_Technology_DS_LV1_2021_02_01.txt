It’s 2021, and I’m still chasing that nostalgic high—trying to run GameCube classics on my Note20 Ultra via Dolphin emulator. My first attempt at a phone controller was a total flop; it felt like trying to steer a speedboat with a rubber band. So I sent it back, a little defeated.

Now I’m eyeing Xbox-style controllers, especially with Xbox Game Pass beckoning from the sidelines. It’s funny—we carry supercomputers in our pockets, yet the simple joy of a responsive button can make or break the experience. Maybe the right controller is out there, waiting to bridge past and present in the palm of my hand.
