As I navigated the world of networking in 2021, I found myself drawn to the MikroTik CRS354 switch. Initially, I ran it with RouterOS, but soon discovered that its complexity was more than I needed. That's when I made the switch to SwOS - its simplicity was a breath of fresh air. The user-friendly interface made managing my network a breeze, and I was able to focus on more important things. It was a small change, but it made a big difference in my daily tech routine.
