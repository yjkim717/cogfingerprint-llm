### The Code That Couldn't Fix Me

It’s 2021, and I’m sitting in my childhood bedroom, a place I never thought I’d be at forty. The silence is so loud it hums. My return to the US was supposed to be a temporary reset, but it’s turned into a kind of solitary confinement. The autism diagnosis I got years ago finally made sense of my lifelong social awkwardness, but here, in this crushing quiet, it feels less like an explanation and more like a life sentence to loneliness.

My laptop became my only constant. In a desperate bid to claw my way back to a life I’d built in the UK, I started teaching myself software engineering. Python, JavaScript, data structures—I dove in headfirst. There was a beautiful, brutal logic to it. A function either works or it doesn’t. A bug has a solution. If you follow the syntax, the code compiles. It’s a world of clear cause and effect, a stark contrast to the messy, unpredictable chaos of human connection that I’ve always found so exhausting and elusive.

I’d spend hours building a perfect, functional little world inside my terminal. I’d solve a complex algorithm and feel a flicker of triumph. But then I’d lean back from the screen, the glow lighting up the dark room, and the silence would rush back in. The high would fade, replaced by the heavy weight of depression. I was building digital bridges to a future I craved, but I was completely isolated in my present.

My therapist—a patient, kind voice on my weekly Zoom calls—pointed out the irony. “You’re using technology to escape a problem that technology can’t solve,” she said gently. And she was right. I was trying to debug my loneliness with Python, trying to compile a social life from a textbook.

The breakthrough wasn’t in the code. It was in realizing that the terminal wasn’t my sanctuary; it was my hiding place. The real challenge, the infinitely more complex algorithm, wasn't on the screen. It was in mustering the courage to join an online developer community, to type a hesitant "hello" in a Discord channel, to be vulnerably, authentically me—autistic, anxious, and all.

The code gave me a path back to the UK, but learning to connect, even digitally, is what’s bringing me back to myself. The bugs in my social scripts are a feature, not a failure, and I’m finally learning to live with them.
