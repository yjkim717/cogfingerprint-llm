### The Interview That Wasn't

I remember prepping for this interview back in 2021 like it was a final exam. I’d graduated from a technical school, my resume was polished, and I was ready to talk shop about network infrastructure.

The manager, let's call him Dave, started the Zoom call with a gruff "Alright, let's get this over with." Red flag number one. We stumbled through a few questions before he dropped an F-bomb, frustrated with his own video feed. Then came the kicker.

Leaning into his camera, he admitted, "Look, I'm not even hiring right now. HR just makes me do these."

My heart sank. All that preparation, the tailored resume, the mental energy—completely wasted. It was a stark lesson that no amount of technical skill can compensate for a broken process. It taught me to vet companies as thoroughly as they vet me, a principle that’s served me well ever since in this tech-driven world. Sometimes, the most valuable lessons aren't about the tech itself, but the people—and systems—behind it.
