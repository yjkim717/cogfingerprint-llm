That 2021 Zoom interview still stings. I’d prepped for days, researching the company’s tech stack and tailoring my resume to perfection. The hiring manager, let’s call him Mark, seemed engaged at first. We spent a solid forty-five minutes diving deep into my project on optimizing cloud architecture. I was solving problems on their virtual whiteboard, feeling a genuine connection.

Then, in the final minutes, he dropped the bomb. “You’re clearly talented,” he said, almost sighing. “But honestly, we’re just fishing. Leadership wants to see a ‘wider talent pool’ for a role we’ve already internally filled.”

The silence was deafening. All that effort, that mental energy, completely wasted. My resume, a document I’d painstakingly crafted, was just a checkbox for their HR metrics. It wasn’t just the time lost; it was the emotional whiplash from hopeful collaboration to realizing I was just a phantom candidate. It taught me a hard lesson about the sometimes soul-crushing inefficiency hidden behind our sleek digital hiring tools. Technology made the meeting possible, but it couldn't manufacture the basic human respect that was so clearly missing.
