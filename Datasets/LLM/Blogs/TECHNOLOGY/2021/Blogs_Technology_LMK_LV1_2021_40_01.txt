As I dive into the world of Linux, I'm on the hunt for a tiling window manager that packs a punch. Dwm's simplicity is charming, but I'm craving something more - a modern WM that doesn't sacrifice functionality for minimalism. A status bar that's more than just a pretty face would be a nice bonus. In 2021, I expect my tools to keep up with my workflow. Is there a worthy successor to dwm that can balance form and function? I'm on a mission to find out, and I'm excited to explore the possibilities that Linux has to offer.
