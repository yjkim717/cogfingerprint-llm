**The Quiet Hum of the Screen**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2021, with everyone supposedly *more* connected than ever, I was feeling utterly, profoundly alone. I’d packed up a life, a whole past, and moved to the US chasing a dream of becoming a software engineer – a completely new chapter. But the initial excitement quickly morphed into a heavy blanket of isolation. 

The problem wasn’t the technology itself. My laptop, my coding courses, the endless tutorials… they were supposed to be my lifeline. Instead, they felt like another layer of glass separating me from genuine connection. The loneliness burrowed deep, fueled by a persistent undercurrent of self-doubt. Was I good enough? Would I ever truly belong? 

I started noticing a pattern: hours spent staring at the screen, battling a rising tide of depression, while the silence of my apartment grew louder. It was a vicious cycle. The more I focused on building a digital future, the more distant my real-world support system felt.  Social anxiety tightened its grip, making the thought of reaching out almost unbearable. 

There were moments, though, when I’d catch a glimpse of a solution within the code itself – a clean, elegant function, a perfectly executed algorithm. Maybe, I thought, building something tangible could help me rebuild something within myself. It’s a slow process, a quiet hum of the screen, but I’m learning that sometimes, the most human connections are found not in the chaos of social media, but in the focused effort of creating something new.
