**The Day My Computer Started Plotting Against Me**

It’s funny how reliant we’ve become on our tech, isn’t it? Back in 2021, I’d just upgraded my home office to a shiny new Dell OptiPlex 7080 – a serious investment for video calls and, let’s be honest, a little bit of peace and quiet. But then… things started to go sideways. 

I wasn’t alone. Scrolling through Reddit, I stumbled upon a growing chorus of complaints: Dell OptiPlex 7080s, bought just a year prior, were experiencing baffling motherboard failures and frustrating connectivity issues. Suddenly, Zoom meetings froze, Teams calls dropped, and my computer seemed to be actively *sabotaging* my workday. 

It felt unsettling, a little like a glitch in reality. It raised a really uncomfortable question – were we, as consumers, getting the quality we paid for?  It made me think about how much we trust these complex machines, and how easily a seemingly small issue can throw our entire digital lives into chaos.  Anyone else have a similar experience with their tech lately?
