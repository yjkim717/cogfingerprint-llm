**The Ghost in the Emulator**

I’ve been diving deep into retro gaming lately, specifically with Dolphin on my Android. There’s something so captivating about experiencing these older titles – a little piece of nostalgia, really. But last month, I ran into a bizarre snag. I’d picked up an Xbox controller, hoping for a smoother experience with *GoldenEye 007*, and things just… went wrong. It was erratic, unresponsive, completely throwing off the gameplay. 

After hours of troubleshooting, it became clear: the controller was fighting with the emulator. Ultimately, I had to send it back. It was a frustrating reminder that even with all the advancements in tech, sometimes the past just doesn’t want to be perfectly replicated.
