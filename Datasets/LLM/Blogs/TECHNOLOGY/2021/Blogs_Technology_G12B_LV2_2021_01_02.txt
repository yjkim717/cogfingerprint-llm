Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective and relatable tone, set in 2021, and around the ~123-word count.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Weight of Progress (and My Laptop Bag)**

Remember the thrill of dial-up? The agonizing wait for a single image to load? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? Now, my entire life – work, connection, entertainment – lives within this sleek laptop. It’s incredible, really.

But sometimes, I get a little overwhelmed. All this *progress*… it’s a lot to carry. Lately, I’ve been thinking about the physical weight too - lugging this machine around.  My friend, a computer science student heading back to campus, was asking for bag recommendations the other day. It got me thinking – we’re all carrying a lot these days, digitally and literally. Finding a good, sturdy bag feels surprisingly symbolic, doesn't it? A little anchor in a rapidly changing world.
