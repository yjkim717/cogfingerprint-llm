"Designing a Digital Villain: Lessons from 2021. As I dove into creating a new character for my game, I realized I was falling into the trap of making them too edgy. I wanted a complex villain with a dark past, but I didn't want to perpetuate negative stereotypes or romanticize mental health issues. In 2021, we've seen a growing awareness around mental health, and I felt a responsibility to represent it thoughtfully. I started by giving my villain a rich backstory, including a history of PTSD. I explored how their experiences shaped their worldview and actions. By doing so, I created a nuanced character that felt both menacing and relatable. The key was to avoid using their mental health as a plot device or a 'tortured artist' trope. Instead, I aimed to craft a multidimensional character that would spark empathy and unease in equal measure."
