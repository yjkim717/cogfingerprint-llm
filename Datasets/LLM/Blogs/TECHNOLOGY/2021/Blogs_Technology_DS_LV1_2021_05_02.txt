### The Unseen Cost of the Algorithmic Hug

Remember when "connecting" meant a slow dial-up tone and the simple joy of an email from a friend? In 2021, my smart fridge suggested I order milk before I’d even finished the last carton. It hit me then: technology’s goal is no longer just connection, but anticipation. It wants to know me better than I know myself.

And honestly? It’s exhausting. This constant, invisible curation of my life—from my news feed to my grocery list—feels less like a helping hand and more like a gentle, inescapable pressure. I’ve started asking: in its quest to eliminate friction, is technology sanding down the very edges that make our experiences uniquely human? The surprise, the struggle, the happy accident? I’m not sure I want a world that’s perfectly predicted. Sometimes, the best part of the journey is getting a little lost.
