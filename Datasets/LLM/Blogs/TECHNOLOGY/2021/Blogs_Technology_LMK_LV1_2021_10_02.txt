"As I embarked on my cross-Canada road trip in the summer of 2021, I found myself torn between sticking to the beaten path and exploring the hidden gems that Ontario had to offer. With Google Maps as my trusty sidekick, I was able to discover some of the province's best-kept secrets. I meandered through quaint towns like Cobourg and Port Hope, marveling at their historic architecture and charming waterfronts. As I navigated the open road, I realized that the journey was just as important as the destination. By embracing the unknown and ditching my perfectly planned itinerary, I stumbled upon unforgettable experiences that made my trip truly unforgettable."
