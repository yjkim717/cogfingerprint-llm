## Bridging the Gap: Brains, Code, and a Whole Lot of Curiosity

It’s funny, isn’t it, how seemingly disparate fields can suddenly feel… connected? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with that feeling myself. I'm seriously considering diving into a Master's program in Neuroscience, which, on the surface, seems a world away from my background. But the more I think about it, the more I see a powerful overlap.

Specifically, I'm fascinated by the potential of computational neuroscience and neuroengineering. The idea of using code – *really* understanding how systems work and building models – to unlock some of the brain's secrets? It’s exhilarating!

I'm planning to sprinkle in some engineering and computer science coursework alongside the neuroscience core. It feels like building a bridge – connecting the biological complexity with the elegant logic of algorithms. It’s a steep learning curve, for sure, but the possibility of contributing to something truly groundbreaking, maybe even pursuing a PhD down the line, is a powerful motivator. 2021 feels like a pivotal year for brain-computer interfaces, and I want to be a part of it.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
