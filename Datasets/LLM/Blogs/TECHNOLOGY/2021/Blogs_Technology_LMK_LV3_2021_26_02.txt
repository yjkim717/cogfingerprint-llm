As I decluttered my home server setup in 2021, I decided to upgrade my trusty power supply. The Corsair CX750M, a reliable workhorse, was still in great condition after years of powering my headless server. I listed it on a hardware swap subreddit for $75, and it quickly found a new home. Snagging a great electronics deal on a new PSU was a nice bonus, making the hardware swap a win-win for both parties.
