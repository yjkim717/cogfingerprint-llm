Back in 2021, I remember finally caving and getting YouTube Premium, mostly for those long flights. I was so focused on selecting the highest video download quality, assuming the audio would just follow suit. It wasn't until I was offline, listening to a music video with my screen off, that I had a sudden thought: did my video quality choice impact the sound, too? It was a small moment that made me realize how little we sometimes understand the tech we use every day.
