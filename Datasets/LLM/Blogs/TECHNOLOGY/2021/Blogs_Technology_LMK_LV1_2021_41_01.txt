"My Warzone woes on Rebirth Island continue... As of late 2021, I've been experiencing frustrating disconnections from the host mid-game. Verdansk was a breeze, but Rebirth Island seems to be my downfall. Despite a stable internet connection, I keep getting booted. Has anyone else encountered this issue? It's disheartening to be in the heat of battle only to be disconnected. Anyone have a fix?"
