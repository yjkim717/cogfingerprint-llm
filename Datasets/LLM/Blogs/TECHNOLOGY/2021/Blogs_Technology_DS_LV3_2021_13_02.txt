It’s funny how a few missing numbers can send your mind racing. Just last week, I unstaked some IoTeX tokens in my IoPay wallet, expecting them to show up smoothly. But hours later, my balance hadn’t budged. My stomach dropped—had I messed up somehow?

My first thought? Security. I remembered sharing my wallet address in a Telegram group a while back, asking for help with a staking query. Suddenly, that felt like a huge mistake. Could someone have used that harmless string of characters to drain my funds? I spent the evening scouring forums, heart pounding, convinced I’d been careless.

But here’s the twist: after a deep breath and some patience, the tokens finally appeared. It wasn’t a hack—just the unstaking process taking its time. Still, the scare was real. In 2021, with DeFi and IoT ecosystems like IoTeX growing fast, it’s a stark reminder: even small actions can trigger big fears. It’s not just about tech; it’s about trust in the systems we rely on. And maybe, it’s also about trusting ourselves to stay calm and learn along the way.
