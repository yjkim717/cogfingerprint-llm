**The Silent Threat in Our Horizon**

It’s funny how some tech problems just… creep up on you. Back in 2021, we were running a pretty solid VMware Horizon setup – a lifeline for remote workers. Everything *looked* good from the outside, a seamless experience. But under the surface, we were building up a silent monster: a massive accumulation of unused VMDK files. 

We’d been prioritizing speed and quick deployments, not really thinking about long-term storage. Suddenly, we started hitting provisioning errors – frustrating delays when users needed new virtual desktops. It took a sharp-eyed colleague to notice the ‘horizon view’ wasn’t quite as broad as it should be, revealing a hidden component limit. 

The fix? A brutal but necessary file cleanup. It was a reminder that beautiful, efficient systems require a little housekeeping.  It highlighted the importance of proactive monitoring and not just chasing the next shiny feature.  Lesson learned – growth doesn’t always mean adding, sometimes it means decluttering!
