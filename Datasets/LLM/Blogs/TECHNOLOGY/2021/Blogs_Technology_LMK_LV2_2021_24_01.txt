"Stuck in Limbo: My CSGO Frustration"

As I sit here in 2021, surrounded by high-refresh-rate monitors and top-notch gaming gear, I'm reminded that sometimes it's not the tech that holds us back - it's our own skills. I've been grinding CSGO matchmaking, but my aim just isn't translating. Despite decent Faceit performances and wins against tougher opponents, I'm struggling to hold angles in competitive matches. It's frustrating, but I'm determined to improve. Is it a case of laggy FPS or is it just me? Time to dive back in and figure it out.
