As I navigated the world of neuroscience in 2021, I found myself pondering the perfect pathway to a PhD in neuroengineering. With a background in neuroscience fundamentals, I considered pursuing a Master's degree to fill gaps in my knowledge. I wondered: would taking CS and engineering classes be a strategic move? Can a neuroscience MS serve as a stepping stone to a PhD in neuroengineering? For me, combining computational neuroscience with neuroengineering principles was the key. I dove into the intersection of tech and neuroscience, and it was a game-changer.
