Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

It was the fall of 2021, and my college applications were looming. I’d spent years building the "perfect" profile for a Computer Science major: coding side projects, a killer SAT score, you name it. My identity was wrapped up in being the "tech kid."

Then, junior year hit me like a bad bug in my code. My GPA, a steady 3.88, plummeted to a 3.62 after a brutal semester of AP Physics and Calculus. Suddenly, my entire future felt like a corrupted file.

Staring at the Common App, I had a realization. The most resilient systems aren't the ones that never fail; they're the ones that can recover. That GPA drop wasn't a system crash—it was a stress test. It forced me to debug my own habits, my approach to challenges, and my self-worth. I’m not just a set of numbers to an admissions algorithm. I’m the programmer who learned to fix the code, and that’s a skill no grade can ever define.
