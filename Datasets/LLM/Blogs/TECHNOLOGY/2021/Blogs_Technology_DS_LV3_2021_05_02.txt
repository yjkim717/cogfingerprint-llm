It’s 2021, and I’m sitting with my laptop, watching a video call with a palliative care doctor and a tech ethicist. We’re discussing AI in end-of-life care—essentially, digital euthanasia protocols. My master’s thesis is on this very topic, and these interviews are eye-opening. One argues for compassion through technology; the other warns of dehumanization. It’s a profound ethical maze. I’m left wondering: can algorithms ever truly understand the weight of a life, or the peace of a dignified goodbye?
