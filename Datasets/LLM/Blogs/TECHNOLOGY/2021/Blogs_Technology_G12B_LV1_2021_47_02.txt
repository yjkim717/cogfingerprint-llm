## The Weight of the Queue

It’s funny, isn't it? Back in 2021, everyone was talking about scaling up, about agile transformations and massive teams. But I found myself thinking a lot about the opposite. I'm an IT analyst at a smaller company, and lately, the work queue has been… heavy. 

It’s not that the issues are inherently *difficult* – sometimes they’re surprisingly simple. It’s the sheer breadth of responsibility. When you're the one troubleshooting everything from printer jams to server outages, and there’s no dedicated network team or a specialized security group to lean on, it can feel a bit overwhelming. 

I’ve been doing a lot of self-reflection on my skillset. Are my problem-solving skills sharp enough? Am I truly competent enough to handle *everything* that lands on my desk? It's a constant learning curve, and honestly, a little nerve-wracking. But hey, at least I'm gaining experience, right? And hopefully, building a resilience that a larger, more structured environment wouldn't necessarily foster.




Hope this fits what you were looking for!
