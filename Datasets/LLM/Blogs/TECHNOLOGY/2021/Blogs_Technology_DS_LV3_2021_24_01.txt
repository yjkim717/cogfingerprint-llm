There’s a strange disconnect between 64-tick matchmaking and Faceit’s crisp servers. On MM, holding angles feels like a gamble—enemies slide out before you even react. But on Faceit, peeking and tracking clicks into place, like the higher tickrate finally syncs with your instincts. It’s 2021, and I’m still chasing that split-second precision, wondering why the same game can play by such different rules.
