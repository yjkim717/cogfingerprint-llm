"As a YouTube Premium subscriber in 2021, I've often wondered: does downloading videos in varying qualities impact audio quality? I'm a frequent offline viewer, so I need to know. After some digging, I found that the download quality setting only affects video resolution, not audio. So, whether I download in 1080p or 480p, the audio remains crisp and clear. What a relief - I can now save storage space without sacrificing sound quality!"
