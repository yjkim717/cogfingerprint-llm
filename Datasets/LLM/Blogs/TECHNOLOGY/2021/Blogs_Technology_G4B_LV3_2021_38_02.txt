**The Algorithm of Ambition**

It’s 2021, and I’ve been watching a brilliant grad student wrestle with a big question: Should she add coding to her neuroscience master’s? Honestly, it struck a chord. I remember feeling that pull – the desire to not just *understand* the brain, but to *build* tools to probe it.  Neuroscience is incredible, but the future feels inextricably linked to neuroengineering and computational methods.  It’s about recognizing that a truly deep dive might require a little algorithmic adjustment to your path.  Sometimes, the most rewarding journeys involve adding a new layer to the map.
