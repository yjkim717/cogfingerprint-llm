**Lost in Translation (and Customs Forms!)**

Remember last year when I bought a gorgeous hand-knitted scarf from a seller in Lithuania? It arrived beautifully, but then the return process hit a snag. Turns out, sending something *back* to the EU through customs triggered a whole host of unexpected fees.

Lesson learned: always research those customs rules! #ecommerce #returns #EU
