### The Oracle's Many Faces

The concept of a character guided by a mystical, answer-giving object like a Magic 8-Ball is a fantastic roleplaying hook. You could be a **Genie Warlock**, whose vessel is the very orb itself, your patron whispering fortunes from within. A **Divination Wizard** treats it as a focus, their own potent magic making the vague answers terrifyingly precise. The **Chronurgy Wizard** sees the ball not as a predictor, but a tool to nudge fate toward their preferred timeline. Finally, the **Stars Druid** might see the shifting liquid as a reflection of the cosmic truths written in the heavens, their power and the toy's answers one and the same. Each frame offers a unique path for a prophet of plastic and polyhedrons.

### Remembering the Click

It’s 2021, and my phone is a seamless extension of my mind. But I was cleaning out a drawer today and found my first digital camera from 2004. The clunky feel, the whirring lens, the tiny screen. I’d take three photos, then spend an hour transferring them to the computer via a chunky USB cable. We traded that deliberate process for instant, endless snaps. I miss the weight of it, the ceremony. Each click felt like it truly mattered.
