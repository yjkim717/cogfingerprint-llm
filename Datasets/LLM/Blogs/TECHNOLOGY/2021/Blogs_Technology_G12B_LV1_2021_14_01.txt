>## The Pixel Puzzle and the Quest for 7680x4320

It's funny the rabbit holes you fall down when tinkering with tech. Lately, I've been wrestling with display resolutions, specifically trying to figure out how they're represented internally – those seemingly random hex values. It started innocently enough, just wanting to understand the underlying math.

Then I hit a wall. My monitor supports a glorious 7680x4320 – practically a wall of pixels! But getting it to consistently register correctly across different applications felt like cracking a code. Why wasn't it 'just working'? 

Turns out, custom resolutions and their hex representations aren't always straightforward. It’s a reminder that even in this age of incredible technological advancement, there's still a layer of abstraction and sometimes, frustratingly, a bit of trial and error involved. Anyone else ever feel like they're battling the machine itself?
