**The Shiny Object Syndrome & My Notion App Obsession**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 was *weird*. The internet felt like a pressure cooker of hyped-up tech, and I got sucked in, big time. Specifically, I dove headfirst into Notion – everyone was raving about it as the ultimate productivity tool, and I needed to “optimize” my life, right? 

I was following every tutorial, joining every Discord server, and building this ridiculously complex system for… well, for organizing my notes. It felt like a race to build the *perfect* Notion workspace, fueled by the latest influencer’s recommendation. It mirrored that GME situation – everyone had a price target, a prediction, and a fervent belief, regardless of whether it actually made sense.

I realized I wasn't *using* Notion; I was chasing the idea of using it.  I spent hours tweaking, feeling stressed and comparing myself to others. It was exhausting! 

Looking back, it’s a good reminder.  Just because something is shiny and everyone else is doing it, doesn’t mean it’s right for *you*.  Sometimes, the best tool is simply… doing things.  Maybe my digital life needs a little less optimization and a lot more focus on, you know, actually living it.
