It’s 2021, and I’m scrolling through Reddit when a poll catches my eye: what if all the Mortal Kombat characters swapped genders? It’s more than a fun hypothetical—it’s a mirror reflecting how deeply we tie personality to gender in gaming. I think about Scorpion’s vengeance or Sonya’s resolve; would we perceive them differently if their genders were inverted? It’s fascinating how these digital identities shape our connections.

In a year where conversations around representation in tech and media are louder than ever, this simple poll reminds me that even in fantasy, our real-world perspectives on identity are at play. It’s a small but telling sign of how video games continue to challenge and evolve with us.
