## The Scroll & The Sigh: Finding Balance in a Digital World

Remember early 2020? We all dove headfirst into screens. By 2021, it felt like we *lived* online. I was guilty too – endless scrolling, chasing the next notification. But lately, I've been noticing a disconnect. A quiet hum of anxiety alongside the digital buzz. 

It's not tech itself, I think. It's the *constant*. The feeling of always needing to be "on." I'm trying to be more intentional now, putting my phone down, really *seeing* the world around me. Small steps, but it’s a start to reclaim a little quiet in the noise. Anyone else feeling this?
