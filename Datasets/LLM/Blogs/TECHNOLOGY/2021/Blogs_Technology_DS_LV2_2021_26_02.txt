It’s funny—I was cleaning out my closet today and found my old Corsair CX750M, box and all. Back in 2021, I’d just upgraded, thinking I’d need more power for some grand PC build that never happened. Now it’s just sitting there, a reminder of how our tech ambitions sometimes outpace reality. Anyone else have a "someday" project collecting dust? Maybe it’s time to let it go and pass it on.
