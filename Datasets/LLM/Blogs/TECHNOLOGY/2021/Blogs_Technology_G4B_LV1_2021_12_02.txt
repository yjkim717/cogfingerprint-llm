**The Scroll & The Shame**

Anyone else feel like 2021 was a *lot*? I was drowning in a sea of notifications, deadlines, and this weird feeling that I was constantly failing to keep up. It felt like every task – from replying to emails to finishing that side project – was a monumental, overwhelming mountain. 

I’d fall into this spiral of self-deprecation, telling myself I was lazy, incapable, and just generally behind. Then, inevitably, procrastination would kick in. It was exhausting. 

I started experimenting with a little “perspectivization,” trying to zoom out and see the bigger picture.  I even dusted off some Stoic exercises – focusing on what I *could* control, letting go of the rest.  It’s a work in progress, but learning to quiet the inner critic and prioritize felt like a tiny, vital shift.  Anyone else finding their way through the digital noise?
