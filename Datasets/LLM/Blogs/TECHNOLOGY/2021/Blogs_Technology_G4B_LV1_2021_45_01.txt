**Scala 3 and the Quiet Joy of Extension**

It’s weird how quickly a language can shift your perspective, isn’t it? Back in 2021, I was wrestling with Scala 2’s record classes – they were functional, sure, but felt…limited. Then I dove into Scala 3, and this ‘Self’ keyword just *clicked*. It’s like a little key unlocking a more elegant way to handle inheritance, especially when you need to merge functionality. 

I spent a frustrating afternoon trying to build a simple data class extender, and Scala 3’s syntax for it was just so much cleaner. It wasn’t flashy, but there was this quiet joy in seeing a complex concept handled so simply.  It reminded me that sometimes, the best tech is the one that feels intuitive.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps write a post focused on a slightly different angle (e.g., more technical detail)?
