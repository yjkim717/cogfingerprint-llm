>## The Ghosts in My Smart Home

It’s funny, isn’t it? We spend so much time chasing convenience. I finally caved and built a "smart home" last year – lights, thermostat, even a fridge that tells me I’m out of milk. And for a while, it *was* amazing.  

But lately, I've found myself feeling…disconnected.  I miss the simple ritual of flipping a light switch, the satisfying click. Now, it's a voice command, a notification on my phone.  There's a layer of abstraction between me and my own space. 

It’s not that the tech is bad, it’s just that it highlights a bigger question: are we losing something in our relentless pursuit of efficiency? Are we replacing tangible experiences with digital echoes? Maybe I'll go back to manually setting the thermostat, just for a little while.
