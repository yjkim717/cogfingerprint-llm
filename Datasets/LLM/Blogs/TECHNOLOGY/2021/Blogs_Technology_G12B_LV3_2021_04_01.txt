ow the unexpected costs can really sting. I recently tried swapping some Bitcoin for Cardano right within my Exodus Wallet – seemed convenient, right? Not so much. The exchange fees were *way* higher than I anticipated! It’s a good reminder to always double-check those costs before you hit 'confirm,' and maybe explore dedicated exchanges for better rates. Lesson learned! #crypto #ExodusWallet #tradingcosts
