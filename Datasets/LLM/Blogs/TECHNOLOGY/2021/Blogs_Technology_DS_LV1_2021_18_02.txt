It’s 2021, and I’m staring at a client’s aging MacBook, still humming along on Yosemite 10.10.5. The App Store stubbornly refuses to offer the jump to 10.11. It’s a stark reminder of how quickly technology moves on, leaving even reliable machines in the digital dust. There’s a certain melancholy in these moments—helping a loyal device cling to relevance, a small act of preservation in an era of relentless upgrades.
