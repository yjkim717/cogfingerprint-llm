>Okay, here's a reflective blog post draft inspired by your keywords and summary, but shifted to a technology theme and set in 2021. I've aimed for a conversational, relatable tone and a touch of reflective depth.  I've included a couple of options to give you some variety.  **Please read the notes at the end of both options, as they explain my thinking behind the choices.**

**Option 1: The Algorithm & Our Echo Chambers**

It’s 2021, and I’m realizing just how much my online world has become… curated. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but it’s definitely an echo chamber. The algorithms know me *too* well. I click on a tech review, and suddenly my feed is flooded with similar gadgets.  It's comfortable, familiar, but is it *real*? 

I started wondering, are we all choosing our own versions of “Old Leech” – the voices that reinforce what we already believe? And who are our modern-day Carols and Francos, the personalities we gravitate towards, even if… maybe they aren't quite right for us? It’s a bit unsettling, this selective exposure. Time to consciously shake things up, I think.

**Option 2: The Cult of the Shiny New Thing**

Remember when we were all obsessed with Clubhouse? It felt *huge* for a minute there. Now? Crickets.  That’s what's been on my mind lately – this relentless cycle of chasing the next big tech thing.  It’s almost… cult-like, isn’t it? We flock to influencers, to the loudest voices proclaiming the future. 

It reminds me of those communities that form around strong personalities.  Are we just looking for validation, for someone to tell us we’re on the right track? Maybe we need to step back and actually *think* about what technology truly serves us, not just what’s trending.

**Notes on Choices & Connection to Keywords:**

*   **Shifting the Theme:** I took the core concept of "following figures" and applied it to technology – specifically, influencers, trending platforms, and the allure of new tech.
*   **"Old Leech" Analogy:**  I interpreted "Old Leech" as representing a dominant, perhaps unquestioned, voice. This translates to the algorithmic feeds or influential figures shaping our tech perspectives.
*   **Carol & Franco:**  These were trickier. I treated them as representing personalities we might follow, perhaps without fully critical thought, drawn to them for reasons beyond pure logic.
*   **Jaws of Saturn:** This was the most abstract. I didn't directly reference it, but the overall tone aims for a sense of underlying unease or consequence, hinting at the potential downsides of blind technological adoption.
*   **2021 Context:**  Clubhouse was a very relevant example of a quickly rising and then fading platform in 2021, grounding the piece in that timeframe. The rise of influencer culture was also a significant trend.
*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "It's 2021, and...", "I started wondering...", and "Time to..." to create a more personal and relatable feel.
