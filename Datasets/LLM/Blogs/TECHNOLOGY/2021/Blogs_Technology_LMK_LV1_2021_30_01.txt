As I navigated my first professional setting in 2021, I realized a quality watch was a must-have accessory. I turned to the G-Shock GST-B100, a rugged yet stylish option. With a budget of $3,000, I'm seeking recommendations on the best watches for a polished look. How do others balance tech and style on their wrists? I'm eager to hear your thoughts on the perfect timepiece for a young professional.
