**The Weight of My Laptop (and a Really Good Bag)**

It feels like just yesterday I was frantically searching for the *perfect* bag – seriously, a *perfect* bag – before heading back to university in 2021. As a computer science student, my backpack was basically an extension of my laptop, hauling textbooks, chargers, and the occasional emergency chocolate bar. 

I needed something sturdy, something that could handle the daily Tokyo commute and the inevitable slide down a lecture hall aisle.  Turns out, a solid strap bag was the answer!  It’s a surprisingly simple solution, but it really did make a difference.  What’s your go-to tech accessory for staying organized?
