"Getting back to the action in CSGO was proving to be a real challenge. Every time I tabbed out to check my team's strategy or respond to a friend, I struggled to get back into fullscreen mode. The resolution was all over the place, and refocusing on the game was tough. After some trial and error, I finally found a fix - a simple tweak that got me back to gaming smoothly, no more tabbing woes!"
