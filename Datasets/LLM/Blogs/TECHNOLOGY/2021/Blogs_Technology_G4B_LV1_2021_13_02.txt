**The Shivers of the Unstake**

Remember 2021? Crypto was *everywhere*, and the promise of passive income through staking felt almost too good to be true. I was diving deep into IoTeX, excited about the unstaking process through IoPay. It seemed slick, efficient – a digital convenience. 

Then, a little glitch turned into a serious worry. A noticeable delay, followed by a creeping suspicion that my funds might be…somewhere else. It wasn’t a dramatic explosion, just a slow, unsettling feeling. 

It really got me thinking about the wild west of early crypto.  The allure of rapid returns can easily overshadow due diligence.  That experience, even a minor one, reminded me that even supposedly secure platforms can hold unexpected vulnerabilities.  A valuable lesson learned, and a healthy dose of caution added to my crypto toolkit.
