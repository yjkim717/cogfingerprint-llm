### The Invisible User

Re-reading Ralph Ellison’s *Invisible Man* in 2021 hit differently. It wasn't just about racial turmoil anymore; it felt like a user manual for our digital lives.

The narrator’s struggle to be seen in an absurd world mirrors my own feeling of shouting into the algorithmic void. We craft these intricate online identities—our profiles, our posts, our curated lives—desperate for connection and recognition. But the system, this vast, impersonal machine, often just sees data points. It’s a new kind of absurdity: building a digital "brotherhood" on platforms that profit from our division.

My identity isn't just my own anymore; it's a product shaped by engagement metrics and targeted ads. The promise of community often leads to echo chambers, and the quest for visibility can make you feel more invisible than ever. Ellison’s protagonist sought his true self outside the labels society forced on him. Maybe our fight is to remember there’s a person, not just a profile, behind the screen. The struggle for authentic identity has just found a new, bewildering battlefield.
