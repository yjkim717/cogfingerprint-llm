After two years of learning computer science through a screen, returning to campus felt like stepping into a new world. My old backpack, a trusty companion for online lectures, suddenly felt all wrong for navigating crowded hallways and bustling libraries. I needed something different—a sleek, should-strap bag that could hold my laptop without weighing me down.

My search for the perfect Tokyo totepack became a quest for a fresh start. It wasn't just about carrying my gear; it was about finding a companion for this new chapter of in-person collaboration and spontaneous coffee-shop coding sessions. The right bag, I realized, was the first step in physically embracing the campus life I’d only known digitally.
