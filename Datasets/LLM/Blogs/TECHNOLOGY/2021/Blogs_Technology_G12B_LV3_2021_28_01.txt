>## The Algorithm of Anxiety: When Your Grades Don’t Match the Code

Okay, let's be real. College application season is stressful enough without throwing a sudden GPA dip into the mix. That's where I'm at right now. I'm aiming for Computer Science – a field I *love*, spending hours lost in coding challenges and building little projects just for fun. My SAT scores were solid, and my extracurriculars show a genuine passion. But then… sophomore year hit differently. 

Life got a little chaotic, grades slipped, and suddenly I’m staring at a transcript that doesn’t quite reflect my potential. It feels like the system is working against me, an algorithm judging me on a single number. 

It’s easy to panic, to think it’s all over. But I’m trying to reframe it. Maybe this is a chance to show resilience, to demonstrate that I can learn from setbacks. Retaking the SAT is an option, of course, but I’m also focusing on how I can highlight my genuine interest in CS – those passion projects, those late nights debugging. 

Anyone else feeling the pressure? Let's navigate this together. #collegelife #computerscience #gpa #anxiety
