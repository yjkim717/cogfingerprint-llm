"I'm still frustrated about the CSGO glitch I encountered in 2021. Playing in fullscreen 4:3 stretched mode, I'd tab out to check the score or chat, but upon returning, the game would crash. I tried tweaking settings, but the issue persisted. It was a productivity killer, not just a gaming nuisance. I eventually switched to windowed mode, and the problem vanished. A simple workaround, but one that took trial and error to discover."
