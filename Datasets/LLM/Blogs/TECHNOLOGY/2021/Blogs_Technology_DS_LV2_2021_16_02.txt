It’s 2021, and I’m watching my nephew play a new fantasy RPG. He breezes through battles, but when I ask how armor class works, he shrugs. “I just hit buttons until it works.”

It reminded me of a recent D&D forum post—a player pleading for clearer tutorials on dice rolls and proficiency. It hit home: so much of tech today expects us to just “get it.” From cryptic error messages to features hidden behind three menus, we’re often left guessing.

We design intricate systems, yet forget the human on the other side—someone just wanting to play, create, or connect without friction. Maybe it’s time we focus not just on what tech can do, but how it welcomes everyone into the experience. After all, the best features are the ones people actually understand.
