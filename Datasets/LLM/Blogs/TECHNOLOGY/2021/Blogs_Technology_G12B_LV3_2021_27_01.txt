## Stuck in a Loop? Finding the Unexpected in Digital Spaces

Anyone else feeling a little… predictable lately? It’s 2021, we’re all online, and it's easy to fall into the same digital routines. I was feeling it hard in League of Legends, bouncing between the same URF builds, getting the same results. Then, I just threw caution to the wind and built a bruiser Rumble – Riftmaker and Demonic Embrace, the works. 

Suddenly, I was *surviving*. It was wild! It reminded me that sometimes, breaking from the established path, experimenting with the unconventional, can yield the most rewarding experiences, even in a game. Maybe we should all try that a little more – shake up our digital habits, explore the unexpected corners of the internet. You never know what you might find.
