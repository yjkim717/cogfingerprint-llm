## The Unexpected Resilience of Analog

Remember when everyone was obsessed with peak efficiency? Cloud storage, automated workflows, the relentless pursuit of optimization? 2021 felt like the pinnacle of that. Everything was about streamlining, minimizing friction. And honestly, it was exhausting.

Lately, I've been finding myself drawn back to… well, *things*. A physical notebook. A record player. Even a slightly clunky, old-school camera. It’s weird, right? Going backwards?

But there’s a surprising durability to it. A resilience. Like building a character in a game with a tanky build – Riftmaker and Demonic Embrace, if you will. Digital systems can crash, get hacked, disappear. But a handwritten note? A vinyl record? They endure. They *absorb* the hits.

Maybe it’s a reaction to the constant digital churn. Maybe it's just a craving for something tangible. Whatever it is, I'm finding a quiet strength in embracing the analog alongside the digital. It’s a surprisingly robust combination.
