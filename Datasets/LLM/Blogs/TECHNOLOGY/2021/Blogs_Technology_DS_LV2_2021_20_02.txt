I still remember the thrill of unboxing my first smartphone in 2021—that sleek promise of connection. Now, my pocket buzzes with endless notifications, yet I feel more distant than ever. We traded quiet moments for constant updates, mistaking digital chatter for genuine closeness. Sometimes I miss the days when a phone was just for calling, not curating a life. Technology promised to bring us together, but I wonder if it’s quietly building walls instead.
