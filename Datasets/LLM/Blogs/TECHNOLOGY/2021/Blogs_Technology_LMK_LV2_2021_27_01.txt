"Reviving URF Fun in League of Legends: My Bruiser Rumble Build". As I dove back into League of Legends in 2021, I found myself stuck in a rut, playing the same champions over and over. That's when I discovered the thrill of URF mode again. I decided to shake things up with a bruiser Rumble build. It was a game-changer! With this fun build, I was able to mix up my gameplay and experience the excitement of URF mode all over again. In this post, I'll share my build and how it brought back the joy of playing LoL.
