## The Silent SOS of Our Servers

It's funny, isn't it? We obsess over flashy new tech, but sometimes the real headaches lurk in the familiar. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with Windows Server 2016 DNS monitoring. Specifically, those Zone Query Overload alerts. They're a silent SOS, signaling a need for baseline tweaking. It's not glamorous work, setting up proper alert reporting, but it’s vital. Catching these subtle signs *before* a major outage? That’s the peace of mind that keeps me going in 2021.
