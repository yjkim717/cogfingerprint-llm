**VLC Quirks & Portrait Mode Blues**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with VLC again – you know how it is! I was trying to watch a YouTube video on my desktop last week, and it was stubbornly stuck in landscape. I missed the *perfect* fit to my screen. It’s bizarre, because the mobile version of VLC has this fantastic “fit to screen” option, including portrait.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps add a specific example or adjust the tone?
