>## The Unexpected Allure of Secondhand Tech & a Dash of Crypto

It's 2021, and the world feels…different. The pandemic shifted so much, including my own tech habits. I found myself staring at a pile of aging computers, victims of overheating and general wear and tear, feeling a pang of guilt. They were essentially useless. Then, an odd thought sparked: Monero mining.

Now, I'm not expecting to become a crypto millionaire. But the idea of repurposing these discarded machines, breathing new life into them, felt strangely appealing. I stumbled across a local seller offering Dell Latitude i5 laptops for just 50 euros each – a steal! 

It's a bit of a gamble, I know. Heat damage is a real concern, and mining itself generates a *lot* of heat. But the challenge is intriguing. It's a small project, a bit of tinkering, and a way to feel like I'm doing *something* constructive with tech that would otherwise just end up as e-waste. Plus, who doesn't love a little side hustle these days?



Hope this works for you!
