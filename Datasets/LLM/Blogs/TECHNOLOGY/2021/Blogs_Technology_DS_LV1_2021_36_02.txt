It’s late 2021, and I’m staring at my dedicated Monero mining rig, baffled. The hashrate keeps jumping around like a nervous rabbit—up, down, sideways—even though nobody’s touched the machine. I’ve checked the cooling, the power supply, everything. Then it hits me: could someone have remote access, quietly siphoning cycles when I’m not looking? It’s a strange feeling, realizing your own computer might not be entirely yours anymore. In our connected world, even a solo project can turn into a crowded room.
