**Title: Taming the VLAN Beast: Why I Ditched RouterOS (For Now)**

Okay, confession time. I love tinkering. Really *love* it. And for a while, that love affair involved my trusty MikroTik CRS354. It was a powerhouse, doing everything I needed... until I started piling on the VLANs. Seriously, it felt like every new project demanded another VLAN, and managing them all in RouterOS was becoming a genuine headache.

I'd spend ages just navigating the menus, double-checking configurations – the fear of a misconfigured network bringing everything down was *real*. It was a constant source of low-level stress. Then I stumbled across SwOS. 

The interface is just… cleaner. More intuitive. Suddenly, managing a dozen VLANs felt less like wrestling an octopus and more like organizing a spice rack. It’s not a wholesale replacement for RouterOS, mind you. Some of the advanced features are missing. But for my current needs, prioritizing ease of management, it’s been a game-changer. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best solution isn’t always the most feature-rich, but the one that lets you breathe a little easier.  Anyone else ever make a switch like this, just for sanity’s sake? Let me know in the comments!
