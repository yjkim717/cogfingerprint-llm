It’s funny how a piece of hardware can mark a chapter in your life. My trusty Corsair CX750M powered my headless server through late nights of coding and endless projects in 2021. It was the quiet, reliable heart of my little digital world. Now, as I pack it back into its original box—cables neatly coiled—I’m reminded that even in tech, we form attachments. It served me well, and for $75 on HardwareSwap, I hope it brings someone else the same steady performance.
