## Downloaded Bliss... or Just Bliss?

Okay, YouTube Premium has been a lifesaver for commutes, right? But I was wondering â€“ does picking 1080p for a download *really* mean better audio too? I dove in to test it, and it seems quality settings are separate! So, crisp visuals *and* clear sound, even offline. Small detail, huge impact on my listening experience. Anyone else obsessed with download quality?
