## The Quiet Panic of DNS Alerts (and Why Baselines Matter)

Remember that feeling when a monitoring alert screams at you at 3 AM? I do. Recently, I was wrestling with a DNS Zone Query Overload alert on our Windows Server 2016 infrastructure. It's a common one, right? But just seeing the *alert* isn’t enough. I needed to understand *how much* overload we were talking about to adjust our baselines properly. 

It’s a simple concept, really: knowing what “normal” looks like. Those specific alert values, captured and reported, are the key to a calm, proactive approach, not just reactive firefighting. Anyone else felt that quiet panic and the subsequent hunt for data?
