As I strolled along the Thames in the summer of 2021, I found myself pondering a dilemma. As an American software engineer on a tourist visa in the UK, I was enjoying the city's tech scene, and recruiters were reaching out with enticing job offers. But I hesitated - was simply responding to their messages a breach of the 'no work seeking' rule? I wasn't actively job hunting, but the conversations felt like a grey area. I wondered if I was inadvertently jeopardizing my visa status. As someone in the tech industry, I'm used to navigating complex systems, but UK immigration rules had me stumped. I started thinking - are others in a similar situation? What's the line between being open to opportunities and actively seeking work? As I continued my walk, I realized that my situation was a reflection of a broader issue - the blurred lines between work and leisure in the digital age.
