The eternal struggle of choosing the perfect laptop for development work! As a full-stack developer in 2021, I'm constantly on the lookout for a machine that can keep up with my demanding workflow. Recently, I've found myself torn between two top-notch options: the Lenovo X1 Extreme Gen 3 and the X1 Carbon Gen 9. 

The X1 Extreme Gen 3 boasts impressive specs, including a powerful processor and dedicated graphics card, making it a great choice for occasional gaming and resource-intensive tasks. On the other hand, the X1 Carbon Gen 9 is incredibly lightweight and boasts a stunning display, perfect for coding on-the-go. I'm also considering the possibility of using an eGPU to boost the X1 Carbon's performance. After weighing the pros and cons, I'm still undecided. Which one would you recommend for a developer like me? I'm eager to hear your thoughts and make an informed decision.
