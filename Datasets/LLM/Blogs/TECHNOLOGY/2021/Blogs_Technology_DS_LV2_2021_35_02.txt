Of course, here is a reflective blog post from the perspective of 2021.

### The Digital Invisible Man

Rereading Ellison’s *Invisible Man* this week hit differently. I kept thinking about our own modern absurdity: the algorithm.

We’re all building digital identities, crafting profiles for an unseen audience. We post, share, and comment, hoping to be seen. But the system—the great, indifferent algorithm—often feels like it’s looking right through us. It decides what’s relevant, what gets amplified, and what disappears into the void.

In 2021, my struggle isn't with physical invisibility, but with digital resonance. Am I just data points for a machine to categorize? The quest for authenticity gets lost in the noise of trends and optimized content. It’s a different kind of underground, but the core fight Ellison wrote about—to be recognized as a complex, individual self—feels eerily familiar. We’re all just trying to make the system see us.
