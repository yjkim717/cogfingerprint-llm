Remember that CyberPowerPC I was so excited about in 2021? Well, its roar could rival a jet engine! Turns out, those case fans were plugged into the CPU_OPT header and stuck on full DC power instead of the quiet PWM mode. It was a classic "new PC, first-world problem" moment. A simple cable shuffle later, and blissful silence returned. Sometimes, the loudest issues have the quietest solutions.
