It’s 2021, and I’m watching my team scatter like ants in a King of the Hill match. Everyone’s chasing kills, hungry for that "frag out" moment, while the objective circle sits empty. I’m stuck spectating, shaking my head. It’s a lot like our relationship with tech—distracted by flashy features while ignoring the core purpose. We’re so busy optimizing for speed or aesthetics that we forget what truly matters: connection and function. Sometimes, you just need to capture the circle.
