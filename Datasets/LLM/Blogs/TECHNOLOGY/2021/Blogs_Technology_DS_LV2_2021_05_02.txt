Looking back at 2021, I remember the strange intimacy of those endless video calls—the way we’d share quiet moments over pixelated screens, our lives boxed into Brady Bunch squares. It hit me one evening, watching my grandmother’s face flicker on my laptop as she told stories from her youth.

Here we were, separated by hundreds of miles, yet technology bridged the gap in a way letters or phone calls never could. It wasn’t just about convenience; it was about presence. In a year defined by distance, those digital windows didn’t just keep us connected—they kept us human. Funny how screens, so often blamed for isolation, became our lifelines to what mattered most.
