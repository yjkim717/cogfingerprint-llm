It’s 2021, and I’m the lone IT person for a small nonprofit. My work queue is a constant hum in the back of my mind. As a T1 analyst by trade, I was trained to triage, not to own every problem from start to finish. There’s a unique pressure when you’re the last line of defense. A server hiccup isn't just a ticket; it's a potential crisis with no one to escalate to. You become a jack-of-all-trades out of sheer necessity. Some days are empowering, but others feel like a tightrope walk without a net. It’s a role that teaches you more about your own limits than any manual ever could.
