It’s weird, isn’t it? I’ve been spending way too much time in *Echoes of the Void* lately, trying to master zone control.  I get so frustrated when my squad just… sits.  It’s like we’re playing solo, even when we’re grouped up.  I miss that feeling of coordinated pushes, of really *capturing* objectives with teammates.  Maybe I need to lower my expectations, or find a better group.  Anyone else feeling this disconnect in the meta?
