**The Unexpected Regex Rumble**

Okay, so 2021 was a weird year for my Java projects, right? We were pushing hard to migrate a key piece of code from Java 8 to 11 – a necessary evil, really – and I hit a wall I hadn’t anticipated. It wasn't a dramatic rewrite, but a tiny, stubborn regex. 

I spent a solid afternoon tracing it, convinced it was a fundamental VM change causing the difference. Seriously, I was going down the rabbit hole of JVM internals! Turns out, it was a subtle shift in how Java 11 handled whitespace – something I’d completely overlooked. 

It’s a good reminder that even with all the shiny new features and updates, the devil is often in the details. And sometimes, the biggest changes are the quietest ones.  Anyone else have a regex surprise recently?
