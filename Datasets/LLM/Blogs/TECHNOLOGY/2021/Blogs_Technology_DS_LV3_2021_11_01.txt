Looking back at 2021, I remember the nervous excitement of launching my Constantiam shop. It was more than a side project—it was a small dream realized through code and community. But life, as it often does, got busy, and my promised monthly updates fell behind.

So here’s a long-overdue but honest check-in. Sales have been better than I ever imagined—enough to not only sustain the shop but also to give back. I’ve donated a portion of the profits to support digital privacy advocacy, something I deeply believe in. And in the spirit of transparency, I have to share a small, human moment: I accidentally sent a bit extra in the last donation batch. Instead of stressing, I decided to let it ride as an unexpected contribution to the cause.

Sometimes, even our mistakes can turn into small acts of goodwill. Thanks for being part of this journey with me.
