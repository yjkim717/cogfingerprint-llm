**Digital Biology: Could Code Mimic Life?**

It’s weird, right? Back in 2021, I was completely fascinated by this idea of using computer simulations – essentially, cellular automata – to model how biological cells actually *work*.  Thinking about enzymes triggering chemical pathways, receptors responding to signals… it felt like we were on the cusp of creating digital organisms.  The potential to predict how diseases spread or even design new drugs felt incredibly exciting, and a little unsettling.  Do you think we'll ever truly build a living code?
