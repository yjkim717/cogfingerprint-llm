"When Automation Fails: A Frustrating Online Job Application Experience"

As I navigated through the CVS job application portal in 2021, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. The automated system asked me to upload my resume and cover letter, only to be met with a generic confirmation email. Weeks went by, and I received an email inviting me for an interview. However, the meeting turned out to be a waste of time, as the manager seemed uninterested in discussing the position. It became clear that my application had been a mere formality. The disconnect between the automated system and the human element was jarring. This experience made me reflect on the role of technology in our job search. While automation can streamline the initial application process, it can also lead to a lack of personal touch. As we increasingly rely on technology, it's essential to strike a balance between efficiency and genuine human interaction.
