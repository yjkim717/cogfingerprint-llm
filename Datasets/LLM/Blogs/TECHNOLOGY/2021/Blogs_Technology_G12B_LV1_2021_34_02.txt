>## The Scroll and the Stillness

It's 2021, and my phone feels like an extension of my hand. A constant stream of news, notifications, and perfectly curated lives. Lately, though, the endless scroll has been fueling a low-hum anxiety. So, I decided to try something radical: a 30-day digital declutter. 

It wasn’t about cold turkey, but conscious reduction. Less news, more books. Fewer social media rabbit holes, more walks. And surprisingly, a little bit of meditation. 

The first week was brutal. The urge to check was *real*. But slowly, the space between the pings grew. I felt… calmer. It’s a tiny shift, but a powerful one. Maybe finding stillness in a hyper-connected world isn't about escaping technology entirely, but about dedicated practice in choosing when to engage.
