"As I decluttered my tech stash in 2021, I came across my trusty Corsair CX750M 80+ Bronze PSU, barely used since powering my headless server. The original box and cables were still intact. I decided to pass it on to a fellow tech enthusiast via Hardwareswap. After a quick listing, it sold for $75. It's great to see my reliable PSU find a new home, and I'm excited to see what projects it'll power next!"
