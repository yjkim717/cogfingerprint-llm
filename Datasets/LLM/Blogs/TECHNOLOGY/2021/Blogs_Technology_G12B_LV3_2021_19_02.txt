## The Algorithm and Me: A Little Bit More Than I Can Handle?

It’s 2021, and we're all swimming in data, aren't we? Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit like a D&D Bard trying to manage their spells. You know, having access to *so many* potential spells but only a limited number of spell slots to actually use them. 

It struck me – how often do we feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information and options available to us online? Social media, streaming services, news feeds… it’s a constant barrage. We *know* about a million amazing things we *could* be doing, learning, or consuming, but realistically, we only have so much time and energy. 

Maybe it’s time to be a little more selective. Less "knowing everything," more *using* what truly resonates. What do you think?
