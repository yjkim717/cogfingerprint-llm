**Lost in the Algorithm, Found in the Streets**

It’s wild, right? I landed in the Bay Area last year, fresh off a coding bootcamp and full of Silicon Valley dreams. But honestly, the glossy startup world felt a million miles away from the reality of navigating San Francisco. As an immigrant, and a relatively new tech worker, I started noticing a creeping unease.

Recently, I was chatting with a friend about safety – specifically, walking home late after the BART.  It sparked a bigger conversation about feeling vulnerable, about the constant awareness you need to have.  I’m researching self-defense classes and even rethinking my reliance on public transport at night.  It’s a strange feeling, wanting to feel secure in a place that’s supposed to be innovative and exciting.
