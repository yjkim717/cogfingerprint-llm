It’s 2021, and I’m a software engineer visiting London on a tourist visa, sipping coffee in a cozy café. My phone buzzes—another message from a UK recruiter. My heart races.

You see, software engineering is on the UK’s shortage occupation list, and recruiters are eager. But last time, at border control, I got grilled just for mentioning my job. Now, I’m caught between opportunity and anxiety: does simply replying to these messages breach my visa terms?

It’s a strange limbo—being surrounded by the buzz of a city hungry for your skills, yet feeling like you’re tiptoeing on legal thin ice. Every ping feels like a potential misstep. How do you navigate the line between networking and compliance when your profession is in such high demand?
