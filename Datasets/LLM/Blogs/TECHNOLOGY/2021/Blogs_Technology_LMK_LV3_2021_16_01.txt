**The Meta Tag Conundrum: A NextJS Server-Side Rendering Saga**

As I dove into my latest project in 2021, I was excited to leverage the power of NextJS for server-side rendering (SSR). With its robust features and growing community, I knew it was the right tool for the job. However, I soon found myself entangled in a frustrating issue that tested my patience and forced me to dig deeper into the world of meta tags and dynamic rendering.

The problem was straightforward: I couldn't get NextJS to render meta tags server-side when using the Head component inside my class-based _app.js component. It seemed like a simple enough task, but no matter how hard I tried, those meta tags just wouldn't show up in the initial HTML response from the server. As a developer, I knew that this was not just a minor issue, but a crucial one - after all, meta tags play a significant role in search engine optimization (SEO) and social media sharing.

At first, I thought it was just a matter of misconfiguring the Head component or misunderstanding the documentation. But as I dug deeper, I realized that the issue was more nuanced. It seemed that the dynamic nature of my _app.js component was causing NextJS to hesitate when it came to rendering meta tags server-side. I was using a class-based component, and it appeared that this was not playing nicely with the Head component's expectations.

As I navigated this challenge, I couldn't help but reflect on the complexities of modern web development. With the ever-evolving landscape of frameworks and libraries, it's easy to get caught up in the excitement of new features and forget about the underlying intricacies. NextJS, with its SSR capabilities, promised to deliver fast and SEO-friendly pages, but it required a deep understanding of its inner workings.

In the end, I managed to resolve the issue by re-examining my component structure and finding a workaround that allowed NextJS to render the meta tags as expected. It was a valuable learning experience, one that reminded me of the importance of patience and persistence in the face of technical challenges.

As I look back on this experience, I'm reminded that the journey of a developer is often marked by moments of frustration and triumph. It's in these moments that we learn and grow, refining our craft and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. And so, I'll continue to explore the ever-changing landscape of web development, armed with a deeper understanding of NextJS and a renewed appreciation for the complexities of server-side rendering.
