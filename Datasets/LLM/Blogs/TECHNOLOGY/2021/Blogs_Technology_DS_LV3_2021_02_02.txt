The glow of my Samsung Note20 Ultra felt like an old friend, but the siren call of the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s camera was too strong to ignore. So, in late 2021, I took the plunge with T-Mobile, opting for their device payment plan to make the upgrade manageable.

That’s when the waiting game began. “Backordered.” The word became a frustrating mantra. My excitement curdled into daily checks of my order status, my old phone feeling more like a placeholder with each passing week. I was stuck in a weird limbo—too committed to the new device to back out, but unable to actually experience it.

It made me reflect on our relationship with technology. We chase the newest thing, believing it will unlock some new level of efficiency or joy. But here I was, confronted with the reality of supply chains and delays, a stark reminder that the digital world is still firmly anchored in a physical one. The promise of an upgrade is instant, but the process, as I was learning, often is not. All I could do was wait, my anticipation slowly being replaced by a more patient, pragmatic hope.
