**Building a Digital Fortress: My 21-Year Online Strategy**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re constantly bombarded with “get rich quick” schemes, but sometimes the most solid investments are the quiet ones. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about building a digital “portfolio” – not in the stock market sense, but of online assets. 

It started with a simple goal: consistent income through a few carefully chosen websites and courses.  Like that rental property plan, it’s a long-term play, a 21-year vision really. There’s a lot of noise in 2021 – algorithms, fleeting trends – but I’m focused on creating genuinely valuable things. 

I’m treating each website and course almost like a rental property, constantly nurturing them for consistent cash flow.  I know the digital landscape shifts, and there will be market fluctuations. But if I build a solid, reliable foundation, I believe it’ll weather any storm. It’s about consistent effort and a little bit of patience – a surprisingly familiar feeling, actually.
