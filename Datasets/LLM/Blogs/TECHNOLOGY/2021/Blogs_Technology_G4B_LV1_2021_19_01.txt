**The Static in My Head (and My Phone)**

Okay, 2021… it felt like everyone was just *plugged in*. Seriously, my phone was practically an extension of my hand. Scrolling, doom-scrolling, comparing… it was a constant hum of anxiety. I started noticing a strange disconnect, like my thoughts were getting lost in the endless stream of perfectly curated lives. 

It reminded me of that story I've been tinkering with – a villain warped by something deep inside, a darkness hard to understand.  I realized I was starting to feel a little like *that* character, trapped in a digital echo chamber. 

There was this weird pressure to be “on,” to respond instantly. It felt exhausting, almost… hostile to genuine feeling. I started setting boundaries, deleting apps, and forcing myself to just *look* at the trees outside.  It's a small thing, but stepping away from the static felt like a tiny act of rebellion, a little bit of reclaiming my own mind.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate something with a different focus?
