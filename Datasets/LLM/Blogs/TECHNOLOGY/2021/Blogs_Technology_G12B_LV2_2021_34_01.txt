## Remember When GPS Was a Luxury?

It’s funny, isn’t it? Just a decade ago, a GPS was a clunky, expensive gadget. Now, it’s practically woven into the fabric of our phones. I remember painstakingly plotting routes on paper maps, feeling ridiculously proud when I navigated somewhere new. 

Now, I can ask my phone to find the nearest coffee shop, and it’ll chirp back with directions. Sometimes, though, I miss that feeling of genuine discovery. That slight panic when you realize you’re *really* lost.  It felt… real. This seamless connectivity is amazing, sure, but I wonder if we're trading a little bit of adventure for pure efficiency. What do you think?
