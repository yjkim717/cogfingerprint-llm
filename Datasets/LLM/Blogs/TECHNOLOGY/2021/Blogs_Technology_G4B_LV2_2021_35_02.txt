**Lost in the Scroll: Finding Myself Again**

Okay, real talk. I’ve been spending *way* too much time scrolling lately. It’s 2021, and honestly, the internet feels like this constant, overwhelming tide. I recently finished revisiting Ralph Ellison’s *Invisible Man* – a decade-long project, actually – and it hit me in a way I hadn’t anticipated. 

Ellison’s narrator’s struggle to define himself, to be seen *as* himself, resonated so powerfully. It made me think about how easily we can get lost in the curated versions of ourselves we present online. Likes, followers, carefully chosen filters… are we building an “invisible man” of our own, hiding behind a digital facade? 

It’s a weird feeling, realizing how much of my identity is tied to how I’m perceived through a screen. I’m trying to push back, to reconnect with the quiet parts of myself, to just… *be*.  Anyone else feeling this pull?
