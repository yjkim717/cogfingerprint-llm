It’s 2021, and I’m deep in the DeFi rabbit hole, trying to stake my BNB without getting eaten alive by fees. I’ve been eyeing platforms like Beefy and Pantherswap, weighing the promise of a juicy APY against the reality of transaction costs. Is a slightly higher ROI worth it if fees chip away at my gains? It’s a constant balancing act in this fast-moving space—chasing yield while hoping my choices today don’t cost me tomorrow.
