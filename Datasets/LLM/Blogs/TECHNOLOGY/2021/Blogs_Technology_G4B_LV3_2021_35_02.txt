**The Algorithm Knows Me… But Does *I* Know Myself?**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Scrolling through social media in 2021, and feeling like an algorithm is building a profile of you – a hyper-specific, slightly unsettling portrait.  It’s feeding you ads for things you *might* want, suggesting friends you *might* connect with.  It’s all about optimization, right?  Making things easier, more efficient. 

Reading about Ellison’s *Invisible Man* again, it struck me how much the protagonist was grappling with a similar feeling – a manufactured identity imposed upon him by society.  We’re constantly curating our online selves, presenting the ‘best’ version to the world. But what happens when that curated self starts to feel… distant? 

I find myself wondering if this constant digital mirroring is actually eroding our individuality.  Are we becoming less aware of our own internal landscape, lost in the echo chambers of our feeds?  It’s a challenging question, and honestly, one I’m still trying to unpack.  Maybe the real resistance, in this age of constant connection, is simply learning to reconnect with *ourselves*.
