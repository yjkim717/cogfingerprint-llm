**Embracing Type Safety: A Scala 3 Journey to Simplify Data Mapping**

As developers, we've all been there - struggling to map complex Entity Models to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) without losing our minds. In 2021, with the rise of robust and scalable architectures, this task has become even more crucial. I've recently discovered a game-changer: using Scala 3 to elegantly handle this mapping, leaving Java libraries like MapStruct in the dust.

In the past, I relied on MapStruct to map my Entity Models to DTOs. While it got the job done, I often found myself fighting against its limitations. The lack of type safety and verbose configurations were just a few of the pain points. But with Scala 3, I've been able to harness the power of its robust type system to create a more maintainable and efficient data mapping process.

By leveraging Scala 3's advanced type features, I've been able to write more expressive and safe code. The result? A significant reduction in runtime errors and a more straightforward mapping process. My Entity Models and DTOs are now seamlessly connected, thanks to Scala 3's type-safe mapping capabilities.

This experience has taught me that sometimes, it's worth exploring alternative solutions to overcome the limitations of our current tech stack. By embracing Scala 3's type safety, I've not only simplified my data mapping but also gained a new appreciation for the importance of robust type systems in software development. If you're struggling with data mapping, I encourage you to give Scala 3 a try - you might just find your new favorite tool.
