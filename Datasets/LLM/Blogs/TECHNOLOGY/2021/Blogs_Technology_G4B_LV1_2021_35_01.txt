**The Algorithm's Allure**

It’s weird, isn't it? Scrolling through TikTok and feeling this pull towards accounts that *look* aggressive – like, really loud and confident. I found myself thinking about “Old Leechs” – people who seem deliberately designed to provoke a reaction. Carol, Franco… they had that intimidating potential. 

But then I realized it’s not about genuine threat. It’s about the dopamine hit of a strong opinion, the feeling of being acknowledged.  We crave attention, even if it’s delivered with a sharp edge.  It’s a strange reflection of how algorithms reward engagement, isn’t it?  Maybe we’re all just drawn to the loudest voices.
