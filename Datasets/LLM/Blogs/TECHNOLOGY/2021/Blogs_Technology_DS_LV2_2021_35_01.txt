Remember that first video call with my grandparents in 2021? We’d set up the tablet, their faces pixelated and voices lagging. But their wonder was crystal clear. They weren't just seeing us; they were visiting. In that moment, the tech faded away. It was just connection, bridging the lonely miles of that year. It reminded me that the real magic isn't the code or the bandwidth—it’s the human warmth we manage to transmit through it.
