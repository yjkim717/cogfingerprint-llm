"I recently upgraded my 2019 Cadillac Escalade Platinum and was reminded of the importance of proper trailering equipment. With a max tow capacity of 8,300 lbs, I wanted to ensure a safe towing experience. I invested in a reliable trailer brake controller and the right hitch setup. It's 2021 and technology has come a long way, yet towing still requires a mix of old-school know-how and modern tech. I'm confident in my rig's abilities, and I feel more connected to the driving experience, not less."
