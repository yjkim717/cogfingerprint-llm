## The Little Things That Annoy (and Delight)

Isn’t it funny how tech frustrations can be so… specific? I was wrestling with VLC the other day, trying to crop a video for a project. My phone does it effortlessly, beautifully even, adapting to portrait mode. But on my desktop? Nothing. Just a stubborn, widescreen view. It’s a tiny thing, but it highlighted how different our digital experiences can be across devices. Makes you wonder what other little conveniences are waiting to be bridged!



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
