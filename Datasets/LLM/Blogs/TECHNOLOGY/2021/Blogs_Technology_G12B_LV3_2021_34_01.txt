## That Escalade and the Fine Print… (and Tech, of Course!)

So, I was reading a forum post the other day – someone with a brand new Cadillac Escalade, understandably excited, but also a little bewildered. They wanted to know exactly what tech they *needed* to safely tow the maximum weight listed in the manual. It’s a good reminder, isn’t it? Even with all the amazing advancements, sometimes the most crucial information is buried in the details. It made me think about how we approach *all* tech – reading the fine print matters!
