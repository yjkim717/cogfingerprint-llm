**The Algorithm’s Whisper**

Remember 2021? The market felt…hungry. I was watching my portfolio, mostly index funds, when a weird little spike caught my eye – a handful of penny stocks I’d almost forgotten about were suddenly soaring. It felt like the algorithm was whispering, “Sell! Sell!” Panic set in.  It’s a bizarre feeling, seeing a tiny corner of your investment world react so dramatically.  I realized it wasn’t about predicting the future, but about acknowledging the inherent risk, and trusting my broader strategy.  A valuable lesson, even in a digital age.
