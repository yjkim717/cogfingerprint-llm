## The Unexpected Lesson My International Returns Taught Me About Tech & Trust

Running an ecommerce business in 2021 felt like a constant dance with logistics. One particularly frustrating hurdle? International returns. Those customs fees! They could eat into profit margins faster than you could say "shipping label." 

I was wrestling with this, feeling defeated, when a customer suggested something surprisingly simple: re-marking the package as a 'return' on the customs form, backed by a copy of the original invoice. It worked! A little grey area, perhaps, but it felt like a necessary workaround in a system that often felt opaque. 

It got me thinking – we’re constantly trusting technology, algorithms, and automated systems. But sometimes, a bit of human ingenuity, a little creative problem-solving, and a willingness to think outside the box (or shipping container!) is what truly gets things moving.
