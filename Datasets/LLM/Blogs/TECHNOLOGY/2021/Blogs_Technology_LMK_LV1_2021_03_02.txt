As I dove into the world of Mortal Kombat in 2021, I stumbled upon a fascinating Reddit thread that flipped the script on the classic fighting game. The user reimagined iconic characters with inverted sexuality, swapping male and female traits. It got me thinking - what if our digital avatars could challenge traditional norms? This thought experiment highlights the power of tech to subvert expectations and spark new ideas, leaving me wondering what other gaming surprises the future holds.
