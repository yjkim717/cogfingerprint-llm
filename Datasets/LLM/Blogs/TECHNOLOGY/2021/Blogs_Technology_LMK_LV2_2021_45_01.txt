"Embracing the Future of Scala: A Journey with Scala 3"

As I dove into the world of Scala 3 in 2021, I was thrilled to explore its new features. One of the most exciting aspects was the enhancement of type systems, particularly the "Self" type. I found myself pondering how to leverage this feature to create more robust and maintainable code. My curiosity led me to experiment with implementing a `join` method that could elegantly merge two objects. By utilizing the `Self` type, I was able to ensure that the return type was the same as the type of the objects being joined. Paired with other Scala 3 innovations like `record class` and improved `type parameter` handling, the new `selectable` feature allowed for more expressive and safe coding practices. This journey not only deepened my understanding of Scala 3 but also opened up new possibilities for more efficient and readable code.
