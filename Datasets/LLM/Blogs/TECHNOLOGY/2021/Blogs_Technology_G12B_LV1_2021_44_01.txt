## The Algorithm and My Small Portfolio

It’s funny, isn't it? Just a couple of years ago, the idea of casually trading stocks from my phone felt like something out of a sci-fi movie. Now, platforms like Trading 212 make it incredibly accessible. I’ve been dipping my toes in with a small portfolio – roughly £3,000 – for about eight months now. Lately, I've been wrestling with the 'invest' versus 'ISA' question. It's a bit overwhelming! It feels like the technology has outpaced the understanding. Still learning, still tweaking, and hoping to navigate this digital financial landscape wisely.
