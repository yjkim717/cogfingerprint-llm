Back in 2021, I found myself staring at lines of code for a cellular automaton project, feeling stuck. I realized my simulation was missing the beautiful chaos of real biology. I needed a dataset—not just any data, but one that could map out enzyme handshakes, receptor signals, and the intricate dance of chemical pathways. It hit me then: technology isn’t just about building systems; it’s about capturing life’s subtle rhythms. By weaving biological nuance into digital models, we don’t just simulate—we connect more deeply to the world we’re trying to understand. It’s where science meets soul.
