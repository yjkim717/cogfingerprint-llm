## The Algorithm Knows, But Does It *See*?

It's 2021, and I'm staring at a screen, as usual. Feels a little absurd, doesn't it? We've built these incredible tools – these digital extensions of ourselves – and yet, I can't shake this feeling of… invisibility. 

I was re-reading Ralph Ellison’s *Invisible Man* recently, and it hit me hard. The protagonist's struggle to be seen, to be recognized as a whole person, echoes in this hyper-connected world. We curate our online personas, meticulously crafting images and narratives, but are we *really* being seen? Or just categorized by algorithms?

The Brotherhood in Ellison's novel promised liberation, but ultimately boxed the protagonist into pre-defined roles. It makes me wonder if our social media feeds aren't doing something similar. We're fed what the algorithm *thinks* we want, reinforcing existing biases, subtly shaping our views. 

Maybe it's time to "tune out" a little, to actively seek out perspectives that challenge the echo chamber. To remember that behind every profile picture, there’s a complex, messy, *visible* human being.
