Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on your summary and the 2021 context, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone:

**The Blue Light and the Ghosts**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we’ve built these little digital worlds, these glowing screens that promise connection, yet sometimes feel like they’re amplifying the quietest corners of our minds. 2021 felt… intense. Everyone was glued to their phones, scrolling, comparing, reacting. And I started noticing a strange parallel to the kind of dark stories I love to write. 

I was wrestling with a villain – a character consumed by his own demons, a man haunted by the past. Suddenly, my late-night screen time felt… relevant. The endless scroll, the feeling of being overwhelmed, it mirrored that internal struggle. 

It made me think about the "dark theme" aesthetic everyone was embracing – the muted colours, the sense of isolation. Maybe it’s a subconscious craving for solace, for a space to acknowledge the shadows.  Exploring those difficult emotions, both in my writing and in my own life, felt like a step towards actually *healing*, a little bit of light breaking through the blue glow.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focus on a specific aspect or adjust the length?
