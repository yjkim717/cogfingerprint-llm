## The Algorithm and the Echo Chamber

It’s 2021, and I'm still wrestling with this feeling – this low-level unease about how we consume information online. Lately, I've been noticing how easily we gravitate towards voices that *confirm* what we already believe. It’s like… why seek out the challenging perspective?

I saw a thread the other day about a wellness guru – let’s call her “Barron” – and the fervent loyalty her followers displayed. It felt… odd. It reminded me of conversations I’d had years ago about cults, about how people latch onto charismatic figures and dismiss anything contradictory. 

And then I thought about the algorithms. They *feed* us this echo chamber. They prioritize engagement, not truth. We’re rewarded for clicking, for agreeing, for staying within our pre-defined bubbles.  Are we consciously choosing these voices, or are we being subtly guided? It’s a question that keeps circling in my head. Maybe we all need a digital "Leech" to shake us up a bit.
