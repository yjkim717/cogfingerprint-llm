## Lost in the Algorithm, Finding Myself on the Road

Remember when road trips felt… simpler? Before Google Maps dictated every turn, before Instagram demanded every scenic vista be documented? I do. And lately, I've been craving that feeling again. 

My friend’s planning a massive cross-Canada journey, starting in New Brunswick, and hitting Ontario. He's already got the big stops covered – Cochrane, Sudbury, Thunder Bay – but he wants to find those hidden gems, those smaller cities offering a real sense of place. It got me thinking about how technology, while undeniably helpful, can sometimes strip away the serendipity of travel. 

We rely so heavily on algorithms to curate our experiences, but what about the joy of stumbling upon a quirky bookstore, or a local diner with the best pie you've ever tasted? Maybe the best adventures aren't the ones planned, but the ones discovered – unplugged and unexpected. Maybe it’s time to ditch the hyper-optimization and embrace a little delightful disorientation.
