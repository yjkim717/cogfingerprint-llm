As a tech worker new to the SF Bay Area in 2021, I was curious about the safety of navigating this vibrant region. From walking alone at night to using public transport, I wondered if I needed to be extra cautious. I asked around and discovered that while the Bay Area is generally considered safe, it's always wise to be aware of your surroundings. For instance, when using BART or buses, it's a good idea to sit near the driver or in a well-lit area. I also learned some basic self-defence techniques, which gave me a sense of confidence and preparedness. As someone who spends most of their day coding, it's easy to get caught up in the tech bubble, but it's refreshing to take a step back and appreciate the world outside. By being mindful of my surroundings, I can enjoy all that the Bay Area has to offer while staying safe.
