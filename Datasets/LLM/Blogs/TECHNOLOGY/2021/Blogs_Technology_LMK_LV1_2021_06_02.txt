"My Recent Tech Job Interview Disaster: A Waste of Time?

I recently had a job interview at a local technical school's career fair, and it was a total letdown. The interviewer seemed completely uninterested, and I left feeling frustrated. This experience reminded me of my previous job interview at CVS back in 2021. The manager there was equally unimpressed, and I sensed that they were just going through the motions. It's like they were checking a box, not actually considering me for the role. This got me thinking - is this a symptom of the antiwork movement, where people are reevaluating their priorities? Or is it just a case of inefficient hiring practices? Whatever the reason, it's clear that wasting people's time is not an effective way to build trust or attract top talent. As someone who's passionate about technology, I'm eager to see more innovative approaches to hiring and recruitment."
