It’s 2021, and I’ve been thinking a lot about invisibility—not in the sci-fi sense, but in the digital one. Every day, algorithms quietly shape what we see, hear, and believe. It’s a strange kind of racial and social turmoil, playing out in unseen codes and curated feeds.

I remember reading Ellison’s *Invisible Man* years ago, and it hits differently now. In a world saturated with information, carving out an identity feels like swimming against an invisible current. We’re nudged into boxes—consumer profiles, political leanings, echo chambers—until individuality starts to feel like a radical act.

Sometimes, this digital landscape feels absurd, almost surreal. But that’s why it’s so vital to pause, to question, to remember there’s a person behind every screen. Staying true to ourselves isn’t just nostalgic; it’s necessary. Because in a system designed to render us invisible, choosing to be seen is everything.
