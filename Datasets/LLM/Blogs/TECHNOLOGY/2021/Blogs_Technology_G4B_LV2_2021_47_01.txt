**The Orange Glow of Frustration**

Anyone else ever feel like their tech just *actively* hates you? I hit a wall with my Lexmark E260dn last week, and it wasn’t pretty. Suddenly, a flashing orange LED was my new best friend – a constant reminder of a printer error I couldn’t quite crack. 

It started with a toner leak, a little dark stain spreading across the paper tray, and then a frustratingly limited firmware update option. I spent a solid afternoon wading through online forums, feeling increasingly defeated. There’s something about a machine you rely on suddenly malfunctioning that really throws you. 

Honestly, it’s a surprisingly emotional experience! We build these connections with our devices, expecting them to just *work*. It’s a good reminder that even in 2021, technology can be temperamental and that sometimes, the best solution is just a patient reset and a deep breath.  Anyone else had a similar tech tantrum lately?
