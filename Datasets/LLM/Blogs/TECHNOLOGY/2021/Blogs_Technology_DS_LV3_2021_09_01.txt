It’s 2021, and like so many of us, I’m still spending most of my days glued to a screen. In a bid to create the perfect home office, I invested in the much-hyped Markus chair, hoping it would be my ergonomic savior.

The first few hours were fine. But as the weeks wore on, my lower back started whispering complaints that soon turned into shouts. The lumbar support sits just a little too low, failing to cradle the curve of my spine during those long coding sessions. And the armrests—stubbornly fixed in place—forced my shoulders into an awkward, perpetual shrug.

I’ve learned that technology isn't just about the software that powers our world; it's about the physical interface, the chair that supports the person writing the code. A poorly designed tool, no matter how stylish, can become a source of pain. My search for true comfort continues, a quiet reminder that in our digital age, the most important upgrades are sometimes the ones that support our very human bodies.
