**The Unlikely Solace of Code: Navigating Loneliness as a Woman with Asperger's in Tech**

As I sit here in my small apartment, surrounded by the familiar glow of screens and the hum of machinery, I am reminded of the peculiar comfort that technology has brought to my life. It's 2021, and the world outside is buzzing with the news of a pandemic that has left many feeling isolated and alone. But for me, a 40-year-old woman with Asperger's syndrome, the feelings of loneliness and disconnection are not new.

After moving back to the US, I found myself struggling to adjust to a new environment, away from the familiarity of my old life. The anxiety of navigating social situations, the pressure to conform to unwritten social norms, and the exhaustion of masking my true self had taken a toll on my mental health. As someone with Asperger's, I've always found solace in the world of software engineering – a realm where rules are clear, and interactions are often reduced to straightforward communication.

As I immersed myself in coding, I discovered a sense of purpose and belonging. The logic and structure of programming languages became my sanctuary, a place where I could escape the complexities of human relationships. The online communities of developers and engineers became my support network, a group of like-minded individuals who understood my passion and my struggles.

But as much as technology has been a source of comfort, it's also highlighted the paradox of my existence. On one hand, I'm grateful for the connectivity that the digital world offers – the ability to collaborate with others across the globe, to share knowledge, and to learn from their experiences. On the other hand, I'm aware of the irony that, despite being surrounded by people online, I still feel a deep sense of loneliness.

As I reflect on my journey, I realize that it's not technology that's the problem, but rather the societal expectations that surround it. We're often led to believe that tech is a male-dominated field, that those with autism or Asperger's are somehow less capable of forming meaningful connections. But my experience tells a different story. For me, code has been a bridge, not a barrier – a way to connect with others who share my passions, and to find solace in a world that often feels overwhelming.

As I continue to navigate the complexities of my mental health, I'm reminded that technology is not a replacement for human connection, but rather a tool that can facilitate it. And for those of us who feel like we don't quite fit the mold, it's a reminder that there's a community out there waiting to be found – a community that understands, accepts, and supports us for who we are.
