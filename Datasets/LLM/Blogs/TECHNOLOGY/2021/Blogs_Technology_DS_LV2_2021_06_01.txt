### The Glitch is Part of the Show

It’s 2021, and my nightly ritual involves watching Kitboga turn the tables on scammers. There’s a unique magic in his Twitch streams—the absurd characters, the drawn-out ruses, the collective cheer when a scammer’s script falls apart.

But here’s the thing I’ve come to love, even when it’s frustrating: the technical hiccups.

The screen share that freezes. The audio that cuts out right at the climax. The frantic tab-switching as a timer counts down. As a fellow creator, my first instinct was to groan. *“Be more prepared!”* I’d think, my own perfectionism flaring up.

Then I had my own live-streaming disaster—a green screen failure that turned me into a floating head. The chat didn’t roast me; they rallied. We laughed together, and the moment became a shared inside joke.

Watching Kitboga’s unpolished moments now, I see them differently. They’re not failures; they’re proof. It’s a live, unscripted battle against chaos, and we’re all in it together. The stutters and glitches are a reminder that behind the entertaining facade is a real person, just trying to make things work. And honestly, isn’t that the most relatable part of all?
