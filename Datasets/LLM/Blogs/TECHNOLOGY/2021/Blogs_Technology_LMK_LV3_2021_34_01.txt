Towing with my 2019 Cadillac Escalade Platinum has been a game-changer. As I prepared to hit the open road, I realized that reaching the vehicle's maximum trailer weight of 8,300 lbs required more than just a hitch. I invested in essential trailering equipment, including a reliable trailer brake controller. Understanding my Escalade's towing capacity was crucial to safe towing. With the right gear and a bit of know-how, I've been able to tow with confidence, exploring new destinations with ease. It's been a liberating experience, and I'm hooked on the adventure.
