There’s nothing quite like that sinking feeling when your Horizon View environment starts throwing provisioning errors right in the middle of the day. I remember staring at the alerts in early 2021, convinced it was a simple capacity issue. Our VSAN was supposed to be this resilient, self-healing marvel, but here we were, dead in the water.

Digging deeper, I found the culprit wasn't a lack of raw storage, but something more insidious: the VSAN component limit. We’d hit a wall not because the datastore was full, but because of the sheer number of components—the fundamental building blocks VSAN uses to manage data. The real kicker? Orphaned VMDK files from old, deleted linked-clone desktops were still hanging around, silently consuming these precious component slots. They were digital ghosts, haunting our cluster and preventing new VMs from being born.

It was a humbling lesson in proactive capacity management. We’d been so focused on the big, obvious metrics—overall storage space, CPU, and memory—that we’d overlooked this quieter, more technical limit. The fix was a scheduled cleanup script, a simple piece of automation to sweep away those forgotten files. But the real change was a shift in mindset. It taught me that stability isn’t just about responding to crises; it’s about understanding the hidden mechanics of your systems and tending to them, routinely and respectfully. Sometimes, the smallest, unseen things can bring everything to a halt.
