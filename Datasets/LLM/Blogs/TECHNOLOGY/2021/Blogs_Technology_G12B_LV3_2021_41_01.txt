## Rebirth Island Blues: Anyone Else Getting Kicked?

Seriously, is it just me? I'm loving *Warzone*, especially the smaller, faster gameplay of Rebirth Island. But lately, I’ve been getting booted from matches *constantly* when I'm on that map. Verdansk is smooth sailing, but Rebirth? Disconnects, lag spikes, the whole frustrating shebang. Anyone else dealing with this host issue? Hoping it's a server thing they can fix soon – losing a clutch fight because of a dropped connection is the worst!
