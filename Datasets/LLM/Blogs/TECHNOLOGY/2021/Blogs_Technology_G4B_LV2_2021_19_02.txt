**The Endless Scroll & the Feeling of Not Knowing**

Remember that feeling in 2021? Like you were perpetually chasing something just out of reach? For me, it was a deep frustration with how everything – *everything* – was supposed to work. I was diving into a new online course, trying to learn how to build simple websites, and I was *lost*. 

It was like wading through an endless scroll of tutorials, each promising the answer to my question, only to lead me down another rabbit hole. Just like that D&D player wrestling with Bard spell slots – the desire for *more*, for a deeper understanding, but feeling bogged down by the mechanics. 

I realized I was so focused on *knowing* the “right” way to do things, I wasn't allowing myself to just… explore.  The internet promised instant mastery, but it often just amplified the feeling of not quite getting it.  It’s a weird paradox, isn't it?  We’re more connected than ever, yet sometimes, the biggest challenge is simply admitting we don’t have all the answers.

Would you like me to adjust the tone, length, or focus of this draft in any way?
