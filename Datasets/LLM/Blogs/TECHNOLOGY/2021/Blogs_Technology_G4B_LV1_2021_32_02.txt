**The Year My OptiPlex Started Fighting Back**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 was a weird year for tech. I finally bit the bullet and upgraded my home office with a Dell OptiPlex 7080. It seemed like a solid investment, a reliable workhorse. But about six months in, things started to… glitch. 

It wasn’t a dramatic, “the computer exploded” kind of thing, but a frustrating series of little problems. The webcam would randomly freeze, the audio would cut out mid-Zoom call – seriously annoying. Then, I started reading Reddit threads, and it felt like I wasn't alone. A lot of people were reporting similar issues with the 7080s, hinting at possible motherboard problems or even issues with the power supply. 

I even tried a USB hub, hoping to isolate the issue, but nothing seemed to stick. It’s a reminder that even the most carefully chosen tech can have its moments of rebellion. It just goes to show, you can never fully predict how a machine will behave!
