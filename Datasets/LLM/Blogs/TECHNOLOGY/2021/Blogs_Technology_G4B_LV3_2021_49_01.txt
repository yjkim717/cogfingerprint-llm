Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the summary and keywords, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone, around 188 words, and set in 2021:

**The Imposter Syndrome of a Shiny New Degree**

It’s weird, isn’t it? You finally graduate with a computer science degree in 2021, feeling like you’ve *finally* done it. But then… the job search hits. Suddenly, all those late nights coding, the frantic Stack Overflow searches, feel… inadequate. I remember feeling exactly like that recent grad in the summary – completely overwhelmed, staring at a wall of rejection emails, and wondering if I’d even built anything worthwhile.

I’d had zero internships, a common struggle for many of us. The thought of another generic application just felt soul-crushing. That’s when the idea of a coding bootcamp started to bubble up. It felt like a shortcut, a way to condense years of learning into a focused burst. A way to lessen the pain of the job hunt. 

Was it the right answer? Honestly, it’s still a work in progress. But it forced me to confront my imposter syndrome and really hone my skills.  It’s a tough path, this tech career, but recognizing that feeling of being lost is the first step to finding your footing.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect (like the bootcamp decision or the feeling of rejection)?
