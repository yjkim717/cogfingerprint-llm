**Lost in the Maple Leaves: Finding Stillness on a Digital Road Trip**

2021 felt like a year of frantic scrolling – a constant need to *do* and *see* through a screen. But this summer, I craved something different. I plotted a cross-Canada road trip, deliberately avoiding the big cities and aiming for those hidden gems in Ontario. 

It was a beautiful reset.  Honestly, pulling over to a quiet town square, far from GPS signals, felt revolutionary.  I realized how much I’d been missing by relying solely on algorithms to dictate my journey.  Sometimes, the best discoveries—the most peaceful moments—happen when you simply *let* yourself get a little lost, both on the road and in your own thoughts.
