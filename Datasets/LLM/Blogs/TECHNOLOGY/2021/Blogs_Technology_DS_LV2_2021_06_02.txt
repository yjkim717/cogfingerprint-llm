Remember that frantic, end-of-2021 scramble to upgrade our home tech? I was convinced my old router was the villain throttling my life. After hours of research, I bought a top-tier Wi-Fi 6 model, promising blistering speeds.

The setup was a breeze. The sleek new unit blinked with reassuring, modern lights. I ran a speed test, heart pounding with anticipation. The result? Identical to my old one.

Turns out, my internet plan was the bottleneck all along. Iâ€™d spent all that energy and money polishing the doorknob when the real issue was the hallway. It was a classic case of misdiagnosis, a high-tech version of putting lipstick on a pig.

It was a humbling lesson in looking at the whole system, not just the shiniest component. Sometimes, the flashiest "upgrade" is just a waste of time and money if the core foundation can't support it. Ever had a tech "solution" that missed the real problem entirely?
