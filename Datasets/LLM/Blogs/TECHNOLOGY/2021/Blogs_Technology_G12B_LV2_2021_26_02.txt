 Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your input, aiming for that reflective, conversational tone and 2021 context:

## The Ghosts in My Server Room (and a Surprisingly Good Deal)

You know that feeling when tech gets…*past* its prime? I’ve been wrestling with it lately. My little headless server, built years ago for some half-baked home automation project, has been quietly humming away, mostly unused. It was time to declutter.

Turns out, even “old” tech has value. I just listed a Corsair CX750M power supply from it – barely touched, all cables included – for $75. Feels good to give something a second life, and honestly, a little nostalgic. It’s a reminder of all the tinkering, the ambition, the projects that didn’t quite pan out. Anyone need a solid PSU? 😉



Hopefully, that captures the vibe you were going for! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
