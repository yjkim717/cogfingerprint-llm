**The Imposter Syndrome & The Bootcamp Gamble**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 felt… intense. The tech world was booming, everyone was talking about remote work and ‘digital nomad’ lifestyles, and I was sitting here, a fresh Computer Science grad with a shiny degree and absolutely zero internships under my belt. It was terrifying. The job search felt less like a hunt and more like a desperate, frantic scramble.

I kept seeing these incredibly polished profiles – people with years of experience, multiple projects, and those coveted internships. Meanwhile, I was staring at my resume, feeling like a complete imposter.  I started seriously considering a drastic change: an intensive App Academy bootcamp. 

It felt like a huge gamble, a way to compress six months (or more!) of learning into a few months and, hopefully, dramatically shorten that agonizing job search.  My friends were supportive, but there was a healthy dose of “are you *sure*?” echoing around. 

Honestly, there’s still a little of that imposter syndrome lurking, but the idea of a structured environment, dedicated mentorship, and a cohort of equally-stressed-but-determined people felt like the best shot I had.  It’s a leap of faith, definitely. But sometimes, you just need to jump.  Anyone else considering a similar pivot in 2021? Let's talk!
