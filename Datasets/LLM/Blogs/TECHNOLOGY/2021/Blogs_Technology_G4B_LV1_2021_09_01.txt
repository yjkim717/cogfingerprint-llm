**My Desk, My Dilemma (and a Seriously Awkward Chair)**

Okay, so 2021 was *the* year of working from home, right? I finally upgraded my desk – beautiful walnut, the whole nine yards – but I completely overlooked the chair. I grabbed something “ergonomic” online, and honestly, it’s been a disaster. 

The armrests are adjustable, which is nice, but the lumbar support? Let’s just say it’s… minimal. I find myself constantly shifting forward, and my back is screaming. It’s a classic case of prioritizing aesthetics over actual comfort. 

I've been trying to compensate with a rolled-up towel, which is both embarrassing and not ideal.  I'm seriously considering a proper ergonomic chair – maybe even a splurge – because my posture (and my sanity) deserve better.  Anyone else relate? #WFHproblems #ergonomics #chairlife
