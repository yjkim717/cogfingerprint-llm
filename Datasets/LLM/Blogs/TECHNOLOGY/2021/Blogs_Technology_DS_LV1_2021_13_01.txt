### The Digital Paper Trail

Remember when “going paperless” was the ultimate modern goal? In 2021, I find myself laughing at the irony. My life is more digital than ever, yet I’m drowning in a sea of physical documents, all because of a baffling request from my local prefecture.

I’ve been an expat teacher in France for years. My *titre de séjour*—my work visa—needs renewal, a familiar dance. But this time, the rules have shifted. The required documents list now includes the birth certificates of my parents. Both of whom have been deceased for over a decade.

It’s a surreal bureaucratic hurdle. I’m applying as a *travailleur temporaire*, not for permanent residency, which has more stringent family history checks. Why does the French state need proof of the existence of two people who have never set foot in this country to confirm I can continue teaching English grammar? My own birth certificate, passport, work contracts, and tax filings apparently aren’t enough. The logic is a black box.

So here I am, a supposedly digital citizen, scrambling to get certified, translated copies of 70-year-old documents from another continent. I’ve spent more time on international phone calls and waiting for postal services than I have lesson planning. It feels like a step back in time, a reminder that for all our cloud storage and digital signatures, the most important parts of our identity are still often judged by fragile, yellowing pieces of paper. It makes you wonder what, or who, the system is really trying to prove.
