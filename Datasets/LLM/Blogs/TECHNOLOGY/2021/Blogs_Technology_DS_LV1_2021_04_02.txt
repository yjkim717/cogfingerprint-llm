### My Digital Wake-Up Call in the YouTube Comments

I’ll be honest, I thought my corner of the internet was pretty sane. My Twitter feed is a curated list of memes and news, and my Instagram is all travel dreams and aesthetic coffee art. I felt informed. Then, out of boredom one afternoon in 2021, I fell down a rabbit hole I didn't expect: the comments section of a news report about the COVID-19 vaccine.

It was a parallel universe.

Scrolling through, I saw not just hesitation, but full-blown conviction in theories that felt like they were from a dystopian novel. Comments about government microchips, how the vaccine was a tool for total control, and that the whole pandemic was an elaborate hoax. These weren't just one-off trolls; there were hundreds of them, all agreeing, amplifying each other's fears.

It was my first real, visceral encounter with the antivaxxer echo chamber, and it shook me. It wasn't just that they believed this, but *how* they believed it. On YouTube, the algorithm creates these perfect, self-contained worlds. You watch one skeptical video, and suddenly your entire recommended feed is a cascade of content that confirms that single doubt. It’s a feedback loop of fear.

It made me realize my own bubble was just as artificial, just more aligned with my worldview. Technology was supposed to connect us, but in 2021, it feels like it’s building invisible walls. We’re not just on different pages; we’re in entirely different books, convinced ours is the only one that makes sense. It’s a sobering thought for anyone who grew up, like I did, believing the internet was a place for open minds.
