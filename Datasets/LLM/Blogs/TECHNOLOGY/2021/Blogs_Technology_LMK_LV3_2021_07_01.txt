"Navigating the complexities of cross-border ecommerce can be daunting, especially when it comes to returns. I recall a particularly tricky experience in 2021 with a return from outside the EU. By streamlining my return policy and leveraging technology to pre-clear customs, I avoided additional fees on subsequent returns. This not only saved me costs but also enhanced customer trust, proving that with the right strategies, international shipping and ecommerce returns can be managed efficiently."
