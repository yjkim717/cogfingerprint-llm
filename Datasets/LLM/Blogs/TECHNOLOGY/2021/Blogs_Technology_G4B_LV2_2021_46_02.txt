**Azure Files & Group Policy: A Surprisingly Sticky Situation**

Remember 2021? I was wrestling with Azure Files and trying to get everything to just *work* with our existing Group Policy. Mapping drives felt simple enough, but then the authentication headaches hit. Azure AD versus local accounts – it was a constant back-and-forth.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps create a different version focusing on a specific angle (like the authentication challenge)?
