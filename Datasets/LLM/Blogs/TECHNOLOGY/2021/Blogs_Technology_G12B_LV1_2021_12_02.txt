## The Infinite Scroll and the Weight of "Should"

It's 2021, and I feel like I'm constantly battling a low-grade anxiety fueled by… everything. But mostly, by the internet. Specifically, the endless scroll.

I’ve noticed a pattern: I’ll feel this vague sense of *should*. I *should* be learning that new coding language. I *should* be building a portfolio. I *should* be networking more. Then, instead of doing any of those things, I find myself hypnotized by perfectly curated Instagram feeds and Twitter debates that go nowhere.

The guilt piles on. “You’re wasting time!” my internal critic screams. It’s a vicious cycle, and honestly, it's exhausting.

Lately, I've been trying to borrow a little wisdom from Stoicism and mindfulness. The Stoics talked about focusing on what you *can* control, and letting go of what you can't – like the constant influx of information and the pressure to keep up.  Meditative practices, even just five minutes of focused breathing, help quiet that “should” voice.

It’s not about suddenly becoming a productivity machine. It’s about shifting perspective.  Instead of beating myself up for not achieving some arbitrary ideal, I’m trying to acknowledge the feeling, and then gently redirect my energy towards a *single*, small, achievable task. Maybe just writing one line of code. Maybe just replying to one email.

It’s a work in progress, definitely. But recognizing that the endless scroll isn't a reflection of my worth, and that progress, not perfection, is the goal, feels like a small victory. And a much lighter load to carry.
