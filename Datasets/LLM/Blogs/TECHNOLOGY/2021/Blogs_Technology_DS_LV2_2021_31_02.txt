It’s 2021, and I’m sitting at my desk, staring at lines of code for a cellular automaton simulation. I can’t help but marvel at how much it reminds me of life itself—those tiny enzymes and receptors in our cells, working like nature’s own algorithms. I’ve been digging through biological datasets, trying to mirror their elegant chemical pathways in my digital world.

It’s humbling, really. We build these complex systems, yet the most profound inspiration comes from within us. Sometimes, the most advanced technology just echoes what biology has perfected over millennia. Makes you think, doesn’t it?
