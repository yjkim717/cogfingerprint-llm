The glow of my laptop screen is a familiar companion, especially here in the Bay Area. In 2021, my world shrank to this rectangle of code and video calls. I’m an immigrant, a tech worker, and for a long time, my biggest risk was a merge conflict.

But life isn't lived entirely in the cloud. Venturing out to BART or a simple walk home after dark introduced a new kind of variable to my life—safety. My engineer’s mind started calculating probabilities, scanning for exits, weighing the utility of a small, legal self-defense tool in my pocket.

It’s a strange duality. By day, I build digital futures, connecting the world. By night, I’m just a person, navigating the very real, physical world with a newfound caution. It’s a humbling reminder that for all our technology, some of the most critical systems we navigate are human, and they don't always come with a user manual.
