**The Ghosts in Our Screens**

It’s weird, isn't it? How we’ve built these incredible, glowing rectangles – our phones, our laptops – and somehow, they’ve started reflecting back at us a lot of the things we’re trying to escape. I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately, especially as I was working on a story about a character consumed by darkness. 

It struck me that the constant stream of information, the curated outrage, the relentless pressure to *perform* online – it’s a modern form of trauma. Like PTSD, it can leave you feeling perpetually on edge, fueled by a need for vengeance against the perceived injustices of the digital world. 

I’m not saying tech is inherently evil, of course. But the way it’s designed – the endless scroll, the dopamine hits – it can easily trap us in a cycle of negativity.  It’s easy to get lost in the shadows of other people’s carefully constructed realities. 

Just like my villain, we all have a capacity for darkness. The challenge, I think, is finding a way to acknowledge it, to understand its roots, and ultimately, to seek a kind of digital redemption – a conscious choice to build something more nourishing within our screens, and, more importantly, within ourselves.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focus on a specific aspect or adjust the tone?
