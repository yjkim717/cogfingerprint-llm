There’s something uniquely daunting about staring at an unresolved IT ticket when you’re the only one left to solve it. In my old role at a sprawling tech firm, I had a whole team for backup—a collective brain trust for those thorny support issues. But 2021 had other plans, landing me in a smaller shop where the buck stops with me.

The career shift was exciting, but the anxiety is real. Problem-solving now feels intensely personal. Every unfamiliar error message or cryptic system alert is a solo mission. I’m learning to trust my skills more, but some days, I deeply miss the reassuring hum of a team around me, turning panic into progress.
