It’s 2021, and I’m staring at my new Cadillac Escalade, wondering if I’m truly ready for the road ahead. I’ve got the Z82 trailering package, rated for 8,300 pounds—but is that enough? The specs say yes, yet I can’t shake the feeling that without a dedicated trailer brake controller, I’m missing a crucial layer of safety. It’s like having a powerful smartphone but skipping the security updates. Sometimes, the smartest tech choice is the one that prepares you for the unexpected.
