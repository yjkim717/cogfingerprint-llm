### The Unlikely Path to Reading Minds

It’s 2021, and I’m staring at a research proposal for a Master's in Neuroscience. The irony isn’t lost on me. My undergraduate degrees are in Philosophy and English. For years, my world was built of arguments and metaphors, not axons and action potentials. I was trained to deconstruct texts, and now I want to help deconstruct the most complex text of all: the human brain, specifically for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

People often ask me, “Why the switch? You have no formal research experience.” It’s true. I’ve never run a PCR gel or recorded from a neuron. But I’ve spent years training in a different kind of lab—the library. Studying philosophy taught me rigorous logic, how to build a watertight argument from the ground up, and to question every assumption. English taught me about narrative, about the intricate patterns that create meaning. Isn't that what neural signals are? A story written in electricity and chemistry, waiting for the right interpreter?

The pull toward BCIs isn't just academic. The potential is staggering—restoring movement, communication, and autonomy. It feels like meaningful work, the kind that keeps you up at night not from anxiety, but from excitement. I’m not coming from a traditional STEM path, but I see that as a strength. This field needs more than just biologists and engineers; it needs ethicists, storytellers, and systems-thinkers. We need to ask not just "can we," but "should we," and "how will this change what it means to be human?"

So, here I am, armed with my academic prerequisites and a deep-seated belief that my "unconventional" background is my greatest asset. The career transition is daunting, but the logic is sound. The brain doesn’t care what your diploma says; it cares about the quality of the questions you ask. And I’m finally asking the right ones.
