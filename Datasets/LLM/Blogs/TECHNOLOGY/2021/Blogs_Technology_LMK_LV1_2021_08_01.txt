"Rebooting My Life: Navigating Asperger's, Loneliness, and Code"

I'm sitting here in my small apartment in the US, surrounded by the familiar glow of screens and the hum of my computer. It's 2021, and I'm back in the States after a decade abroad in the UK. On the surface, it seems like a great opportunity – a fresh start in a new place, a chance to reconnect with family and old friends. But the truth is, I'm struggling.

As a 40-year-old woman with Asperger's, I've always found social interactions to be a challenge. The nuances of human communication, the unwritten rules, the expectations – it's exhausting. And when you add in the stress of moving to a new country, starting over, and trying to rebuild a life, it can feel overwhelming.

I've always found solace in code. As a software engineer, I love the logic, the problem-solving, the sense of accomplishment when I debug a tricky issue. It's a world where things make sense, where the rules are clear, and where I can lose myself in the flow.

But even in the comfort of my own home, surrounded by the familiar rhythms of coding, I'm not immune to the pangs of loneliness. It's a feeling that's hard to explain – a sense of disconnection, of being adrift in a sea of faces. I've tried to join online communities, attend meetups, and connect with others who share my passions. And while those things have helped, they haven't been a magic bullet.

The hardest part is the feeling that I'm stuck. That I'll never quite fit in, that I'll always be on the outside looking in. The depression that I've learned to manage over the years has started to creep back in, whispering that I'm not good enough, that I'll never be good enough.

It's a hard pill to swallow, but I'm trying to be kinder to myself. I'm reminding myself that it's okay to take things one step at a time, to focus on the small victories – a successful coding session, a good conversation with a friend, a beautiful sunset.

As I sit here, surrounded by the trappings of my tech-filled life, I'm reminded that it's not about the tools or the technology – it's about the people, the connections, and the moments of beauty that make life worth living. I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm determined to take it one line of code at a time.
