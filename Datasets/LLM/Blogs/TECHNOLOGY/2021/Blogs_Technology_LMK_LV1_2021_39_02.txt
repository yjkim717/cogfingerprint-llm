As I dove into the world of yield farming in 2021, I found myself stuck on a crucial question: how to stake my BNB without breaking the bank on fees or settling for mediocre returns.

I was determined to find the perfect balance - and I was not alone. Many were on the same hunt, seeking to maximize their gains in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.
