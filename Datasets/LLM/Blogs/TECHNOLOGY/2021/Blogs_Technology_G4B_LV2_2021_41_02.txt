**The Ghost in the Machine**

It’s funny how tech can sometimes feel… frustratingly vague. I was building a new PC last year, a CyberPowerPC to be exact, and I hit a weird snag. My fancy PWM fans – supposed to adjust speed automatically – were just… stuck. Running at full blast, regardless of the temperature. 

Turns out, it was a simple misconfiguration on the CPU_OPT header, a little ghost in the machine. It really hammered home that even with all the bells and whistles, understanding the basics is *everything*.  Sometimes, the biggest problems have the smallest solutions.
