**The Weight of the Queue**

It’s funny how quickly a feeling can creep in, isn’t it? I was talking to a T1 Analyst friend recently, and he was seriously stressed. He’s a rockstar at his small organization – super reliable, always getting things done – but he’s starting to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of unresolved tickets piling up. 

He’s worried about escalating them, about passing the buck, and honestly, about the potential fallout. It hit me – in smaller companies, everyone feels a bit more exposed. That “work queue” isn't just a list of tasks; it’s a visible representation of where things stand, and sometimes, that can feel incredibly weighty. 

It’s a reminder that even the most technically skilled folks need support and a little grace. What’s your experience been like when feeling the pressure of a growing backlog?
