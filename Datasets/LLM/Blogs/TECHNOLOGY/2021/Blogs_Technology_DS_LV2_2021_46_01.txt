It was 3 AM when the alert screamed through my headset—Zone Query Overload. I’d been wrestling with our Windows Server 2016 DNS monitoring for weeks, trying to tame the chaos. In 2021, with everything shifting online, every hiccup felt like a personal failure.

Sitting there, bleary-eyed, I realized it wasn’t just about setting thresholds in SCOM or crafting the perfect report. It was about understanding the rhythm of our digital heartbeat. Each spike told a story—a surge in traffic, a new service launch. I learned to listen, not just react. Sometimes, the most technical problems teach the most human lessons: patience and perspective.
