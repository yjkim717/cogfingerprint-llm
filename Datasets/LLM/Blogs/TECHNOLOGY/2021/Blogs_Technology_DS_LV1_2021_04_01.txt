It’s 2021, and I’m deep into my crypto journey, swapping Bitcoin for Cardano in my Exodus wallet. The process was smooth—until I saw the $80 fee on my $400 exchange. Ouch. A quick check on Binance showed I could’ve done it for a fraction of the cost. It’s a reminder that in the rush toward decentralization, convenience often comes at a premium. As much as I love sleek interfaces, sometimes the old-school exchanges still have their place. Lesson learned: always compare before you commit.
