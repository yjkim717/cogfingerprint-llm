**The Frustrating Case of NextJS's Elusive Meta Tags**

As I sat in front of my screen, staring at the seemingly endless lines of code, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over me. I was in the midst of building a NextJS project, and everything was going smoothly - until I hit a roadblock. My meta tags, which were supposed to be dynamically generated using the `next/head` component, were only rendering on the client-side.

At first, I thought it was just a simple matter of misconfiguring the `Head` component. I double-checked the documentation, made sure I was using it correctly, and even tried a few different approaches. But no matter what I did, those meta tags just wouldn't render on the server-side. It was as if they were being stubborn, refusing to cooperate.

It wasn't until I dug deeper into the NextJS documentation that I stumbled upon the issue. I was using `getInitialProps` to fetch data on the server-side, but I wasn't properly passing the data down to my page component. As a result, the `Head` component wasn't receiving the necessary props to generate the meta tags.

The problem was that `getInitialProps` is a static method that gets called on the server-side, but it's not automatically called on the client-side. So, when I was trying to access the data fetched in `getInitialProps` in my page component, it was `undefined` on the client-side. It made sense, in a frustrating kind of way.

The solution was to use the `getStaticProps` method instead, which allows you to pre-render pages at build time. Alternatively, I could have used a library like `next-dynamic-meta-tags` to handle the dynamic meta tags for me.

As I finally got my meta tags rendering correctly on the server-side, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. It was a tough nut to crack, but the sense of accomplishment was worth it. If you're struggling with a similar issue, I hope my experience can save you some time and frustration. And if you're a seasoned NextJS developer, I'd love to hear about your own experiences with dynamic meta tags in the comments below!
