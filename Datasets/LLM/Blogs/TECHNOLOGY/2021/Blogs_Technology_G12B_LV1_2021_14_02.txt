## The Feature Creep That Ate My Productivity (and Maybe Yours Too)

Remember back in 2020 when we were all collectively deciding which Zoom filters best represented our current emotional state? Good times. But 2021 has felt different. It's felt…full. Overflowing. And a lot of that has to do with the relentless march of feature creep in the apps and services we rely on every single day.

I've been thinking a lot about it lately, particularly when trying to actually *get work done*. I’m a writer, and for years, I happily used a simple text editor. Clean, minimal, distraction-free. Bliss. Then, slowly, subtly, it started getting…more. "Smart" features. Collaboration tools. Built-in grammar checkers that aggressively suggest changes I don’t want. Now, it feels like I’m battling the software just to write a single sentence.

It reminds me of those video games that add a bunch of new mechanics halfway through. Suddenly, you’re juggling five different systems when you just wanted to jump and shoot. It can derail the entire experience. The core fun, the original appeal, gets buried under layers of complexity.

And it's not just writing tools. Think about your social media feeds, your project management software, even your email client. They’re all constantly being layered with "improvements" that, frankly, just make things more confusing. I recently spent fifteen minutes trying to figure out why my calendar app had started automatically scheduling meetings I hadn’t agreed to. Fifteen minutes! Time I could have spent, you know, actually doing something.

I wonder if the drive for constant innovation sometimes overwhelms the need for simplicity and usability. Are we so focused on *adding* things that we forget to consider what we might be taking away? The elegance of a streamlined workflow? The joy of focused work?

Maybe, just maybe, a little less "smart" and a little more "simple" is exactly what we need in 2021.  I'm seriously considering going back to that old text editor.  Anyone else feeling the feature creep blues?
