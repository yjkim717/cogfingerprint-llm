**The Silent Threat in Your Virtual World**

Remember that feeling when your computer just… slowed to a crawl? It’s a frustrating experience, right?

A ruthless cleanup and a commitment to ongoing monitoring. It’s a surprisingly common issue, and a good reminder to regularly prune our digital landscapes, ensuring everything is working efficiently.
