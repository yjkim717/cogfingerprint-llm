**Wallet Woes and a Question of Convenience**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 was *the* year crypto felt like it was finally hitting the mainstream. I was diving headfirst, experimenting with different wallets, and trying to streamline my trades. I’d heard great things about Exodus, especially its built-in exchange feature. 

I was swapping Bitcoin for Cardano, and that’s when it hit me – a shockingly high fee. Seriously, it felt like the wallet was actively trying to discourage me! It made me stop and think: is the convenience of an all-in-one wallet *really* worth the hidden costs?  It’s a frustrating reminder that even in the exciting world of crypto, careful consideration is key. What are your experiences with exchange fees?
