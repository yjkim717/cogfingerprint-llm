As a software engineer visiting the UK on a tourist visa in 2021, I found myself in a tricky spot. With the tech industry booming, recruiters were reaching out nonstop, eager to chat about potential opportunities. But, I was hesitant to respond, fearing I might inadvertently breach my visa terms. The UK work visa rules can be complex, and the last thing I wanted was to jeopardize my stay. I was stuck, torn between exploring potential career prospects and adhering to the restrictions of my tourist visa. It's ironic that in today's digital age, where remote work is increasingly common, the lines between personal and professional life can get blurred - especially when you're in a foreign country. As I navigated this dilemma, I realized that many others might be facing similar challenges, highlighting the need for clarity on visa rules for tech professionals on the move.
