## The Desktop Dance: My Frustrations with CS:GO and Alt-Tabbing

Okay, so I've been wrestling with something *really* frustrating in CS:GO lately. Anyone else ever experience this? I’m playing in fullscreen 4:3 stretched (yes, I’m old school!), and whenever I try to alt-tab out – maybe to quickly check Spotify or Discord – the game just… kicks me right back to the desktop. Full screen, no warning, just *bam*.

It’s beyond annoying when you're trying to coordinate with your team. Like, "Just gotta quickly see if my friend needs help!" and then *poof*, you're staring at your desktop background. I’ve been scouring forums, trying different launch options, but nothing seems to completely fix it. 

Anyone else having this issue? Any magical solutions I'm missing? Let me know in the comments – I'm desperate!
