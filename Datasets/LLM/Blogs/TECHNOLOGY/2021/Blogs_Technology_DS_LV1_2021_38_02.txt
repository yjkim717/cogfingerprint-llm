Looking back to 2021, I remember wrestling with my grad school apps, wondering if a general neuroscience master’s was the right path into computational neuro or neuroengineering. It felt like trying to learn the rules of a game while everyone else was already playing. I dove into course catalogs, piecing together a plan heavy on math and coding. That deliberate coursework mapping was my bridge—turning uncertainty into a focused launchpad toward the PhD I wanted. Sometimes the scenic route gets you there best.
