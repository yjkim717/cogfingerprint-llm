**The Algorithm’s Echo**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Scrolling through my feed in 2021, it felt like half the games were dominated by Urf, Fioras, Ezreals, and Yuumis. Like the algorithm had decided those were *the* champions to play, relentlessly pushing them to everyone.  I started feeling this weird…boredom. It wasn’t about the game itself, but about the predictable nature of it all. 

I remembered a friend suggesting a build – focusing on Bruiser Rumble and Riftmaker – a way to actually *survive* and counter that tidal wave.  It was a reminder that sometimes, finding a unique approach is the best way to break free from the echo of what’s trending.
