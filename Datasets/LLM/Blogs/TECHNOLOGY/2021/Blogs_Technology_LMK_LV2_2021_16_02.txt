"Getting Lost in Baldur's Gate 3: A Cry for Clarity in 2021 Gaming

As I dove into Baldur's Gate 3 in the summer of 2021, I found myself bewildered by the game's complex mechanics. Larian's masterpiece, while rich in depth, left me yearning for a guiding light - a tutorial to illuminate the mysteries of dice rolls and combat intricacies. Hours were spent deciphering the rules, only to be met with frustration and confusion. 

I wasn't alone in my struggle; many fellow players echoed my sentiments online. The lack of in-game tutorials led to a steep learning curve, deterring some from fully immersing themselves in the world of Faerun. As a gamer, I crave not just complexity, but also clarity. In an era where gaming is more accessible than ever, it's surprising that a game as engaging as Baldur's Gate 3 doesn't offer more guidance. Here's hoping Larian listens to our pleas and sheds light on the intricacies of their game."
