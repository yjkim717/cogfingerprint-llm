**Lost in a Sea of Pixels: Building My Own Rainbow**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple desire – to just *make* something beautiful – can lead you down a rabbit hole of microcontrollers and LEDs. Lately, I’ve been completely consumed by building an RGB LED lamp using a Raspberry Pi and a few WS2812B chips. It’s surprisingly… meditative. 

Honestly, I started it as a weekend project, a little distraction from the endless scrolling. But now I’m wrestling with grounding – a surprisingly crucial detail! – and figuring out the best way to mount everything neatly.  The power supply is a constant worry, ensuring a stable flow for all those little lights.

There’s something deeply satisfying about taking a bunch of electronic components and coaxing them into creating a shifting, vibrant display. It feels a bit like building a tiny, digital rainbow. It’s a reminder that even in 2021, with all the noise of the internet, you can still find joy in hands-on creation.  Anyone else finding solace in tinkering lately?
