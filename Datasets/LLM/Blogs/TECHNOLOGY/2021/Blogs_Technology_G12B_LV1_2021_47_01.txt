>## The Printer's Rebellion and My Tech Frustrations of 2021

Okay, so I’m officially adding printers to the list of things that test my patience in 2021. It feels like everything this year has thrown a curveball, and my trusty Lexmark e260dn is no exception.

We recently moved, a chaotic, cardboard-box-filled adventure, and ever since, this printer has been…off. It started subtly, with a few jammed pages here and there, easily dismissed. But now? It's throwing a full-blown error. The paper tray is *full*, I’ve triple-checked, yet it insists there's a problem. 

The worst part? I’m pretty sure it’s related to a toner leak. A dark smudge on the desk, a faint smell… it's not a good sign. I’ve been avoiding it, hoping it would magically resolve itself. You know, the classic "if I ignore it, maybe it'll go away" strategy.

It’s a strangely frustrating feeling, isn’t it? Relying on these machines, these bits of technology we’ve integrated so seamlessly into our lives, and then having them decide to stage a rebellion. It's like a tiny, mechanical middle finger. I’m contemplating a firmware update, but the thought of wrestling with drivers and online manuals feels exhausting. 

Anyone else feeling the tech fatigue this year? I swear, sometimes I miss the simplicity of pen and paper.
