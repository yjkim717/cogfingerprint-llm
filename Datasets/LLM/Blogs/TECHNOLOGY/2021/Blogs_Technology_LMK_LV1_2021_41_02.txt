"My CyberpowerPC build was a beast, but I hit a snag in 2021. I connected my case fans to the CPU_OPT header, expecting smooth PWM control. However, they ran constantly on DC power instead. After some research, I discovered that my motherboard didn't support PWM on that header. I ended up using a different fan header and all was well. A valuable lesson learned: always double-check your motherboard manual!"
