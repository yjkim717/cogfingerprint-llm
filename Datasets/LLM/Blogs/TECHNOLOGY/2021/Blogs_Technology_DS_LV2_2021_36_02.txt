It’s 2021, and my Monero mining rig feels like a moody artist. I set it up in the corner, dedicated and remote, expecting smooth performance. But the hashrate? It’s all over the place—peaks and valleys for no clear reason. No other tasks, just pure mining. It’s frustrating, like a car that sputters even on an empty highway. Makes me wonder if technology, for all its precision, has a personality of its own. Anyone else’s rig feeling temperamental?
