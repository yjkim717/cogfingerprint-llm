**The Ghost in the System**

It’s weird, right? How easily we start trusting algorithms? I was scrolling through Reddit last week, and stumbled across a story about a guy getting slapped with a bunch of tickets for a car he swears he’s never driven. The DMV insisted he owned it, citing some digital record… a record he had absolutely no recollection of. 

It got me thinking about how reliant we are on these systems – our licenses, our online accounts, even our car registrations.  It’s convenient, sure. But what happens when the ‘system of truth’ glitches? What if there’s a ghost in the machine, a mistake that suddenly makes *you* the owner of something you don’t recognize?  It’s a little unsettling, isn’t it?  Makes you wonder just how much control we *really* have.
