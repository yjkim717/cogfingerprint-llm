"I'll be the first to admit it - I was duped by the hype surrounding the Markus chair. Touted as the ultimate ergonomic office chair, I thought I'd finally found my holy grail. Fast forward a few months, and I'm regretting my purchase. The armrests, while stylish, refuse to budge - a major drawback for someone who switches between sitting and standing throughout the day. And don't even get me started on the lumbar support - or lack thereof. As someone who spends hours hunched over their laptop, I need a chair that can keep up. Unfortunately, the Markus chair falls short. After a long day, I'm left with a nagging back pain that's become all too familiar. In 2021, with all the tech advancements we've made, I expect more from my office chair. It's time to rethink my setup and find a chair that truly supports my body - and my productivity."
