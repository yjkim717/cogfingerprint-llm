**The Algorithm & My Anxiety**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 felt like a year of staring at screens. Applying to college was *intense*, and I definitely fell down the rabbit hole of trying to optimize everything. I spent way too much time scrolling through CollegeVine’s college rankings, obsessing over “best schools” and “top programs” like CS. 

There’s something incredibly unsettling about letting an algorithm dictate your dreams, isn’t there? I felt this pressure to build the *perfect* list, meticulously curated to impress admissions officers. It wasn’t about finding a place where *I* would thrive, but about fitting a mold. 

Honestly, it was exhausting. It took a good chunk of my senior year to realize that my college list should be a reflection of *my* interests and goals, not a score from a website.  Anyone else feel this way?
