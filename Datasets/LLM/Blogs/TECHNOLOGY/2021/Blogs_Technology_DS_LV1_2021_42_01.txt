Back in 2021, I was cleaning out old project folders when I rediscovered my grad school notes on SVMs and kernel methods. They felt like ancient relics next to the buzz around deep learning and XGBoost. It made me pause—were these elegant, non-linear variants truly obsolete, or just overshadowed? Sometimes, the flashiest tools aren’t always the right fit. Maybe there’s still wisdom in those quieter, foundational techniques we’ve left on the shelf.
