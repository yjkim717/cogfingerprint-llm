### The Ghosts in the Machine: A Lesson in Digital Housekeeping

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2021, we talk about the cloud and virtual desktops as if they’re this ethereal, limitless space. But sometimes, the most futuristic tech problems have surprisingly old-school solutions. I was reminded of this recently when our VMware Horizon environment started throwing cryptic provisioning errors. Our pool of instant clones, usually so reliable, was suddenly choking.

The culprit? Our VSAN was running out of component capacity. It felt like a plumbing crisis in a digital skyscraper—the pipes were clogged, and no new tenants could move in. After digging through logs and feeling that familiar admin dread, I found the ghosts in the machine: orphaned VMDK files.

These were virtual hard disks that Horizon thought it had deleted but were still lurking in the VSAN datastore, silently consuming precious resources. They were the digital equivalent of leaving the lights on in empty rooms. The automation had hiccuped, and it was up to me, the human, to do the manual housekeeping.

With a deep breath and a triple-checked backup, I manually identified and deleted those phantom files. It was a simple fix, but it carried a powerful reminder. As we layer on abstraction and automation, we can’t forget the foundational layers. The cloud has a physical reality, a finite nature. Sometimes, you still need to roll up your sleeves, open the virtual closet, and take out the trash. It’s a humble, hands-on lesson in an age of intelligent systems.
