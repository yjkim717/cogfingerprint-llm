"Web scraping woes in 2021 - a tale of Selenium struggles! I was on a mission to extract some juicy text from a webpage, but those elements just wouldn't cooperate. I needed to target a div with class 'b' that followed an 'h1.important' header. Xpath or CSS selector? The eternal debate. After some trial and error, I landed on a working CSS selector: 'h1.important + div.b'. Victory! Selenium's element location strategies can be finicky, but with persistence and the right syntax, even the most stubborn text can be extracted."
