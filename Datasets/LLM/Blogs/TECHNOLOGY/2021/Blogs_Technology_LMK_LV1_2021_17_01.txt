"Migrating to Java 11 was a big step for our team in 2021. We had been on Java 8 for a while, and it was time to upgrade. Everything seemed to go smoothly at first, but then we started hitting some snags. One of the most frustrating issues was with our regex patterns. They just weren't matching like they used to. We were using the same code, the same data, but somehow it just wasn't working. It wasn't until we upgraded to Java 16 that we realized it wasn't just a one-off glitch. The problem was with the way Java 11 and later handled regex pattern matching. It turned out that some subtle changes in the underlying implementation were causing our patterns to fail. We had to go back and revisit our code, tweaking the patterns to get them working again. It was a good learning experience, but definitely not what we had planned for our Java upgrade project!"
