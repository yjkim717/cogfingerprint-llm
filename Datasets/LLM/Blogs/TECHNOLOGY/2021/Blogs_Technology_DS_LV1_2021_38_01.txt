### From Thought to Code: My Leap into Neuroscience

It’s 2021, and I’ve spent the last year watching my world shrink to the size of a laptop screen. In that little rectangle, I saw two futures collide. One was of isolation and distance. The other, the one that truly captured me, was of connection—specifically, the kind that might one day let us connect a human mind to a machine.

My background is in philosophy. I’ve spent years wrestling with questions of consciousness and what it means to be. But staring at the relentless pace of technology during the pandemic, my abstract questions became urgent and practical. If a device can interpret the electrical whispers of my somatic sensory neurons to move a robotic arm, where does the "self" end and the machine begin? I realized I didn't just want to think about these questions anymore; I wanted to help build the answers.

So, I’m doing something that feels equal parts terrifying and inevitable: I’m applying for a Master's in Neuroscience. Me, someone whose last formal science class was in high school. The path from reading Descartes to designing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) isn't exactly a straight line. The coursework is daunting, a new language of ions and action potentials I have to learn.

But here’s what keeps me going: neuroengineering isn't just about technology. It’s the ultimate applied philosophy. It’s the tangible bridge between the inner world of experience and the outer world of creation. My goal isn't to leave my humanities background behind, but to build upon it. I want to be part of a generation that doesn't just use technology, but thoughtfully, carefully, weaves it into the very fabric of human sensation and understanding. The screen may be small for now, but the future it hints at is boundless.
