Back in 2021, wrestling with TypeScript’s strict types, I felt like I was in a Monty Python sketch—arguing over whether a duck was truly a duck. Then I discovered duck typing. It wasn’t about rigid labels, but what something could do. That simple JavaScript pattern reminded me: sometimes, flexibility and trust in capability matter more than perfect definitions. A liberating lesson in code and life.
