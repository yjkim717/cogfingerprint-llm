My Monero mining rig has become a temperamental artist in 2021. One moment, the hashrate purrs along steadily, a testament to my computer's quiet dedication. The next, it stutters and dips for no discernible reason. I've checked everythingâ€”no other programs running, no network hiccups. It's just me and this machine, and its mysterious, fluctuating rhythm. This quest for stability has turned into a personal puzzle, a quiet reflection on how even the most logical systems can harbor a little unpredictable soul. It keeps me guessing, and honestly, a little captivated.
