It’s 2021, and I’ve been thinking a lot about the villains in our favorite tech stories—the shadowy corporations, the rogue AIs, the data hoarders. It’s tempting to paint them as purely evil, but what if we explored their “dark side” with more nuance?  

Imagine a developer who, in pursuit of innovation, crosses ethical lines—not out of malice, but from a fractured mental state fueled by burnout and isolation. Their story isn’t just about chaos; it’s about the struggle for redemption. Maybe they realize the harm they’ve caused and begin the slow, painful work of rebuilding trust, rewriting code, and healing themselves in the process.  

In a world where tech moves faster than our moral compass, these complex characters remind us that behind every system, there’s a person—flawed, human, and capable of change. Let’s tell stories where the “villain” isn’t just a cautionary tale but a mirror reflecting our own potential for growth.
