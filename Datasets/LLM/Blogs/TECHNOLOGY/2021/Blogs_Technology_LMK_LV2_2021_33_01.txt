"Gaming on Brave: The Elusive Smooth Ride. I was excited to dive into Krunker IO on my Brave browser in 2021, but I was frustrated to find my frame rate switching between 60 and 120 FPS. Despite tweaking settings for higher frame rates and disabling the FPS cap, the issue persisted. I even toggled hardware acceleration, but the problem remained. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm still on the hunt for a solution to enjoy a seamless gaming experience."
