It’s 2021, and I’m planning my first cross-Canada road trip since the world started opening up again. I’ve spent hours scrolling through Ontario’s lesser-known gems on my phone, but the digital noise is overwhelming. I remember the old days of unfolding a giant paper map across the kitchen table, tracing routes with a finger, and calling small-town visitor centers for advice.

Now, a single app promises the perfect itinerary. It’s efficient, yes, but it lacks the soul of those human conversations. I wonder if technology, for all its convenience, has smoothed out the delightful, unplanned detours. As I finalize my route, I’m making a pact with myself: use the tech for safety and logistics, but leave room for the unexpected charm only a real, un-curated stop can provide.
