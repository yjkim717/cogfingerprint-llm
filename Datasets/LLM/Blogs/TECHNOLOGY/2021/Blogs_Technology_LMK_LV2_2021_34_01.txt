As I hooked up my trailer to my trusty 2019 Cadillac Escalade Platinum in 2021, I realized that towing at the maximum weight of 8,300 lbs requires more than just a strong vehicle. I needed the right trailering equipment, including a reliable trailer break controller. It made me appreciate how far towing technology has come. With advancements in towing capacity and safety features, I felt confident on the road. It's amazing how technology can transform a potentially daunting task into a seamless experience.
