Looking back at my 2021 hardware swap, I remember scoring a Corsair CX750M PSU for just $75. It came with all its original SATA and PCIe cables, practically untouched. That little upgrade taught me something—sometimes the best tech isn’t the newest or flashiest, but the reliable piece that fits just right. It’s a reminder that in our fast-paced digital world, value and function often outshine pure novelty.
