Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and keeping the 2021 context in mind. I've focused on a theme of technological promises versus reality, drawing a parallel to the interview experience you mentioned.  I've aimed for around 177 words.  Let me know what you think, and I can revise it!

## The Metaverse Hype and My Last Job Interview

Remember all the Metaverse buzz in 2021? Everyone was talking about virtual worlds, digital ownership, and the next evolution of the internet. It felt…promising, exciting even. Like a shiny new frontier.

Funny enough, it reminded me of a recent job interview I had. I walked in feeling optimistic, ready to showcase my skills. Instead, I spent an hour listening to a manager drone on about vague future projects, offering platitudes about “potentially keeping in touch” without a concrete offer. 

It was a masterclass in wasting time, really. 

And that’s the thing about technology, isn’t it? The potential is often dazzling, the promises alluring. But the reality can be a frustrating gap between what *could* be and what *is*.  We get caught up in the hype, the demos, the flashy presentations… and sometimes forget to ask, "Is this actually delivering?"

The Metaverse might still change everything. But that interview? That felt like a stark reminder to keep my feet firmly planted on the ground.
