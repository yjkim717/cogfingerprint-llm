It’s 2021, and I thought technology was supposed to make life easier. But here I am, tangled in a digital nightmare that feels straight out of a Kafka novel. It started with a DMV registration error—some glitch in their system linked a stranger’s license plates to my name. Now, tickets I didn’t earn keep piling up, and no amount of online forms or calls seems to fix it. I even filed a police report, but the automated replies feel like shouting into the void. In an age where we can video chat across the globe, why can’t we untangle a simple bureaucratic mistake? It’s a stark reminder that behind every sleek interface, human error still reigns.
