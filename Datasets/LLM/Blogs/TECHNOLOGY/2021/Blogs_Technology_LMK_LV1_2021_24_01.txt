"I'm still scratching my head over my CS:GO struggles in Matchmaking. Despite consistently performing well on Faceit, where the competition is fierce, I find myself getting outplayed in MM. Specifically, I'm having trouble holding angles and reacting to opponents. It's frustrating because I can track enemies just fine in Faceit, but somehow that skill isn't translating. As I sit here in 2021, surrounded by my gaming setup, I'm reminded that sometimes it's the little things that need tweaking - maybe it's time to revisit my aim training exercises."
