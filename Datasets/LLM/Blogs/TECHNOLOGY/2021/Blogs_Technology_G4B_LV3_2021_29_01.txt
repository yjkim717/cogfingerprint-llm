**Digging Deeper: The Quest for More in C3**

It’s funny how sometimes, the most exciting programming challenges aren’t about building *new* things, but about making existing tools do *more*. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with C3, my little programming language, and specifically, how we handle type aliases and function names.  I’m aiming for something that feels a bit like C’s preprocessor – a way to really sculpt and refine code at a higher level. 

I’m looking at how other languages handle this, and honestly, it’s sparked a real curiosity. It’s about crafting a system that feels less like a rigid rulebook and more like a powerful extension to the code itself.  It’s a slow process, but a rewarding one!
