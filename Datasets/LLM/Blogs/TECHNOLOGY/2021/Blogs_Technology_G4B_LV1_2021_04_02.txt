**Scrolling Through the Noise**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How quickly the internet can morph into a battleground. I’ve been spending a lot of time on YouTube lately, trying to keep up with the news – and frankly, feeling increasingly overwhelmed. Lately, I’ve been noticing a disturbing trend: a constant stream of UK news videos riddled with anti-vaccine commentary and, honestly, some pretty nasty harassment directed at anyone who *does* support vaccination. 

It’s baffling. I get the skepticism, the need for critical thinking, but the level of vitriol feels… unproductive. It’s like people are actively trying to scare each other away from a genuinely important public health measure. 

I remember 2020 vividly – the fear, the uncertainty. Now, we have a vaccine. And yet, this echo chamber of misinformation keeps bubbling up, fueled by algorithms and, I suspect, a desire to feel ‘right’. It makes you wonder about the role technology plays in amplifying division, doesn’t it?  It’s a frustrating reminder that connecting online doesn't always equal connection.
