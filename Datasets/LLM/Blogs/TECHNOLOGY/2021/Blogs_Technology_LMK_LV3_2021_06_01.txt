As I sat glued to Kitboga's Twitch stream, watching him expertly scambait unsuspecting scammers, I couldn't help but think about the immense preparation that goes into creating such an engaging experience. Kitboga, a pioneer in the scambaiting community, has built a massive following by wasting scammers' time and entertaining his audience. While his stream is undeniably high-quality, I believe he could take it to the next level by refining his pre-call preparation. A little more research on the scammers' tactics, having a few more scripts up his sleeve, or even anticipating potential call flows could make his interactions even more convincing and hilarious. With Twitch streaming becoming increasingly popular in 2021, Kitboga's attention to detail could set a new standard for scambaiting content creators. By fine-tuning his preparation, Kitboga could continue to captivate his audience and make his stream an even more unmissable experience.
