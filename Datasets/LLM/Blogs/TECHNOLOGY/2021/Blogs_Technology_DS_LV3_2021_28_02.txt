It’s 2021, and I’m staring at my screen, paralyzed by college applications. Everyone says computer science is the future, but how do I find the right program? CollegeVine’s algorithm keeps suggesting safety and target schools, and I’m torn. Do I trust a website to map out my future? It feels like outsourcing a life decision. I want a strong CS education, but not just anywhere. Is a computer really the best guide for a path built on human dreams and late-night coding passion? The doubt is real.
