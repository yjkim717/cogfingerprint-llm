**The Algorithm and the Echo Chamber**

Remember back in 2021 when everyone was talking about “going viral”? It felt… urgent, didn’t it? Like a single tweet or TikTok could suddenly shift the whole political landscape. I was scrolling, feeling this weird mix of excitement and anxiety as I watched a completely unknown candidate announce their campaign – a campaign built on a platform so nebulous it was practically a riddle. 

It made me think about how easily we get pulled into these digital echo chambers. We’re fed content that confirms our existing beliefs, and suddenly, disagreement feels like *discord*.  Like that rally with the macaroni salad – a deliberately strange detail designed to grab attention and, maybe, signal something deeper. 

We crave connection, but are we truly connecting, or just finding people who already agree with us? It’s a question I still wrestle with, especially in a world dominated by algorithms.
