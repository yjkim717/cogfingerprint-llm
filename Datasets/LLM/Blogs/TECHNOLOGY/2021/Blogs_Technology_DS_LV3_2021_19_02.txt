It’s 2021, and I’m sitting here feeling a bit like my level 7 Lore Bard in our weekly D&D game—overwhelmed by options but somehow limited. I’ve been diving into new productivity apps, AI tools, and automation scripts, treating them like spells in my digital arsenal. But just like my Bard’s finite “spells known,” I can only master so many at once.

I keep downloading new apps, hoping they’ll unlock some next-level efficiency, only to realize I’m just juggling interfaces instead of casting meaningful "spells." The tech world promises infinite customization, yet here I am, questioning if I’m preparing the right tools for the quests ahead—work, creativity, connection.

Maybe the magic isn’t in hoarding every digital incantation, but in wisely choosing the ones that truly resonate. Less clutter, more focus. Now, if only my Bard had that figured out, too.
