**The Tightrope of Tech Support**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2021, as everyone’s glued to their screens, I found myself genuinely wrestling with a quiet panic about my IT support role at a small company. When a problem wouldn’t budge, the thought of escalating it – admitting defeat, essentially – felt terrifying. 

There’s a weird pressure, especially when you’re the first line of defense. You worry about looking incompetent, or worse, that it’ll reflect poorly on *you*.

It’s about recognizing your limits and trusting the team – and ultimately, delivering the best support possible.
