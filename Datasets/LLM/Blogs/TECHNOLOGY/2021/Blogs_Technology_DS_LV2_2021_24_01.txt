There I was, clutching my mouse, peeking mid on Dust II for what felt like the hundredth time. On Faceit’s 128-tick servers, I’m a rock, holding angles with confidence. But back in 64-tick matchmaking? I’m Swiss cheese. The enemy just seems to materialize and shoot me before I even see them. It’s 2021, and this tiny technological difference in server tick rate is the invisible wall between feeling like a pro and a complete noob. The struggle is painfully real.
