**The Quiet Pull of the Algorithm**

Remember scrolling through Instagram in 2021, feeling… restless? Not necessarily angry, but a low-grade sense of unease? I started noticing it with certain accounts – “Old Leechs,” as I jokingly called them. These weren’t overtly aggressive, just consistently offering a specific kind of validation. 

It felt oddly comforting, this curated echo chamber.  A little bit of attachment to the approval of strangers, a subtle psychological game played entirely through carefully crafted posts.  It was a quiet trade-off: a momentary feeling of belonging for a slow erosion of my own sense of self. 

It made me wonder – are we all, in some way, drawn to these digital Leeches, preferring the gentle pull of validation to the messy, immediate challenges of real life?  It's a question that still lingers, isn’t it?
