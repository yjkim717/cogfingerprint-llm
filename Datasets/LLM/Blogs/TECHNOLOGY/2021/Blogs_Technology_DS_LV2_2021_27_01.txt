You know that feeling when your phone updates overnight, and suddenly everything’s just… different? That was me this morning, squinting at a rearranged home screen.

It got me thinking about 2021—how we’ve all had to adapt to so much change, so fast. We upgraded our tech for Zoom calls, learned new apps to stay connected, and now our own devices are evolving without us. It’s a strange comfort, in a way. If my clumsy phone can learn a new layout, maybe I can, too. Here’s to growing, even when it feels like starting from scratch.
