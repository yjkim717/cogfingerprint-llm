"I was excited to try Exodus Wallet's exchange feature in 2021, but my enthusiasm was short-lived. After swapping $400 worth of Bitcoin for Cardano, I was shocked to see the transaction fees eat into my profits. To my dismay, I lost around $80 in fees! I couldn't help but wonder if the convenience was worth it. As I dug deeper, I realized I was not alone in my frustration. Has the ease of use come at a steep price? I'm still weighing the pros and cons, and questioning the true value of this feature."
