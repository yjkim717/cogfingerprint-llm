**The Hunt for ‘Interesting’**

It’s funny how a simple task can suddenly feel like a detective case. Last year, I was wrestling with Selenium – trying to scrape a specific piece of text from a website. My goal? Find the word “Interesting” that always followed an `<h1>` tag with the class “important”. 

Turns out, it wasn’t about the *why*, but the *how* – mastering XPath and selectors. It really highlighted how powerful (and sometimes frustrating!) code can be when you're staring at a screen, hunting for that one elusive element.  Sometimes, the most satisfying finds are the small ones.
