"Stuck in the past, my old MacBook was running Yosemite 10.10.5. I wanted to upgrade to El Capitan, but the App Store was no help. Fast forward to 2021, and I'm still amazed at how frustrating it was. Apple had removed older OS updates from the App Store, leaving me clueless. I finally found a workaround by searching directly on Apple's support site. A simple solution, but one that required some digging. Has anyone else had a similar issue?"
