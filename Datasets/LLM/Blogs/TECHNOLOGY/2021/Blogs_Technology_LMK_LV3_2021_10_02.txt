As I planned my 2021 cross-Canada road trip, I realized that staying connected in smaller Ontario cities would be a challenge. While mapping out my route, I worried about losing phone signal and missing important updates. But, upon reflection, I saw this as an opportunity to disconnect from technology and reconnect with the world around me. Embracing the slower pace of these hidden gems allowed me to appreciate the beauty of the Canadian landscape without the constant ping of notifications. In a year marked by digital overload, my road trip became a refreshing digital detox, reminding me that sometimes, the best connection is the one you make with yourself.
