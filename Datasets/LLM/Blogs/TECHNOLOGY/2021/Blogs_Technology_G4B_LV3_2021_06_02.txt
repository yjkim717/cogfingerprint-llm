**The Algorithm Said “Yes,” But My Gut Said… Nope.**

It’s 2021, and applying for jobs feels increasingly like battling an algorithm. I’d spent weeks perfecting my online profile, tailoring my resume to every ‘remote customer service’ role I could find. Then, I landed an interview with a company using some really slick AI-powered screening – it felt…efficient, almost sterile. 

The call started promisingly enough, but quickly devolved into a frustrating loop. The hiring manager seemed more interested in testing my technical knowledge than actually assessing if I was a good fit. It felt like a complete waste of my time, a digital echo chamber of pre-programmed questions. 

Honestly, the whole experience left me feeling a deep disappointment.  I’d been so focused on *appearing* perfect to the system that I’d forgotten to just…be myself.  It was a stark reminder that even in a world obsessed with data and automation, genuine connection and *professionalism* – the kind that comes from human interaction – still matter.  Sometimes, you just need to trust your instincts, even when the algorithm says “yes.”
