**The Endless DWM Dance**

Remember those late nights in 2021, staring at a screen, tweaking DWM until it vaguely resembled something… usable? I do. I was chasing that perfect tiling window manager, desperately trying to build a beautiful, efficient workspace from scratch. It felt like a constant battle – a never-ending cycle of customizing the status bar, wrestling with the system clock, and generally feeling like I was fighting the tool instead of letting it work *for* me.

I started to wonder if I was wasting valuable time.  Isn't the point of technology to *simplify* our lives?  I realized I was so focused on the details of DWM that I wasn't actually enjoying my workflow.  Now, I'm exploring tiling WM options that offer a more streamlined, “modern” experience – something that anticipates my needs, not just lets me endlessly adjust it. It’s a shift, but a welcome one.
