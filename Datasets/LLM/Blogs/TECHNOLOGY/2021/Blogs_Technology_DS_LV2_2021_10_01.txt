### The Unplanned Sabbatical My Smartphone Gave Me

It happened last Tuesday. A tragic meeting between my iPhone and a concrete floor left me phoneless for three whole days. My initial panic—how will I check emails? What about my podcast?!—slowly melted into something I didn’t expect: a profound sense of clarity.

In 2021, we’re more connected than ever, yet I’ve never felt more fragmented. My phone was a vortex of notifications, a constant hum of digital static in the background of my life. I was consuming content, creating content, and engaging with my audience, but I’d lost the thread of my own story. I was a creator who had forgotten how to just… be.

Those three days were a crash course in my own mind. I noticed the way the light hit the kitchen table in the afternoon. I finished a book, feeling the actual weight of the pages. I had a single, uninterrupted thought while on a walk, and it was the seed for my next big project—an idea that had been drowned out by the endless scroll.

Getting a new phone felt like stepping back into a noisy room after a quiet meditation. The lesson, for me, wasn’t to abandon technology, but to build a better relationship with it. My creativity isn’t fueled by constant input; it’s nurtured in the quiet spaces in between. Now, I schedule my "offline" hours as diligently as I schedule my posts. It’s the most productive un-productivity I’ve ever practiced.
