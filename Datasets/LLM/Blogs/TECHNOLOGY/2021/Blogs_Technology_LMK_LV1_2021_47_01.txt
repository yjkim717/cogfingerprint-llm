"Frustrating Encounters with My Trusty Lexmark e260dn"

It's 2021, and I'm still relying on my Lexmark e260dn printer to get the job done. However, my trusty printer has been acting up lately. The orange paper LED keeps flashing, indicating a paper tray issue, even though it's full. I've tried restarting it multiple times, but the problem persists. I've been scouring the internet for a firmware update that might resolve the issue, but so far, no luck. I've also checked the printer connection, ensuring it's properly linked to my computer. I'm starting to feel like I'm in a battle with my printer. Has anyone else experienced this issue? I'm desperate for a solution that doesn't involve replacing my reliable Lexmark e260dn. I'm hoping someone out there has a troubleshooting tip or a firmware update that can get my printer back up and running smoothly.
