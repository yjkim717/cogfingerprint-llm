As I navigated the chaotic college admissions landscape in 2021, I found myself relying heavily on CollegeVine for guidance on selecting the right CS program. But as I scrolled through their recommendations, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was missing a personal touch. Was I just a data point in their algorithm? I began to wonder if I should take a step back and trust my instincts when curating my college list. Shouldn't I be more than just a match made by code? It was time to strike a balance between tech and intuition.
