**When New Doesn’t Feel Right**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with something lately, and it feels surprisingly relevant to a lot of the online stuff we’re consuming. It’s about this new augmented reality game that dropped last month – *Echo Bloom*. It looked *amazing* on the trailers: vibrant, immersive, and genuinely innovative. But the more I played, the more I felt this nagging sense of…wrongness. 

It’s like they’d just bolted on a whole new storyline, featuring this character named Silas, and it completely shattered the established lore of the game’s world. The pacing felt rushed, like they were desperately trying to cram everything in. 

It reminded me of how sometimes, the shiny new tech – the coolest app, the flashiest gadget – can feel like it clashes with the foundations of something already good. We get so excited for the *new*, we forget to consider if it actually *fits*.  Anyone else experiencing this lately?
