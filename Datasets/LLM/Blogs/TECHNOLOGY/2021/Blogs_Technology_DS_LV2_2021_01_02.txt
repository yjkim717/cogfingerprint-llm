It’s 2021, and my shoulder strap bag feels like a time capsule. Inside: my laptop, a tangle of charging cables, and dog-eared notes on Python loops. As a computer science student, I’ve learned it’s not just a bag—it’s my mobile command center. Each scuff tells a story: the late-night library session, the coffee shop debugging marathon. It carries the weight of my code and my ambitions. Funny how the simplest tools ground us in a digital world, reminding me that even in tech, the human touch starts with what we carry.
