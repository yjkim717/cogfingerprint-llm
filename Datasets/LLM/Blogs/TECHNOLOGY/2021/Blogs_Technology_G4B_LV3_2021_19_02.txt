Okay, here’s a blog post draft inspired by the D&D summary and aiming for that reflective, conversational tone with a 2021 feel:

**The Illusion of Knowing Everything**

Remember staring at your phone in 2021, convinced you *knew* everything? Seriously, the internet felt like a boundless library, and we were all just frantically skimming the surface, trying to absorb it all. It’s a surprisingly D&D-like feeling, isn’t it? 

I was playing a Lore Bard last year, and I kept getting tripped up by the difference between what I could *prepare* – those carefully chosen spells ready for battle – and what I *knew* – the whole repertoire bubbling in my mind. It hit me: we’re all like that Bard, constantly battling the limits of our capacity. 

Just because we can access a staggering amount of information doesn’t mean we truly *understand* it.  We’re overloaded, constantly chasing the next notification, the next headline, the next fleeting trend.  Maybe the real skill isn’t knowing *everything*, but knowing *what to focus* on – just like a Bard carefully selecting their spells for the journey ahead.
