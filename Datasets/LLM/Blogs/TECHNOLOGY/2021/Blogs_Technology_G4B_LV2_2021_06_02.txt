**The Day My Tech Dreams Hit a Wall**

It’s funny how some memories stick with you, right? I was just thinking back to 2021, a year when I was absolutely convinced I was going to land my dream job at a small software startup. I’d spent months building my CV, really digging into my work experience (mostly freelance web design projects), and feeling pretty confident. 

Then came the interview. It started okay, but quickly spiraled. The manager was… well, let’s just say he wasn’t exactly embodying a supportive environment. It felt incredibly unprofessional, and honestly, a huge waste of my time. 

Looking back, it was a brutal lesson. It really hammered home that a great CV and a positive attitude aren’t always enough. Sometimes, you just have to recognize when a situation isn’t right and move on. It’s a reminder to trust my gut, even when things feel a little disappointing – and to keep honing those technical skills!
