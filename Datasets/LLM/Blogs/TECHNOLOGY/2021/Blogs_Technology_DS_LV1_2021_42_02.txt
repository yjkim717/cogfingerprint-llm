It’s 2021, and I’m knee-deep in a project, staring at these pretrained network weights. They’re incredible, powerful—but the legal gray area is a maze. Can I use them commercially? The code is open-source, but the weights? That’s the real question. It feels like building on a foundation someone else poured, unsure if I need permission to open the doors for business. A reminder that innovation often races ahead of the law.
