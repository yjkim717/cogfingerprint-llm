"In 2021, I found myself pondering the relevance of SVM and kernel methods in a world dominated by deep learning. Are these traditional machine learning stalwarts still worth our attention? As I dug deeper, I realized that non-linear SVM still holds its own, especially when dealing with smaller datasets. But is it enough to keep them in the spotlight, or are they slowly being overshadowed by the mighty neural networks?"
