As I sat in front of my screen in 2021, scrolling mindlessly through my feeds, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The world was still reeling from the pandemic, and our reliance on technology had reached new heights. We were more connected than ever, yet felt increasingly isolated. I began to wonder, had we lost ourselves in the process of staying connected? The dark themes of loneliness and disconnection seemed to be lurking beneath the surface of our digital lives. As I pondered this, I started thinking about how we create characters in stories - like a complex villain struggling with mental health. We weave nuanced narratives to make them relatable. Can we do the same for our digital selves? By being more intentional with our tech use, we can craft a more authentic online presence. It's time to take control of our digital stories and create a healthier relationship with technology.
