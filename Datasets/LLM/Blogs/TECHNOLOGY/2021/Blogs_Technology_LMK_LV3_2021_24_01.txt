"Getting stuck on the same skill plateau in CS:GO can be frustrating. I was stuck in a rut, struggling to hold angles in competitive matchmaking despite being able to track opponents on Faceit. It wasn't until I reflected on my gameplay that I realized my issue wasn't mechanics, but map awareness. By shifting my focus to understanding common routes and hiding spots, I finally started to climb the ranks. Sometimes, it's not about being better, it's about being smarter."
