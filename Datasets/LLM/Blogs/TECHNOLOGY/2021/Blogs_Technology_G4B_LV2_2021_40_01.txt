**The Year I Stopped Fighting My Desktop**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How quickly we can get tangled up in the *how* of technology, completely forgetting the *why*. Last year, I was a DMZ devotee – meticulously tweaking my tiling window manager, DWM, trying to sculpt the perfect, hyper-efficient workspace. Hours vanished into endless configuration files. 

Honestly, it felt… exhausting. I was spending more time wrestling my desktop than actually *using* it.  

Then, I realized I wanted a simple experience. Something that just *worked*.  I’ve since switched to a slightly less customizable option, and the difference is incredible. It’s quieter, more focused, and surprisingly, more productive.  Sometimes, the best upgrade isn’t about adding more bells and whistles, but about stripping away the noise.
