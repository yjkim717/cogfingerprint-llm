**Lost in the Scroll: Why YouTube Feels Like a Parallel Universe**

Remember 2021? It felt… intense. We were still navigating a world dominated by COVID-19, and honestly, a lot of my online time was spent just feeling bewildered. I stumbled across some UK news videos on YouTube recently, and I was struck by how deeply entrenched anti-vaccine beliefs seemed to be. It wasn’t just disagreement; it was a fervent, almost angry conviction. 

It really got me thinking about the ‘online echo chamber’ effect. You start seeing the same arguments repeated, validated by like-minded people, and suddenly, your own doubts and questions get drowned out.  I felt a pang of shame – how easily could *I* have been swayed?  

Scrolling through the comments was like peering into a completely different reality. It’s a stark reminder that the internet, for all its supposed connection, can also be a breeding ground for misinformation. It’s a weird, unsettling feeling, isn’t it? A reminder to always question, to seek out diverse perspectives, and to maybe, just maybe, step away from the endless scroll every now and then.
