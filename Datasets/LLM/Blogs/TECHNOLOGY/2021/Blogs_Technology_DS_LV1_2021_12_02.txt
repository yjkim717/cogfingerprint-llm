### My Phone’s ‘Do Not Disturb’ is My New Stoic Exercise

It’s 2021, and my to-do list lives in my pocket. That’s the problem.

For months, a single notification—"Reply to client email"—would trigger a cascade of mental gymnastics. I’d open my laptop, stare at the blank screen, and suddenly feel an urgent need to reorganize my bookmarks. I was the king of procrastination, cloaked in the cheap robe of "being busy." The guilt was a low-grade hum in the background of my day, a soundtrack curated by my own self-deprecation.

Then I remembered the Stoics. They practiced *prosoché*, attention to your inner state. My modern version? A radical act of perspectivization. Every morning, I turn on "Do Not Disturb" for one focused hour. It’s not just a setting; it’s a spiritual exercise for the digital age.

In that quiet hour, the email isn't a monstrous task. It’s just words that need arranging. By shrinking the digital world, I’ve expanded my own capacity to engage with it, one undistracted task at a time. The hum of guilt has been replaced by the quiet click of the "send" button.
