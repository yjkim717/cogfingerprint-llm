**The Day My Algorithm Went Wrong**

It feels like a lifetime ago, but 2021 was a weird year. I was laser-focused on college applications, obsessing over my SAT score and, frankly, terrified of a GPA slip. Then, it happened. A single bad grade – in a computer science class – sent my overall GPA spiraling. Suddenly, my carefully constructed college “dream” felt like it was crumbling.

I remember staring at my transcript, feeling utterly defeated. It wasn’t just about the numbers; it felt like my entire future was being recalculated by a faulty algorithm.  I seriously considered retaking the SAT, convinced it was the only way back. 

Looking back, it was a valuable lesson. Technology can be amazing, helping us learn and connect, but it shouldn’t dictate our self-worth.  It forced me to realize that setbacks are part of the process and that resilience – not just a perfect score – truly matters.
