As I watched the video based on my thesis, I couldn't help but reflect on the complexities of euthanasia ethics in 2021. The interviews with experts, including a Catholic ethicist, highlighted the nuances of the Groningen protocol and paediatric euthanasia. I realized that technology has made it possible to share diverse perspectives on sensitive topics like euthanasia laws, sparking a global conversation. It's heartening to see how digital platforms can facilitate empathy and understanding, bridging geographical gaps and fostering a more informed discussion on ethics in the digital age.
