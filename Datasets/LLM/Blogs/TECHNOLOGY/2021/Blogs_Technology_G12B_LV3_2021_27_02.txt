Remember those Magic 8-Balls from childhood? Shaking it, asking a question, and accepting the cryptic answer felt strangely powerful.

A genie warlock guided by fate, a divination wizard interpreting chaotic echoes… It’s a fascinating exploration of how we embrace the unpredictable, and how technology, even something as simple as a digital dice roller, can unlock new creative avenues.
