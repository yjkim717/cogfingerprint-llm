## The Algorithm Knew Me Better Than I Knew Myself

It's weird, isn't it, how much tech *knows*? Last week, I was obsessively pinning images of sleek, minimalist home offices – all natural light and built-in bookshelves. Just a quiet, organized space to *think*. Then, out of the blue, my partner surprised me with… a custom-built standing desk with integrated shelving. Exactly like the images. 

I was stunned. Not thrilled. A strange, prickly feeling. It felt like someone had plucked a dream right out of my head. Like an algorithm, analyzing my Pinterest board, had anticipated a need *I* hadn't fully articulated.  It was thoughtful, sure, but also… unsettling. Maybe we're all slowly becoming projections of our digital footprints.
