**The Ghosts in the Machine (and How I Finally Got Rid of Them)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How sometimes the most frustrating tech problems aren’t about grand, complicated outages. They’re about… well, ghosts. Digital ghosts, specifically. 

I was wrestling with a Horizon environment last year, 2021 to be exact, and it felt like I was chasing shadows. We were getting provisioning errors – VMs just wouldn’t launch – and the logs pointed to a single, maddening culprit: a ballooning number of vmdk files.  

At first, I was just frantically adding more storage, assuming it was a simple capacity issue. But it quickly became clear that we were hoarding *orphaned* files – remnants of old applications, test environments, you name it. It was like a digital attic, overflowing with forgotten things. 

It took a while to realize the real problem wasn’t *lack* of space, but a massive *accumulation* of it.  Deleting those stray vmdk files – painstakingly combing through the storage – was surprisingly therapeutic.  It felt like clearing out mental clutter, too. 

That experience really hammered home the idea that sometimes, the most efficient solution isn’t always the most obvious.  It’s about understanding the *why* behind the problem, not just slapping a band-aid on the symptom.
