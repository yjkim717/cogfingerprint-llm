## The Desktop That Mocked Me (and Windows 10)

Ugh, anyone else ever feel like their computer is *actively* fighting them? I spent a frustrating hour this week staring at a Windows 10 desktop full of blank icons. Deleting the iconcache file? Done. Still blank. It’s a weirdly unsettling feeling, right? Like your digital world just… vanished. Makes you appreciate the little things, like a properly displayed shortcut! Hoping it’s just a temporary glitch. 



Hope this fits what you were looking for! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
