It’s 2021, and I’m standing at a crossroads. My undergrad in neuroscience was fascinating, but I’ve realized I want to build the future, not just study it. That’s why I’m eyeing a master’s with a heavy engineering focus. I dream of merging biology with tech, diving into computational neuroscience or neuroengineering for my PhD. It’s daunting, but the chance to decode the brain with code and circuits? That’s a frontier I can’t wait to explore.
