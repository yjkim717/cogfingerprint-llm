"Stepping Back from the Screen: A Reflection on Online Entrepreneurship in 2021

As I sat down to update my Constantiam shop's sales and donation records, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. It's been a while since I've shared a progress update, and I'm finally ready to face the numbers. My online shop, a labor of love, has been a journey of self-discovery and experimentation. With a total donation of $73.05 to PhantomCaptain/Constantiam.net, I'm reminded that even small steps can lead to meaningful outcomes. Running an online business has taught me the importance of transparency and accountability. As I reflect on the past year, I'm grateful for the lessons learned and the community that's supported me. As I move forward, I'm excited to continue sharing my journey and exploring the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship."
