**The Algorithm Almost Broke Me**

Okay, 2021 was… a year. I was laser-focused on getting into Computer Science – practically living and breathing coding. My SAT score was decent, and I’d meticulously crafted a plan to maintain a perfect GPA. Then, everything started to unravel. My grades slipped, and suddenly, my GPA dropped noticeably. 

It was a brutal wake-up call. I realized I’d been so obsessed with *appearing* successful, with hitting those metrics, that I’d completely neglected actually *understanding* the material. The pressure felt like an algorithm – constantly demanding more, pushing me further until I felt like I was about to crash. It taught me a hard lesson: chasing numbers isn’t the same as genuine learning.  Now, I’m prioritizing a sustainable approach, and honestly, it feels a lot better.
