Okay, here’s a blog post draft inspired by the Ellison summary, set in 2021 and aiming for a conversational, reflective tone:

**Lost in the Algorithm: Feeling Invisible Again?**

I just finished re-reading Ralph Ellison’s *Invisible Man* – seriously, it hit me hard. It’s unsettling how relevant his story still feels, even now, in 2021.  I've been spending so much time online lately, scrolling, reacting, feeling… unseen. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re hyper-connected, yet sometimes it feels like we’re utterly invisible. Like we’re just data points in some massive algorithm, judged by likes and comments.  Like Ellison’s narrator, I’m grappling with this feeling of not truly *being seen* for who I am. 

Maybe it’s time to actively seek out connection beyond the screen, to build a digital *brotherhood* – a space where authenticity matters more than engagement.  It’s a frustrating thought, but perhaps finding our voice offline is the first step to becoming visible again.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
