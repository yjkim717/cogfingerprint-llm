The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill, and the UK is no exception. As I scrolled through YouTube comments on COVID-19 news updates in 2021, I was taken aback by the sheer volume of antivaxxer sentiment. It was as if the pandemic had become a breeding ground for misinformation, with social media platforms like YouTube unwittingly facilitating its spread.

I couldn't help but feel a sense of concern and dismay at the prevalence of anti-vaccine views. How could so many people be misinformed about the safety and efficacy of vaccines? It was clear that social media had become a double-edged sword - while it had connected people across the globe, it had also created an environment where misinformation could thrive.

As I delved deeper into the comments section, I realized that the issue wasn't just about vaccines or COVID-19; it was about the way we consume information online. We're often guilty of echoing our own views and reinforcing our existing biases, rather than engaging with opposing perspectives. This creates an "us versus them" mentality, where people become entrenched in their views and are less likely to consider alternative facts.

The pandemic has highlighted the need for critical thinking and media literacy in the digital age. As we navigate the complexities of online information, it's more important than ever to be discerning and to seek out credible sources. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more informed and nuanced online discourse, one that prioritizes fact-based information over misinformation and conspiracy theories.
