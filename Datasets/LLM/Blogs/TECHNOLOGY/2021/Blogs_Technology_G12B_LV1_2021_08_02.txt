>## The Algorithm and the Ambiguity of 'Future Plans'

Okay, so I’m sitting here in London, sipping a lukewarm cup of tea and staring out at the rain. It’s a far cry from my sunny Californian life, but I’m trying to soak it all in during this tourist visa trip. And, naturally, my brain has wandered to work.

I’ve been chatting with a few recruiters here - purely exploratory, you know? Just seeing what the scene looks like. But a nagging question keeps popping up: are these conversations, these tentative steps towards a potential job, going to mess with my chances of a future visa? Specifically, the Skilled Worker visa, or even potentially the Shortage Occupation list.

It’s frustrating, honestly. The UK needs software engineers (apparently!), but navigating the immigration system feels like trying to predict the next Google algorithm update. You're always trying to anticipate the unforeseen consequence. It’s made me think a lot about how we plan – about how much of our future is truly in our hands, and how much is dictated by bureaucratic processes and, let's be honest, a bit of luck.



Hopefully, a quick chat with an immigration lawyer is in order!
