Remember those late nights in early 2021, wrestling with dummy data for Pydantic models? I’d manually type out fake emails and dates, wondering if there was a better way. Then I discovered pydantic-factories—it felt like someone had handed me a magic wand. Suddenly, generating realistic mock data became effortless, letting me focus on what truly mattered: building and refining. It’s funny how one small package can transform frustration into flow, reminding me that sometimes, the best tools simply get out of your way.
