### The Unseen Quota: A Founder's 2021 Reflection

Back in 2021, the world felt like it was running on two speeds. On one hand, we were all glued to screens, convinced that the next big tech solution was just a line of code away. My startup was my entire universe—a slick app designed to connect local artisans with a global audience. I was coding, pitching, and living the dream, or so I thought.

But the other, slower, more bureaucratic world was always there. While I was wrestling with server loads, I was also wrestling with a different kind of architecture: immigration law. As a non-EU founder in Austria, my right to stay was tied to a complex dance of quotas and permits. I’d lie awake, the glow of my laptop a nightlight, wondering if my "gainful employment excepted" settlement permit was more valuable than the newer, shinier startup founder visa. One offered stability but came with restrictions that felt antithetical to the hustle of building a company. The other celebrated innovation but felt like a high-stakes gamble on a government's definition of a "viable" idea.

It was a strange duality. My entire professional life was about breaking down digital barriers, yet my personal reality was defined by very physical ones—paperwork, quotas, and permits. It taught me that for every disruptive technology, there’s an old-world system it must learn to navigate, or be navigated by. The real innovation, I learned, wasn't just in the code, but in the patience to build a life around it.
