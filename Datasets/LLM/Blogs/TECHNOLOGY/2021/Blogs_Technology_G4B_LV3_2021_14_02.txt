**When New Features Feel Like Detours**

Remember when we got so excited about the latest updates to [mention a popular tech platform – e.g., Discord]? All those shiny new buttons and interfaces seemed like a natural evolution, right? I felt that way about the recent additions to the Ark storyline – specifically, the introduction of Victoria Walker.

Do you ever feel this way about tech updates?
