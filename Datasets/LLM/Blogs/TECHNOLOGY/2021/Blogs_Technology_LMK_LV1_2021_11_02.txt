"Throwback to the 2021 election season when a satirical candidate shook things up with a quirky presidency campaign. Their platform policies were, shall we say, vague, but the rally event they hosted was a wild ride. It was part concert, part comedy show, and part merchandise booth - who needs specifics on healthcare or education when you can sell 'I'd rather be protesting' t-shirts? I joined their Discord server out of curiosity, and it was...interesting. The community was lively, with people passionately debating the candidate's (lack of) stance on various issues. As I scrolled through the chat, I couldn't help but wonder: is this the future of politics? Are we more invested in the spectacle than the substance? As I left the server, I realized that maybe that's the point - we're living in a world where entertainment and politics are increasingly intertwined. And honestly, it's kind of terrifying."
