"Stuck in the Past: A Mac Update Saga". I still recall the frustration of trying to update my old MacBook from Yosemite to El Capitan via the App Store. In 2021, with macOS upgrades a breeze, it's hard to believe I once struggled with outdated tech. That experience taught me the value of staying current and the perils of clinging to what's familiar. Has anyone else had a similar tech growing pain?
