The London drizzle felt different today. Each raindrop seemed to whisper the same question that had been echoing in my mind since breakfast. There it was again—another LinkedIn message from a UK recruiter, the third this week, all promising "urgent roles for skilled software engineers."

My American passport got me here on a tourist visa, no questions asked. But these persistent messages about Britain's "tech shortage occupation" list create a strange tension. Part of me wants to respond, to explain that yes, I can build the cloud infrastructure they need. The other part remembers the clear restrictions: no seeking work, no matter how casually.

It's 2021—the world feels both endlessly connected and full of invisible walls. I close the laptop, watching another double-decker bus splash through puddles outside. The opportunities float so close, yet remain just beyond reach, separated by paperwork and borders in our supposedly borderless digital world.
