It’s 2021, and I’m deep into Krunker, chasing that buttery-smooth 144 FPS. I’ve tried everything: disabling the FPS cap in Brave, toggling hardware acceleration, and tweaking GPU rendering settings. Yet, the frame rate stutters like a scratched record. It’s a frustrating reminder that even with powerful tech, the perfect gaming experience can feel just out of reach. Sometimes, the digital world has a stubborn mind of its own, no matter how hard we try to tame it.
