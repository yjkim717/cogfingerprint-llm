"Swapping Routers, Finding Simplicity: My MikroTik CRS354 Journey"

As I sat in my home lab, surrounded by cables and devices, I found myself pondering the complexity of my MikroTik CRS354 setup. Running RouterOS, it had been a powerful tool, but I realized I wasn't utilizing its full potential - and that was the problem. The interface was cluttered, and I was drowning in a sea of features I didn't need. That's when I decided to make the switch to SwOS. Simplifying my setup was liberating; the stripped-down interface made configuring my network a breeze. The CRS354, once a beast, was now a streamlined workhorse. In 2021, as our reliance on technology grows, sometimes the best solution is to strip back the complexity. My home lab has never been more efficient, and I'm loving the newfound simplicity SwOS has brought to my MikroTik CRS354.
