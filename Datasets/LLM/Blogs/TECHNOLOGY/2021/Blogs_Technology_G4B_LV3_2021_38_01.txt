**The Quiet Spark: Why I’m Trading Theories for Synapses**

It’s funny, isn’t it? I spent years wrestling with Kant and Hume, chasing the perfect formulation of an argument. Philosophy was all about dissecting ideas, building castles of logic – and frankly, feeling a little lost in the process. 2021 felt like a year of realizing those castles were beautiful, but maybe not *useful* in the way I’d hoped. 

I’ve been wrestling with a big question: what truly motivates us? And lately, the answer feels less about abstract concepts and more about something deeply rooted in how our brains actually *work*. That’s why I’m seriously considering a shift – a leap from philosophy to neuroscience. 

It’s a bit daunting, I’ll admit. My background isn’t exactly overflowing with lab experience. But there’s this insistent pull, this intellectual curiosity, fueled by a desire to contribute something tangible. I want to understand the neurological basis of human connection, how we build communities, and maybe – just maybe – help people find their own sparks of motivation. 

I think there’s a quiet beauty in understanding the mechanics of the mind. It’s a different kind of exploration, one that trades philosophical debate for the tangible wonder of the brain.  And honestly, that feels like a direction worth chasing.
