>## The Ghost of My Old Laptop

It's funny the things you miss. I finally upgraded my laptop last week – a much-needed upgrade, honestly. My old one was wheezing and struggling to run anything beyond basic web browsing. But as I boxed it up, a wave of… nostalgia?… hit me.

That laptop saw me through so much. Late-night study sessions, frantic job applications, even my first tentative steps into video editing. I remember agonizing over rendering times, the fan screaming like a jet engine. It was frustrating then, but now it feels almost… comforting. 

It’s a reminder that technology isn't just about the newest specs. It's about the experiences tied to those machines. My shiny new laptop is faster, sleeker, and infinitely more capable, but it doesn't hold the same history. I almost feel like I'm saying goodbye to an old friend. Maybe I'll keep it around, a digital ghost of a simpler (and slower) time.
