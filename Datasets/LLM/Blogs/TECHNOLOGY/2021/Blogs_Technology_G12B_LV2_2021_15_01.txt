## The Algorithm Finally Understood Me?

Okay, so this is weird. For *years* Spotify's "Discover Weekly" feltâ€¦off. Then, last Friday? Bang. A playlist of exactly the obscure Icelandic post-rock I've been craving. It felt less like an algorithm and more like someone had peeked into my brain. Makes you wonder, right? Are they *really* getting smarter, or am I just finally predictable? 2021 and still grappling with the digital echo chamber.
