>## The Quiet Joy of Data Transformation: Why I'm Dabbling with Scala 3 and DTOs

Okay, let's be honest, nobody *loves* data mapping. It's the plumbing of software, the often-overlooked but absolutely essential process of getting data from point A to point B when those points have different shapes. For years, I’ve wrestled with this in Java, relying on tools like MapStruct to handle the tediousness of field name discrepancies and type conversions. It’s a lifesaver, truly, but I’ve always felt a little…verbose about it.

Then I started poking around with Scala 3. And something clicked.

Scala 3’s expressiveness, particularly its improved type system and compile-time metaprogramming capabilities, sparked an idea: could I build a more *elegant* mapping solution? Something that felt less like boilerplate and more like…code.

I'm not aiming to replace MapStruct entirely – it’s a well-established, robust tool. But I’m exploring the possibility of a smaller, more focused library leveraging Scala 3's strengths. The goal is to handle the common DTO transformation scenarios with a level of conciseness and type safety that feels… well, *Scala-esque*. 

Think about it: defining mappings as compile-time computations, ensuring type correctness *before* runtime.  It’s a chance to inject some functional programming principles into a traditionally imperative task.

It’s still early days. I’m knee-deep in experimentation, playing with macros and type classes.  It's a side project, a little passion project really. But there's a quiet joy in tackling these kinds of challenges, in striving for cleaner, more expressive code. And who knows, maybe something useful will emerge from it. Anyone else feeling the pull of elegant data transformation lately?
