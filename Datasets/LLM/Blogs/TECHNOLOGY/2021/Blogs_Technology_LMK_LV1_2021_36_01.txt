"As I scrolled through online marketplaces in 2021, I stumbled upon a treasure trove of refurbished Dell Latitude laptops at dirt-cheap prices. Companies were renewing their fleets, and these gently used machines were flooding the market. My mind began to spin with possibilities - could I use them for Monero mining? But then I thought, why not upgrade to Ryzen 7 powered laptops instead? The COVID-19 pandemic had me stuck at home, and I was itching to tinker. In the end, I decided to explore the potential of these affordable laptops and see if I could breathe new life into them."
