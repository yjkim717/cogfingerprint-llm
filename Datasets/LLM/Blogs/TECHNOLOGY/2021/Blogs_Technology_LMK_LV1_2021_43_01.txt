As I sat down to tackle my latest project in late 2021, I found myself wrestling with a familiar pain point: generating mock data for testing. That's when I stumbled upon pydantic-factories, a game-changing Python package that simplified my workflow. With the recent release of v0.6.0, I'm excited to see where this tool is headed. As someone who's relied on dataclasses and pydantic for years, I'm eager to contribute to the conversation - what features would you like to see next in pydantic-factories?
