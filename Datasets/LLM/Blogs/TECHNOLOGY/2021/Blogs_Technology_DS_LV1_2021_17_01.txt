### The Ghost in the Machine: A Regex Tale of Java 8 to 11

I’ve always believed that good code is timeless. So, when I finally upgraded our core service from Java 8 to Java 11 in late 2021, I expected a smooth ride. The build was clean, the tests passed. Victory, I thought.

Then the bug reports trickled in. Our data validation was failing for seemingly perfect inputs. I spent a whole day doubting my sanity—the regex patterns were identical! I’d copy-paste them between the old and new environments, and one would work while the other rejected the same string.

It felt like chasing a ghost. After digging through release notes, I found my culprit: subtle changes to the `java.util.regex` engine. A minor performance optimization in Java 9 had inadvertently altered how certain boundary matchers were interpreted in complex patterns. My "timeless" code was, in fact, version-dependent.

It was a humbling lesson. We don't just migrate languages; we migrate their entire ecosystems and quirks. Now, I treat major version upgrades not as a simple switch, but as a meticulous archaeological dig into the very tools we take for granted.
