Of course, here is a reflective blog post inspired by your summary.

It was late 2021, and I was doomscrolling through a global tech forum when I stumbled upon a thread that stopped me cold. A user from the US was desperately trying to sell their meticulously coded software library. Not for a fortune, but for a few hundred dollars—enough, they wrote, to make rent and avoid eviction.

My first reaction was disbelief. Here was a clearly skilled individual, a creator, resorting to a digital fire sale out of sheer desperation. In that moment, the abstract concept of economic inequality became painfully personal. It wasn't just about wage gaps; it was about the crushing pressure that forces talent into a corner.

Sitting in Copenhagen, I looked out my window at a city with a strong social safety net and wondered: would a Danish developer ever feel this level of Hail-Mary panic? We have our struggles, sure, but this felt like a different kind of societal fracture. Technology was supposed to be the great equalizer, a global platform for innovation. Yet, it was also mirroring and amplifying the deep-seated inequalities of the physical world. That post wasn't just an offer to sell code; it was a quiet, digital cry from a system failing its people, and it’s a sound that has haunted me ever since.
