It’s 2021, and honestly, I’ve been craving a little chaos—the good kind. That’s why I’ve been diving back into URF mode in my downtime. There’s something about the fast-paced, over-the-top action that feels like a digital playground.

Lately, I’ve been experimenting with Rumble, building Riftmaker and Demonic Embrace for a bruiser setup. It’s not about chasing the meta; it’s about finding that sweet spot where fun meets function. The durability and sustain let me stay in the fray longer, turning chaotic team fights into calculated, fiery engagements. In a year that often felt unpredictable, there’s a strange comfort in controlling a little mayhem, one scorching Equalizer at a time.
