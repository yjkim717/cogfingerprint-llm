**The Ghost in the Machine**

Anyone else feel like technology’s getting… glitchier? I was grinding away in *Warzone* on Rebirth Island last week, trying to dominate, when it happened again. A sudden, jarring disconnect – my host just vanished. It’s incredibly frustrating, right? Like a little ghost in the machine. 

I started wondering if I was alone in experiencing these host issues. It’s easy to feel isolated when the digital world throws you curveballs.  It’s a reminder that even the most polished games are still built on code, and sometimes, that code just needs a reboot.  Anyone else battling this lately?
