>## The Ghosts in the Machine (and My Car)

It's 2021, and we're supposed to be living in a world of seamless automation, right? Everything connected, everything tracked, everything… accurate? Lately, I’ve been questioning that rosy picture.

It started innocently enough. A minor hiccup with my car registration here in DC. Turns out, the DMV had a bit of a mix-up, assigning my information to… someone else’s car. And that car, apparently, has been racking up tickets. Lots of them. 

I'm now wading through a bureaucratic swamp, trying to prove I *don't* own a vehicle with a specific license plate. It’s frustrating beyond words. The irony isn’t lost on me – we’re obsessed with data, with algorithms that promise precision, and yet, here I am, a victim of a simple, human-caused error amplified by a system that should be infallible. 

It's a stark reminder that even the most sophisticated technology is only as good as the data it processes. And sometimes, that data is just plain wrong. Makes you wonder what other ghosts are lurking in the machine.
