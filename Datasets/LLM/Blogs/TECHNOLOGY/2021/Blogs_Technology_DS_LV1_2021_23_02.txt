Remember 2021? We were all glued to screens, and my feed became a bizarre split-screen of reality. On one side, friends in Denmark posted about their "hygge" and state-supported retraining programs. On the other, a viral thread detailed an American's desperate theft of baby formula.

It hit me then: technology isn't just connecting us; it's holding up a brutally clear mirror to societal fractures. We're no longer just comparing ourselves to our neighbors; we're comparing our entire system to others in real-time.
