## The Weight of Progress (and My Laptop Bag)

It's weird, isn't it? How much our lives have become intertwined with technology? I'm heading back to campus this fall – finally! – after a long, pandemic-shaped break, and the biggest difference isn't the return to lectures, it's the sheer *weight* of what I’m carrying. 

Not just the emotional weight of readjusting, but the literal weight. My laptop, charger, textbooks (okay, mostly e-books now, but still!), and all the other gadgets that seem essential for a Computer Science student. It got me thinking about how rapidly things have changed. Ten years ago, a spiral notebook and a pen were my main tools. Now? It’s a whole mobile workstation.

I’m actually on a mission to find a decent totepack – something sturdy enough to handle the load, comfortable on my shoulder, and, let’s be honest, doesn’t scream “stressed-out CS student.” It feels symbolic, somehow. Finding the right bag to carry the future, one line of code at a time. Anyone got recommendations? Seriously, hit me with your best bag advice!
