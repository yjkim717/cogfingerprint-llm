As I dived into the world of Linux window managers in 2021, I found myself torn between the allure of minimalism and the need for modern functionality. I had been using DWM, a lightweight tiling window manager, but its bare-bones simplicity, while efficient, left me yearning for more. I wanted a balance between the streamlined aesthetic of DWM and the user-friendly features that modern window managers offer. My search was on for a tiling WM that didn't sacrifice customization for ease of use. I experimented with various alternatives, tweaking configurations and exploring new workflows. The journey taught me that the perfect WM isn't just about managing windows â€“ it's about curating an environment that boosts productivity and complements your workflow. For those on a similar quest, I share my insights and experiences, in the hopes that you'll find the perfect blend of form and function for your Linux setup.
