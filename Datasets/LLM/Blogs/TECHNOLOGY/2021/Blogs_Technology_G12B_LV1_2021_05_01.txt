## Lost in the Algorithm, Finding My Feet

It's funny, isn't it? I moved out to the Bay Area in late 2020, lured by the promise of tech and a fresh start. I’m a software engineer, a cog in a very large machine, and honestly, sometimes I feel… disconnected. 

I spent so much time optimizing code, building interfaces, and chasing the next shiny framework, I almost forgot about the *real* world.  I'd spend my evenings staring at a screen, then walk home from BART, hyper-aware of my surroundings, a weird mix of anxiety and fascination. 

A friend, new to the area too, asked me the other day, “Do you ever feel like you’re living in a simulation?” And it hit me. We’re so immersed in digital spaces, we sometimes forget to ground ourselves.  

I started taking a self-defense class – something completely outside my usual routine. It sounds silly, but learning to stand my ground, physically and metaphorically, has been surprisingly empowering. It's a needed balance, a reminder that even in a world increasingly defined by algorithms, there's strength in knowing how to navigate the streets, and the complexities of life, with confidence.
