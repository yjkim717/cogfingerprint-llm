**The Dance Between Data: Scala 3 and Mapping Mishaps**

It’s weird how much time you spend wrestling with data, right? Back in 2021, I was knee-deep in a Scala project, trying to get my entity models – think customer details, product specs – to smoothly flow into data transfer objects.  It felt like a constant battle against mismatched field names and awkward conversions. 

I’d been using older approaches, and it was… clunky.  Then I stumbled upon Scala 3 and, specifically, MapStruct. Suddenly, the idea of mapping these models felt less like a chore and more like a graceful dance. 

Record classes in Scala 3 really simplified things. It’s amazing how a little syntactic sugar can make a huge difference. It wasn’t just about efficiency; it was about clarity.  Spending less time fighting the data and more time actually *thinking* about the business logic? That’s a win.  It reminded me that sometimes, the best technology isn’t the flashiest, but the one that just *makes* the process easier.
