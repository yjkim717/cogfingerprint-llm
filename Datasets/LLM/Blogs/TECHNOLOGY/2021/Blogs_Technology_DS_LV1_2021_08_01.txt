### The Code Compiles, But I Don't: A Search for Connection in 2021

It’s a strange feeling when the most predictable system you know is a distributed cloud architecture, and the most unpredictable is your own mind. I’ve spent two decades as a software engineer, and in that world, I speak a clear, logical language. If the code is clean, the tests pass. If the server is configured correctly, it responds. It’s a world of satisfying cause and effect.

But returning to the US last year, in the thick of a world that felt both hyper-connected and utterly isolating, that logic broke down. My career was built on remote work, a space where my Asperger's could almost be a superpower—focusing for hours on complex problems, appreciating the clarity of text-based communication. I thought I was prepared for 2021. I was wrong.

The silence in my apartment became a physical presence. The same tools that made me a great engineer—Slack, Zoom, Jira—became a cage. My social life was a series of muted video squares and delayed messages. For someone whose brain is already wired to find subtext and casual chatter exhausting, the pandemic didn’t just create isolation; it formalized it. The rules of engagement I’d painstakingly learned over 40 years were suddenly obsolete.

The depression wasn't a new bug in my system, but a legacy one that had found a major security hole to exploit. I could debug a multi-threaded race condition, but I couldn't figure out how to ask for help. How do you Google the query: "How to find a therapist who gets that you can architect a microservices platform but can't navigate the small talk before the session starts?"

My search wasn't for a miracle cure, but for compatibility. I wasn't looking for someone to "fix" my autism, but for someone who understood it as the operating system I run on, not a glitch. I needed a professional who saw that my loneliness wasn't about a lack of people, but a lack of meaningful, low-demand connection.

I’m still in the process of compiling this new patch. It’s messy. But I’m learning that the most important system I’ll ever work on isn't written in Python or Go. It’s the one that reminds me to reach out, to be specific in my needs, and to accept that some systems—especially human ones—require a different kind of logic, one based on patience and self-compassion. The terminal might not show "SUCCESS" for a long time, and that's okay. The process is the point.
