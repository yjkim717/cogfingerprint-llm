It was late 2021, and I was caught up in the Cardano hype. My Bitcoin was sitting pretty in my Exodus Wallet, so I used their built-in exchange for a quick swap. The convenience was instant, but so was the sticker shock. The fees were far steeper than I expected.

Later, I checked Binance out of curiosity. The difference was staggering. Iâ€™d paid a premium for that in-wallet simplicity. It was a tough lesson: in the fast-moving crypto world, a moment of convenience can cost you. Now, I always double-check where I trade.
