## Remembering the Duck: Typing and the Joy of JavaScript

It's 2021, and I'm still finding joy in the flexibility of JavaScript. Lately, I've been diving into duck typing, that wonderfully pragmatic "if it walks like a duck..." idea. TypeScript’s approach to this, letting you define types loosely, is surprisingly neat! It reminds me of a Monty Python sketch – embracing the absurd while still getting things done. Sometimes, the most elegant solutions are delightfully unexpected.
