"As I traversed Canada in 2021, I couldn't help but notice the vast digital divide between Ontario's bustling cities and quaint small towns. In the cities, high-speed internet and 5G connectivity were the norms. However, in the smaller towns, connectivity was patchy at best. This experience made me reflect on the role technology plays in bridging geographical gaps. It's 2021, and while technology has connected the world, there's still much work to be done to ensure equal access to the digital world, especially in rural areas."
