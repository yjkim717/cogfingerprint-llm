It’s 2021, and I’m still amazed at how a simple software update can feel like a fresh start. Last week, my phone’s new OS had me reorganizing apps I’d ignored for years—suddenly, everything felt lighter, more intentional. It reminded me that in tech, as in life, we often carry digital clutter without realizing it. Sometimes, all it takes is a gentle nudge from an update to rediscover what truly matters and streamline our virtual world.
