"Lost in the DMV Digital Maze"

I still can't believe the wild goose chase I went on in 2021 trying to clear my name with the DMV. It started with a string of tickets for a car I didn't own. Turns out, someone had registered their vehicle with my license plate number - a classic case of identity mix-up. As I navigated the online portal, I was frustrated by the lack of transparency and outdated tech. Phone calls and emails only led to more dead ends. It took months to resolve the issue, leaving me to wonder: are our DMV systems equipped to handle the digital age?
