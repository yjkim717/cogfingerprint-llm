As I dove back into Baldur's Gate 3 in the summer of 2021, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and frustration. Larian's ambitious D&D adaptation had me hooked, but I found myself stumbling over the complex mechanics. I longed for in-game tutorials to guide me through the intricacies of proficiency and spellcasting. It struck me that a gentle nudge from the game itself could make all the difference. I wasn't alone in my struggles, and as I scrolled through forums, I discovered others echoing my sentiments. Some also pointed out the need for a streamlined bug reporting process - a pet peeve that's only grown more irksome with time. As I pondered these pain points, I realized that a more intuitive, user-friendly experience would elevate the entire gaming experience. Here's hoping Larian takes note, and future updates bring the game even closer to perfection.
