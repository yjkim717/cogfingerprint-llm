>## The Algorithm Didn't See Me, Just a Keyword Match

It’s 2021, and I’m still wrestling with the strange disconnect between technology’s promise of efficiency and the reality of… well, feeling utterly disregarded. I recently went through a lengthy application process for a role that seemed perfect. The online portal devoured my resume, meticulously parsing keywords like “project management” and “data analysis.” I felt optimistic - a digital handshake, a sign I was a good fit.

Then came the interview. A Zoom call with someone who clearly hadn't even glanced at my CV. The questions were generic, the conversation stilted, and the closing felt… abrupt. "We’ll be in touch," they said, a phrase that's become synonymous with "don't call us, we'll call you."

It’s frustrating, isn't it? We pour hours into crafting our digital profiles, hoping to be seen beyond the algorithm. Yet, sometimes, it feels like we're just a collection of keywords, judged and discarded with a casual click. I'm left wondering if technology is truly connecting us, or just streamlining the process of rejection.
