## That Lingering Feeling: Tech, Visas, and the Fear of Overstaying Welcome

It's 2021, and the world feels… precarious. Especially when you’re a software engineer navigating international work visas. I recently had a weird experience that’s been bouncing around in my head. I was visiting the UK as a tourist, soaking up the culture and enjoying a break. But, naturally, recruiters started reaching out. 

Now, I know responding to messages isn’t *technically* a violation, but a past run-in with border control left me with a knot of anxiety. The thought of inadvertently crossing a line, of being seen as someone seeking work while on a tourist visa, felt paralyzing. 

It made me think about the strange limbo many of us in tech find ourselves in – constantly sought after, yet often tethered to complex immigration rules. It’s a constant tightrope walk, balancing opportunity with the fear of overstaying your welcome, both professionally and legally. Anyone else feel this tension?
