hugely challenging bosses. I finally took down Midir in Dark Souls 3 last night, and it felt… surprisingly good. After a few frustrating attempts, the rhythm clicked. Suddenly, his colossal attacks weren't just chaos, but a dance I could anticipate. It’s a weird parallel to learning new software, isn't it? Initial frustration, then a gradual understanding, and finally, a satisfying flow.
