**The Unexpected Buzz**

Remember those late nights in 2021, scrolling through endless Discord servers? It felt like everyone was plugged in, arguing about *everything*.  I was bouncing between local politics threads and trying to make sense of this new wave of candidates promising radical change – a lot of it fueled by online communities. 

It was… chaotic.  There was this incredible energy, a feeling that people genuinely believed they could shape things.  I saw a local candidate announce their presidential run, really leaning into a “self-directed” platform, and the response was immediate – a planned rally suddenly packed with supporters. 

It made me think about how quickly our attention can be pulled, and how easily a single announcement can spark a wildfire of discussion.  We were so eager to be *part* of the conversation, to feel like we had a voice, that we sometimes lost sight of the actual people behind the screens.  Maybe that’s a lesson we still need to learn, even now.
