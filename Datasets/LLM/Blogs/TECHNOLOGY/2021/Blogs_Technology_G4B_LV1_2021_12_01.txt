**Lost in Translation (Again!) – My Tech-Fueled Multilingual Mess**

Okay, real talk. 2021 was… a year. Working remotely meant constant video calls, and suddenly I was switching between English, Spanish, and a smattering of German *every single day*. It wasn’t a conscious choice, more like my brain just decided to do a little linguistic gymnastics. 

I started noticing patterns - when I’d code in Python, I’d slip into more formal Spanish; a quick Slack message to a colleague in Berlin would trigger a German phrase. It felt like a mild form of ‘ln (n=>3)’ – three languages battling for dominance in my head. 

Honestly, there were moments of pure, glorious confusion. Like, I *know* the right word, but it just… doesn’t come out right.  I was desperately seeking advice online about “code-switching” – that’s what it’s called, right? It felt less like a superpower and more like a chaotic juggling act.  Anyone else feel this way navigating a globally connected world?
