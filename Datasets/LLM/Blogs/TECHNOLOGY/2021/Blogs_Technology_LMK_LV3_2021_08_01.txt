**Finding Connection in Code: My Journey with Autism and Software Engineering**

As I sit here in my home office in 2021, surrounded by screens and wires, I'm reminded of the irony of my profession. As a software engineer, I'm constantly connected to technology, yet I've often struggled to connect with people. At 40, I've come to accept that my autism is a part of who I am, but it's not always easy.

The pandemic had just hit when I made the difficult decision to move back to the US from the UK. I was excited to be back home, but the isolation was overwhelming. As someone with autism, I've always had to work harder to navigate social situations, and the pandemic made it even harder. Simple tasks like grocery shopping or meeting friends for coffee became daunting challenges. I felt like I was losing myself in the process.

But as I dove back into my work, I found solace in code. There's something about the logic and structure of programming that feels like a warm hug to me. As I worked on complex projects, I felt a sense of calm and focus that I hadn't experienced in years. The world outside was chaotic, but in my coding bubble, everything made sense.

However, the more I immersed myself in software engineering, the more I realized that I'm not alone. Many of my colleagues and online friends were struggling with their own mental health challenges, from social anxiety to depression. We'd share our stories and support each other through online forums and virtual meetups. For the first time, I felt like I was part of a community that understood me.

As I look back on the past year, I realize that my journey with autism and software engineering has been a double-edged sword. While the pandemic exacerbated my feelings of loneliness, it also led me to find connection in the most unexpected place – code. I've come to understand that my autism is not a limitation, but rather a different way of experiencing the world. And in the world of software engineering, that's not a weakness, but a strength.

In a world where technology is increasingly woven into the fabric of our lives, I'm grateful to have found a profession that not only accepts me for who I am but also allows me to thrive. As I continue on this journey, I'm excited to see where it takes me – and who I'll meet along the way.
