**The Homescreen Hunger**

It’s weird, right? How much we rely on those little icons on our Android homescreens. Lately, I’ve been feeling this… hunger for something more. I miss having a quick, dedicated way to *search* my apps, not just scroll. Like, “Where *is* that photo editor I installed last month?”  I keep hoping for a widget that just does that – a little app search bar right on my homescreen.  Anyone else feeling this frustration? #Android #widgets #appsearch 2021
