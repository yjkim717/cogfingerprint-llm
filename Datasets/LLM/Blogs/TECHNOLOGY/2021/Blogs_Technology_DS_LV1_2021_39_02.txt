Back in 2021, the DeFi space felt like a digital gold rush. I remember diving into yield farming, chasing those high ROIs on platforms like PantherSwap, only to get tripped up by sneaky fee taxes on every transaction. Staking BNB seemed safer, but even then, I was hunting for that sweet spotâ€”maximizing returns without fees eating into profits. It was a constant hustle, balancing risk and reward in a world where the rules changed overnight. Those days taught me that in tech, patience often pays more than impulse.
