In 2021, I was wrestling with a stubborn Selenium script, trying to locate that elusive first element with class 'b' after an 'important' marker. My XPath selector felt like a riddle. I stared at the code, the cursor blinking back mockingly. It was in that quiet frustration, surrounded by empty coffee cups, that I had a simple revelation: sometimes the answer isn't a more complex command, but a clearer understanding of the structure. It’s a lesson that echoes beyond the terminal—whether in code or life, finding what comes next often starts by truly seeing what's already there.
