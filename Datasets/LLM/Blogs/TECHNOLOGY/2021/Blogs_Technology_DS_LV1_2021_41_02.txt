It’s 2021, and my new CyberPowerPC sounds like a jet engine taking off. After some head-scratching, I realized the issue: the case fans were plugged into the CPU_OPT header and set to DC power, not PWM. They were stuck at full throttle. A simple reconnection and BIOS tweak later, and now it hums quietly. It’s a reminder that even in our high-tech world, sometimes the fix is just about plugging things in the right place.
