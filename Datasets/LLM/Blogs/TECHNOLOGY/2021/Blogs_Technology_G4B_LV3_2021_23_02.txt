**Scrolling Through a Divide**

It’s weird, isn’t it?  I was doom-scrolling through Twitter last week – a totally unproductive habit, I know – and I kept thinking about this article I’d read about crime rates and inequality. It got me wondering about the digital divide, too. 

We’re all connected, supposedly, but the reality feels increasingly fractured.  Here in 2021, access to opportunity – to good jobs, to reliable internet, to even basic information – is wildly uneven.  It’s a stark comparison to places like Denmark, where a stronger social safety net seems to offer a different path. 

Maybe the constant exposure to hardship and frustration online, fueled by inequality, contributes to a different kind of ‘desperation’ than we see in traditional crime.  It’s a thought that’s been sticking with me – are we building a world where connection breeds division?
