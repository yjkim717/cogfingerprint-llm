**The Headaches of Headless Rendering (and Why I Almost Gave Up)**

Okay, confession time. Late 2021, I was wrestling with something deeply frustrating in a Next.js project – specifically, the ‘head’ element. You know, the `<head>` tag that holds the metadata for your website – title, description, viewport settings. It just… wasn’t rendering correctly on the server. 

I’d spent hours poring over documentation, convinced it was a simple configuration error. The weird part? This was happening in a completely separate project, a clean slate. It felt like a ghost in the machine. I was bouncing between `getInitialProps`, trying to force SSR, and even experimenting with client-side rendering – a total no-go for SEO, of course. 

Honestly, I was starting to question my entire Next.js skillset. It’s easy to get lost in the nuances of server-side rendering (SSR) versus static site generation (SSG) versus client-side rendering. 

Eventually, after a frustrating late-night debugging session, I realized the issue wasn't with Next.js itself, but a subtle conflict with a third-party library. It was a tiny detail, easily overlooked.  It taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, the most complex problems have the simplest solutions. And to always, *always* double-check your dependencies!
