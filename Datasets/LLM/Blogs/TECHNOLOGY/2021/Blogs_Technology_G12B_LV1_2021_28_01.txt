## The Algorithm of Self-Doubt (and How I’m Trying to Debug It)

Okay, real talk. I’ve been staring at my laptop screen for a solid hour, and all I’ve managed to produce is a rapidly growing pile of browser tabs. I’m supposed to be working on a new AI-powered project – something to help students navigate college applications, ironically – but I’m feeling…stuck.

It started with a wave of anxiety. I’m a Computer Science student, and this semester has been, let’s just say, a challenge. Things slipped. Projects piled up. My GPA took a hit. It's a little embarrassing to admit, especially when I used to brag about my perfect scores. Suddenly, I felt like a buggy piece of code, malfunctioning where I used to run flawlessly.

The weird thing is, all this tech we’re building – these algorithms meant to optimize everything – seems to have amplified the pressure. It’s like we’re constantly being assessed, measured, and ranked. Your SAT scores, your GPA, your GitHub contributions…it all feeds into some invisible algorithm determining your worth.

And right now, mine's throwing errors.

I’m trying to remember that progress isn't linear. That debugging a program – or yourself – takes time. It’s about identifying the root cause, isolating the problem, and iteratively improving. Maybe this semester was a crucial learning opportunity, a chance to build resilience, to understand that even the best code needs patching.

So, back to the project. Maybe helping others navigate the college application process will help me sort out my own. Wish me luck – I’ll need it.
