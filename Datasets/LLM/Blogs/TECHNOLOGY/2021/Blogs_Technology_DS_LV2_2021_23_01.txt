Of course, here is a reflective blog post from the perspective of 2021.

### The Unlikely Upgrade

It’s funny, isn’t it? The things that end up changing us. In 2021, my most significant technological upgrade wasn’t a new phone or a faster laptop. It was a simple, often-maligned, little rectangle: the QR code.

I remember rolling my eyes at them pre-pandemic. They felt like a clunky, unnecessary step. But then, the world shifted. Suddenly, that little black and white square became a tiny key. It was the key to a restaurant menu, saving me from touching a well-laminated card handled by hundreds. It was the key to checking into a train, avoiding a crowded ticket line. It was the key to a museum exhibit, offering a deeper dive without a crowded audio guide kiosk.

This unassuming piece of tech, which I’d dismissed as a gimmick, quietly re-wired my habits. It taught me a lesson in humility and adaptation. I stopped seeing it as a barrier and started seeing it as a bridge—a frictionless bridge to the experiences I still craved in a distanced world.

It makes me wonder what other technologies I’m underestimating today. What current “gimmick” will become the indispensable, quiet hero of my 2025? The future, it seems, doesn’t always arrive with a bang. Sometimes, it just scans quietly into place.
