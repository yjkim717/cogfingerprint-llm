"Stuck in a Digital Loop: When DMV Tech Fails"

In 2021, I learned the hard way that even the most advanced tech can fail spectacularly. After surrendering my license plates, I expected a clean slate. Instead, I started receiving tickets for a car I'd never owned. It turned out the DMV's system had associated my info with the wrong vehicle. The ensuing identity mix-up was a bureaucratic nightmare. As I navigated the red tape, I realized that our reliance on technology can sometimes create more problems than it solves. Has anyone else been caught in a similar digital loop?
