It’s 2021, and my screen time report is a blinking monument to my procrastination. I’d stare at a project file, my mind already framing it as an insurmountable digital mountain. The dread was visceral. After finally slogging through, instead of relief, I’d feel a wave of self-deprecation: "Why did that take so long? You’re so inefficient."

It was a draining loop of avoidance and guilt. I knew I needed a mental system reboot, something beyond just closing tabs. I started small, borrowing from stoic exercises I’d read about. Before opening my laptop, I’d spend two minutes in a sort of meditative practice, not to empty my mind, but to reframe it. I’d ask, "Is this task truly a monster, or have I just perspectivized it that way?"

This tiny shift didn’t make the work easier, but it changed my relationship to the starting line. The mountain became a hill, one deliberate click at a time.
