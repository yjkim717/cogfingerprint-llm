**The Angle Problem**

Okay, so 2021 was *the* year for competitive Overwatch, right? I was obsessed with trying to climb the ranks in Matchmaking mode, but something felt…off. I could *track* enemy movements like a hawk – pinpointing their every step with the game’s tools. Yet, holding angles consistently? Forget about it! It was like my aim would just drift. 

I started using Faceit for practice, and suddenly, holding angles felt natural. It’s weird, isn’t it? The tech was there, but my muscle memory just wasn't clicking with the MM environment.  MGE was promising, but it wasn't the fix.  It really highlighted how frustrating it is when the tools aren't quite syncing with your instincts.
