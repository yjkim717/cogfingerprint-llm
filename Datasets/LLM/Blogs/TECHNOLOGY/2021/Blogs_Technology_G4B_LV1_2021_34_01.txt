**Is My Tech Really Helping Me?**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Last year, I was obsessing over my new car’s tech – specifically, whether my Cadillac Escalade’s Z82 package would *actually* handle my planned camping trips.  The forums were buzzing about trailer weight and the need for a brake controller.  Suddenly, all this digital information felt…complicated. 

It made me think about how much we rely on tech to simplify our lives, but sometimes it just adds another layer of questions.  Do I *really* need that advanced navigation, or am I just worried about getting lost?  It’s a good reminder to step back and ask if the gadget is truly serving me, or just creating a new kind of stress.
