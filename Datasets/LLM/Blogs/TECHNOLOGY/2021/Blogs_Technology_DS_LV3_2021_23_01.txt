It was late 2021, and I was staring at a spreadsheet, the glow of my laptop the only light in my Berlin apartment. My tech startup, run remotely with a team spanning three time zones, was finally gaining traction. The numbers were good. But a single, non-digital problem loomed: my visa.

I felt like a digital ghost—my business existed in the cloud, but my right to stay in Europe was stubbornly terrestrial. My search led me down a rabbit hole of Austrian immigration law. The promise of a "settlement permit" felt like a golden ticket, but the reality was a maze of legalese. The "quota" system seemed like a cruel lottery, and I was just another non-EU applicant in a very long line.

Then I found it: the "gainful employment excepted" category. It sounded almost too good to be true. Could my startup's profits, earned from clients abroad, truly be my ticket in, bypassing the need for a local employer? I compared it endlessly to the dedicated startup founders visa, weighing the freedom of one against the structure of the other.

It’s a strange feeling when your future hinges on interpreting bureaucratic nuances. My entire life—code, clients, revenue—was built on logic and systems. Yet here I was, hoping that my digital livelihood would be deemed "excepted" by a very analog world. The journey was just beginning.
