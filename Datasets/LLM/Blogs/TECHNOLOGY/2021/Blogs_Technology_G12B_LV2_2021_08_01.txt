## The Algorithm of Longing: Code, Connection, and Feeling Lost in the Digital Noise

It's 2021, and the world feels… complicated. Everything’s mediated through a screen. We order groceries, meet friends (sometimes), even *work* through screens. It's amazing, isn't it? But it’s also… a lot.

I’m learning to code. Seriously. Me. Someone who always considered themselves more of a words person, a feeler, a generally awkward-in-social-situations person. I'm diving headfirst into Python, Javascript, the whole shebang. Why? Well, the plan is to eventually move back to the UK. A fresh start, a chance to build something, a little bit of stability.  It feels… necessary.

But lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the parallels between writing code and navigating the human world.  Both require logic, structure, and a relentless debugging process. In code, you fix errors. In life… well, you try to learn from them, right? 

The loneliness has been hitting me hard. It’s a familiar ache, honestly. Always has been.  I’m an aspie, diagnosed later in life, and it’s given me a framework for understanding so much of my past – the social missteps, the intense focus, the overwhelming need for routine.  It’s helped, truly. But it doesn't magically erase the feeling of being… slightly out of sync.

And the fear of change? Don't even get me started.  Moving countries is a *massive* change. Learning a new skill is a constant, low-level anxiety.  It’s like trying to build a bridge while standing on shifting sand.

What’s strange is how technology – the very thing I'm using to *build* my future – can also amplify the feeling of isolation. I scroll through social media, seeing curated versions of other people’s lives, feeling a pang of… something. Is it envy? Longing? A deep-seated desire to be part of something, *anything*, that feels genuinely connected?

I keep coming back to the idea that maybe, just maybe, learning to code isn’t just about learning a skill. Maybe it’s about learning to build systems – not just digital ones, but systems for connection, for resilience, for navigating a world that often feels chaotic and overwhelming. 

It's a slow process. There are days when the code just won't cooperate, when the loneliness feels crushing, when the fear wins. But then there are those moments, those little breakthroughs, when a line of code finally clicks, when a virtual world starts to take shape. And in those moments, I feel a flicker of hope. A sense that maybe, just maybe, I can build something worthwhile. Something that feels… like home.
