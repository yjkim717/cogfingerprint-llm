"As I built my CyberPowerPC rig in 2021, I encountered a puzzling issue - the case fans connected to the CPU_OPT header ran constantly, despite being PWM-compatible. After some digging, I discovered that the header was set to DC power by default. A simple BIOS tweak resolved the issue, allowing my fans to spin in sync with my CPU's temperature. A valuable lesson in the importance of understanding my PC's nuances."
