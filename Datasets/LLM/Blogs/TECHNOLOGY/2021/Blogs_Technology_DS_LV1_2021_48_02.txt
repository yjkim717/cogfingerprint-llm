### The Unpredictable Engine: A Lesson from the Digital Frontlines

It’s 2021, and my phone has become a stock ticker, a town square, and a revolution hub, all wrapped in one glowing rectangle. Like so many others, I got swept up in the GameStop saga. It wasn't just about money; it was a story. The little guy versus the giant, playing out in real-time on forums I’d never heard of a month before.

The energy was—and still is—incredible. We had memes as battle flags and diamond-hand emojis as our pledge of allegiance. But in that digital roar, another, more dangerous current emerged: the cult of the price target.

I’d scroll through posts where people, with absolute certainty, threw out numbers that felt less like predictions and more like prayers. "$100,000 is not a meme!" "The MOASS (Mother of All Short Squeezes) will land us on Mars!" At first, it was exhilarating. Then, it became unnerving.

Here’s the thing technology taught me through this whole experience: the internet is an incredible amplifier, but it’s a terrible fortune teller. Our digital tools—the instant messaging, the live streams, the collaborative docs tracking every DTCC rule—gave us unprecedented power to organize. But they also created an echo chamber where hype could morph into perceived fact overnight.

I’m still in the fight. I believe in the fundamental premise that sparked this. But I’ve had to consciously step back from the noise. The most valuable lesson hasn’t been about finance; it’s been about information hygiene. The same networks that connect us and empower us can also drown out reason with a tidal wave of confirmation bias.

Nobody, no matter how many upvotes they have, knows the exact outcome. The real technological marvel isn't a guaranteed payday; it's this messy, unpredictable, and utterly fascinating new power structure we’re all building together. The outcome is unknown, but the fact that we’re here, having this conversation on a global scale, is already a win. The rest? We’ll have to wait and see.
