"I recently built my dream PC with CyberPowerPC, but soon encountered a frustrating issue - my case fans were running at full speed all the time. I discovered that connecting them to the CPU_OPT header should have allowed PWM control, but it didn't. After some trial and error, I resolved the issue. For those struggling with similar fan problems, I'm sharing my experience to help you troubleshoot and optimize your PC's performance."
