As a tech worker navigating the vibrant yet unpredictable landscape of the SF Bay Area in 2021, I found myself pondering a pressing question: how safe am I, really? Coming from abroad, the cultural and societal nuances were still unfamiliar, making me acutely aware of my surroundings, especially when using public transport or walking alone. The anxiety wasn't just about crime statistics; it was about being perceived as different. I wondered if my appearance or accent made me a target for harassment or worse. Self-defence classes became a consideration, not out of paranoia, but out of a desire to feel empowered. As I looked around at the diversity that defines the Bay Area, I realized that safety isn't just about personal vigilance; it's also about community awareness and support. This reflection led me to a broader question: how can technology be harnessed to enhance safety for everyone, regardless of their background or appearance?
