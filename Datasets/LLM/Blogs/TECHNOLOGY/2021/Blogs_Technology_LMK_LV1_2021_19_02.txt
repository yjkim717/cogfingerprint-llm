"Can My App Handle More Features Than I Planned For?"

As I was building my latest mobile app in 2021, I stumbled upon a familiar dilemma. I was designing the user interface and realized that I was limited by the initial framework I had chosen. I wondered, can my app handle more features than I initially planned for? Is it like a spellcasting system, where I'm restricted by the "spell slots" I allocated at the beginning?

Just like a Lore Bard in D&D, who is bound by the number of spells they can know, I felt constrained by my app's architecture. But, as I dug deeper, I discovered that with the right design and flexibility, my app could indeed accommodate more features than I initially thought. It's a valuable lesson for developers: just as a Bard can improvise and adapt, so too can a well-designed app evolve to meet new demands. By embracing flexibility, I was able to breathe new life into my project.
