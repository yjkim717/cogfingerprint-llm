As a YouTube Premium user, I've often wondered: does the video quality I choose for offline viewing affect the audio quality too? After some digging, I discovered that the answer is no - the audio quality remains consistent, regardless of the video quality selected for download. This means I can enjoy my favorite videos with crisp audio, even when I'm on the go, without sacrificing sound for a lower video resolution.
