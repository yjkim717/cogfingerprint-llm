## The Endless Scroll and the Quiet Voice of "Good Enough"

It's 2021, and I feel like I've spent a significant portion of my year staring at a screen. Not working, not learning… just *scrolling*. Instagram, Twitter, Reddit – the usual suspects. And with each endless scroll, a little voice whispers, "You *should* be doing something more productive. You *should* be writing that novel, learning that language, finally organizing your photos."

That voice, I've realized, is a master of self-deprecation, fueled by the curated perfection I see online. Suddenly, folding laundry feels like a monumental failure compared to someone’s perfectly styled flat lay. It’s a ridiculous comparison, I know, but the feeling is real.

Lately, I've been trying to combat it. It started with just noticing the thought – that nagging “should.” Then, consciously reminding myself that *done* is better than perfect. Borrowing a bit of Stoic wisdom, I’m trying to focus on what I *can* control: showing up, putting in the effort, and accepting that sometimes, “good enough” genuinely *is* enough.  A few minutes of mindful breathing when the overwhelm hits helps too. 

It's a work in progress, for sure. But silencing the relentless comparison and embracing a little self-compassion?  That feels like a win, even if it’s just a small one, amidst the digital noise.
