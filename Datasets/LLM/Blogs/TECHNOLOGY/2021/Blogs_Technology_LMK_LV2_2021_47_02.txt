As I sat at my desk, staring at the endless stream of tickets flooding my inbox, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. As a T1 Analyst in a smaller organization, I was used to wearing multiple hats, but the lack of team support was starting to take its toll. The constant pressure to resolve complex IT issues on my own was suffocating. I worried that I wasn't equipped to handle the weight of responsibility, and the fear of not being able to keep up was palpable. Career anxiety crept in, making me question my ability to make a successful transition into more senior roles. Was I just a glorified IT support specialist, or was I a problem-solver, ready to take on the challenges of the ever-evolving tech landscape?
