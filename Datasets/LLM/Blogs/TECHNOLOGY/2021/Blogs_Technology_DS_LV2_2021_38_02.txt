That first time I held a neural implant prototype in 2021, its cool metal felt like holding a question. Could a device truly bridge the gap between silicon and the brain's wet, messy biology? It was a year of profound curiosity, where the line between human and machine blurred daily in labs. I realized then that the future isn't just about building smarter tech, but about understanding the very consciousness it might one day augment. The real engineering challenge was, and is, ourselves.
