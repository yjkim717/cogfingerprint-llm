## The Scoreboard Isn't Everything, Is It?

Anyone else feel a littleâ€¦deflated sometimes by online spaces? Lately, I've been thinking a lot about how we measure success. Whether it's chasing likes on Instagram or racking up kills in a mobile game (Guns of Boom, anyone? Seriously, some people *only* frag!), it feels like the scoreboard often dictates everything. 

But what about the fun? The collaboration? That satisfying feeling of actually *building* something, or working together to achieve a goal? Maybe 2021 is the year I focus less on the numbers and more on the experience itself. What do you think?
