**Mapping Elegance: Bringing Scala 3 to the Rescue**

As I sat sipping my coffee in early 2021, I found myself pondering the intricacies of mapping Entity Models to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) in our REST services. This isn't a new problem; Java developers have been relying on libraries like MapStruct to simplify this tedious task for years. But, as a Scala enthusiast, I wondered: could Scala 3 bring a more elegant solution to the table?

In our project, we were working with a complex domain model, and manually mapping entities to DTOs was becoming a maintenance nightmare. I began exploring Scala 3's features, hoping to find a more idiomatic way to handle this mapping. With its improved type system and concise syntax, Scala 3 seemed like the perfect candidate to simplify our mapping woes.

As I dug deeper, I discovered that Scala 3's type classes and givens could be leveraged to create a robust and flexible mapping mechanism. By defining a simple type class for mapping, we could derive instances for our entity and DTO types, eliminating the need for boilerplate code. The result was a concise, readable, and maintainable mapping solution that left our Java counterparts (and their MapStruct dependencies) in the dust.

Embracing Scala 3's expressive power allowed us to write more elegant, composable code. Our REST services became easier to understand and maintain, with a clear separation of concerns between entity models and DTOs. As I looked back on our journey, I realized that sometimes, the right language choice can be a game-changer â€“ and Scala 3 had truly delivered.
