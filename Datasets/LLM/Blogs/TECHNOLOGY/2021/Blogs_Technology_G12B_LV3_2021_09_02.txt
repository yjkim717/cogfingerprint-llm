## The Invisible Wall of Online Frustration

Anyone else ever feel like they’re banging their head against a digital wall? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with it in *Guns of Boom*. It's a fun game, but so often, the teamwork just… vanishes. Everyone’s chasing kills, racking up a personal score, while the objective sits undefended. 

It's incredibly frustrating when you're trying to coordinate a capture in Zone Control, and you're the only one actually *doing* it! It highlights something bigger, doesn't it? How easily online spaces can devolve into individual pursuits, even when cooperation is key. Makes you wonder if we’ve forgotten how to truly play *together* online.
