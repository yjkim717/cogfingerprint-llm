## The Algorithm and the Objective

It's funny how frustrations bleed across platforms. Lately, I’ve been diving back into some online multiplayer games – KotH and Zone Control, specifically. And the same old annoyance keeps popping up: teammates who seem utterly oblivious to the *point* of the game. They’ll wander off, leaving me to solo capture objectives while they snipe from a distance.

It got me thinking about algorithms. Aren't we all, in a way, optimizing for our individual goals, even within a system designed for collective effort? Social media feeds, recommendation engines – they prioritize what *you* click, not necessarily what benefits the group. Maybe that's why it feels so jarring to see a digital team fail to coordinate. We’re all chasing our own little dopamine hits, even when the objective is right there, waiting to be pushed. It’s a weird parallel, isn’t it?
