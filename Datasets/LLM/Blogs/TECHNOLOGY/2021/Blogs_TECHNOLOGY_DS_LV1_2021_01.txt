Back in 2021, as 8K displays like 7680x4320 began emerging, I found myself deep in code, wrestling with resolution conversion. It wasn’t just about dividing width by height anymore—I needed custom hex values for obscure formats. That journey reminded me how tech constantly pushes us beyond simple solutions into nuanced problem-solving. It’s in these intricate challenges that we truly grow, adapting our skills to decode the next digital frontier, one pixel at a time.
