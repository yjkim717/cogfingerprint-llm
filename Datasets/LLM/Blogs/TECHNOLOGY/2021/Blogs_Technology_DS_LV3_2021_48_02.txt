### The Screen That Held My Gaze: A Reflection on GME

It’s 3:17 AM, and the glow of my phone is the only light in the room. The chart is a jagged mountain range, and my portfolio is a tiny ship sailing its peaks and valleys. I’m a GME investor. In 2021, that statement became less of a financial classification and more of an identity. It was a digital campfire around which millions of us, retail investors, gathered, sharing memes, theories, and a stubborn, collective resolve.

We weren’t just holding shares; we were holding a belief. A belief that the playing field could be leveled, that the little guy could have a say. The energy was intoxicating, a constant buzz of "we're in this together." But as the weeks turned into months, that unity began to show a different side. The chat rooms, once filled with cautious optimism, became echo chambers of astronomical **price targets**. Numbers were thrown around that felt less like analysis and more like a fantasy sports draft. I’d see them and feel a pang of unease. Was I not committed enough if I didn’t believe we’d reach some mythical, five-figure share price?

That’s when I had to step back. I realized the most insidious form of **market manipulation** wasn’t always coming from the top down; it could bubble up from within our own ranks. The pressure to conform to the **hive-mind** was immense. To question a wildly bullish prediction was to risk being labeled a "shill." But my portfolio isn't a group project. It’s my future.

So, I’ve had to redefine my **holding strategy**. For me, it’s no longer just about diamond hands and waiting for a moonshot. It’s about mental fortitude. It’s about trusting my own **personal judgment** over the loudest voice in the forum. I still believe in the initial thesis—that the company has potential and that what happened in January was a historic moment. But I’ve divorced my emotional well-being from the hourly price swings and the hype cycles.

I’m still holding. But now, I’m holding for my own reasons, with my own exit strategy. The screen still glows, but it doesn’t hold me captive anymore. I’ve learned that in this new world of digital finance, the most important stock you can invest in is your own peace of mind. And that’s a position I plan to keep forever.
