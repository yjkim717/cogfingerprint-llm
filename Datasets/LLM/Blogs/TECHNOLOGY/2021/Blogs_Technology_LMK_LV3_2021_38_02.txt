"As I prep for my MS in neuroscience, I'm realizing that the field is becoming increasingly tech-driven. To future-proof my PhD aspirations in neuroengineering or computational neuroscience, I'm taking CS and engineering electives. It's exciting to blend disciplines and unlock new research possibilities. By embracing this interdisciplinary approach, I'm not only expanding my skillset but also opening doors to innovative applications that could revolutionize our understanding of the brain."
