**What If Our Digital Selves Were Different?**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much of our identities we project online? Lately, I’ve been tinkering with this thought – what if the algorithms that shape our digital experiences subtly shifted our perspectives, even our *selves*? 

Like that Reddit post about Mortal Kombat and gender swaps. It’s a wild fan theory, but it gets at something real.  What if the data we consume, the profiles we follow, slowly nudged us to see ourselves, and others, through a different lens? 

It’s a little unsettling to consider.  Maybe 2021 is forcing us to confront how much of our online persona is a carefully constructed version, and how much is genuinely *us*.
