**Pixel Dreams & Shifting Faces**

Okay, so I’ve been spending *way* too much time lately lost in the internet rabbit hole, and it led me to this really interesting Reddit thread. It was all about Mortal Kombat – specifically, this wild fan theory about inverting the sexualities of the characters. Seriously, imagining Sonya Blade as a brooding, quiet fighter, or Scorpion with a softer edge... it’s a surprisingly compelling thought experiment. 

It got me thinking about how technology – and especially the internet – allows us to play with identity in such radical ways. We can build these alternate versions of things we love, bending and reshaping them to fit our imaginations. It’s a little unsettling, maybe, but also incredibly liberating. Makes you wonder what other hidden facets we’re only just beginning to uncover, right?
