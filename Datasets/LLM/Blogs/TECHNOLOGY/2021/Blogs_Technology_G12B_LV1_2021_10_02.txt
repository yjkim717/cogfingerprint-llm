>## The Unexpected Beauty of Disconnecting (Even on a Road Trip)

This year, I finally took the plunge – a cross-Canada road trip. Leaving New Brunswick, the goal was simple: see the country, soak it in. I’d meticulously planned the route, highlighting charming Ontario cities and quirky small towns along the way. But I also did something else, something I hadn't planned: I drastically limited my phone use.

Initially, it felt *weird*. No constant Instagram updates, no frantic Google searches for the "best coffee shop," no endless scrolling. Instead, I found myself actually *looking* at the fields of sunflowers blazing gold in Northern Ontario, chatting with locals in tiny, blink-and-you’ll-miss-them towns, and genuinely enjoying the quiet hum of the open road. 

It’s 2021, and we’re all tethered to our devices. This trip reminded me that sometimes, the most beautiful discoveries happen when you disconnect. The unexpected detour, the friendly face, the feeling of truly being present - those are the moments you can't find in a hashtag.
