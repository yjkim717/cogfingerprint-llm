Remember those late 2021 video calls, endlessly waiting for someone’s Wi-Fi to stabilize? It felt like consulting a digital Magic 8-Ball: “Will the connection hold? Signs point to yes.” My screen would freeze, a glitchy chronurgy wizard skipping seconds of conversation. I started to see these moments not as failures, but as tiny, forced pauses—a stars druid’s reminder to look up from the screen and just breathe. The tech was flawed, but the human need for a break was perfectly clear.
