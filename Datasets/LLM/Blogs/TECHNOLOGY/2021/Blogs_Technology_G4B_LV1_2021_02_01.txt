**Controller Chaos & Retro Dreams**

Okay, so 2021 was *the* year I really dove into retro gaming on my Android. Specifically, I was obsessed with getting Dolphin working perfectly – you know, for those classic GameCube and 3DS titles. It was fantastic, until my controller started acting up. Constant disconnects and unresponsive buttons! 

It led me down a rabbit hole of forums and tutorials, ultimately discovering the frustratingly complex world of Dolphin controller compatibility.  Seriously, it’s a constant battle! Still chasing that perfect, seamless experience.  Anyone else battling this beast?
