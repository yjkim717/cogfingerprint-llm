Remember that frantic airport dash in 2021? I was saved by a YouTube Premium download, only to find the audio tinny and thin. I’d assumed high-quality video meant a premium sound experience. It was a classic tech lesson: convenience doesn't always equal quality. It made me pause and consider the other small compromises we make for digital ease, often without realizing what we're sacrificing. Are we trading richness for mere convenience? It’s a question that’s stuck with me.
