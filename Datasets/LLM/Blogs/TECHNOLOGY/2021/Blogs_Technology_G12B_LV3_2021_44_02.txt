>## That Rollercoaster Feeling: Penny Stocks and the Wild West of 2021

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 felt like the Wild West of investing, didn't it? I saw a post on Reddit the other day that really hit home. Someone was wrestling with whether to cash out on some penny stocks (TLSS, ABML, KODL – names I’m sure many of us recognized!) that had exploded in value. The big question? Are these legitimate opportunities, or are we caught in a "pump and dump" scheme?

It’s a scary thought, especially when you’ve seen those gains. Part of me wants to hold on, dreaming of even bigger returns. But risk management is key, right? Anyone else feeling that constant tug-of-war between excitement and caution in this market?
