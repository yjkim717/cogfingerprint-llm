## The Algorithm and Me: A Year of Learning to Listen (and Question)

It's late 2021. We’re all swimming in data, aren’t we? Every notification, every suggested article, every targeted ad… it’s relentless. And honestly, for a long time, I just went with the flow. Trusted the algorithm. Let it curate my world. 

I’m talking about everything from my Netflix recommendations (surprisingly accurate, I’ll admit) to the news feeds I consumed.  I built a comfortable digital bubble. It was *easy*.  And for a while, that easiness felt... good.  Like I was always in the know, always on top of things.

Then came the GameStop saga. I know, I know, it’s a bit cliché to bring that up now, but it genuinely shook something loose in me. I watched, along with everyone else, as retail investors, armed with memes and a shared frustration, seemingly moved the market. It felt exhilarating, chaotic, and… honestly, a bit unsettling.

It wasn’t the *event* itself that really got to me, though. It was the *reaction* to it. So many people, myself included at first, were quick to embrace narratives – narratives spun by influencers, by news outlets, by the very algorithms I'd been happily following.  There was this rush to be *on the right side* of things, to have predicted it all.

But the more I thought about it, the more uneasy I felt.  It felt like I was swallowing pre-packaged opinions whole, without really *digesting* them.  I realized I hadn't been doing my own thinking. I'd been outsourcing it.

GameStop forced me to confront a question: how much of what I believe is genuinely *my* conclusion, and how much is simply what’s been presented to me, carefully tailored to keep me engaged?

It’s been a slow process, this shift. I've started actively seeking out diverse sources of information, even (and especially) those that challenge my existing viewpoints. I’ve been trying to be more critical of headlines, to look beyond the surface level and ask, “Okay, *why* is this being presented to me this way?”

It’s harder. It takes more time. It's not nearly as satisfying as having an algorithm tell me what to think.  There's a certain comfort in confirmation bias, in being reassured that you're "right."

But there's also a deeper sense of agency, of intellectual integrity, that comes with forming your own opinions.  It’s about doing your own “DD,” as the folks online say – your own due diligence.  Not just blindly accepting what’s thrown your way.

This isn’t about becoming a contrarian for the sake of it. It
