**The Shiny Trap**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2021 was *the* year everyone was chasing the iPhone 12 Pro Max. I felt it too. My trusty (but aging) Samsung Note20 was starting to show its age, and the siren song of a new phone was strong. I finally bit the bullet and ordered through T-Mobile, opting for a device payment plan – seemed smart, right?

Except, it wasn't. A few weeks later, I discovered it was backordered, and the wait felt *endless*.  Suddenly, the glossy promise of the new phone felt less appealing and more like a frustrating trap. It made me think about how easily we get caught up in the cycle of upgrades, often paying a premium for the latest gadget.  Was it really *necessary*, or just a shiny distraction?
