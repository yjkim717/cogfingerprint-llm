I still remember the thrill of diving into DeFi in 2021—it felt like the Wild West of finance. I’d spend hours hunting for the best BNB staking pools, chasing high yields on PantherSwap, only to get stung by sneaky fee taxes. It was a rollercoaster of hope and frustration, a constant balance between risk and reward. Looking back, it taught me that in tech’s fast-paced world, sometimes the real ROI isn’t just in profits, but in the lessons learned along the way.
