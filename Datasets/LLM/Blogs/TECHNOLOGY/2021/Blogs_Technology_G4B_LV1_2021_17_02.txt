**Pixels and Panic: My First DIY Smart Lamp**

Okay, so 2021 was *the* year I decided I needed a project. Something beyond endlessly scrolling through TikTok. I stumbled across a build for an RGB LED lamp – basically, turning a bunch of tiny LEDs into a mood-setting light – and thought, “I can do that!” 

I ended up using a Raspberry Pi, some WS2812b strips (seriously, those little guys are magic), and a whole lot of YouTube tutorials.  Building it on an aluminium plate felt surprisingly sophisticated, and let’s be honest, it looked cool.  The biggest hurdle? Grounding – seriously, don’t skip that step! 

There were definitely moments of panic, soldering mishaps, and a near-total system crash. But seeing those first vibrant colours ripple across the lamp... it was a genuinely satisfying feeling. It wasn’t just about the light; it was about building something with my own hands, learning a bit about electronics, and proving to myself that I could actually tackle a slightly complicated tech project.  Who knew a little RGB LED could bring so much geeky joy?
