It’s 2021, and I’ve spent more hours than I’d like to admit wrestling with mock data for pydantic models and vanilla dataclasses. You know the feeling—tedious, repetitive, and frankly, not the most inspiring part of coding. That’s why stumbling upon pydantic-factories v0.6.0 felt like a quiet victory. Finally, a stable, thoughtful tool that handles the heavy lifting, letting me focus on building features instead of fake data. But here’s the thing: no tool is perfect from day one. I’m curious—what’s missing for you? Your insights could shape what’s next. After all, the best tools grow from real needs, not just code.
