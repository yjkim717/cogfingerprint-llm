It’s 2021, and my old mining laptops are practically melting from the heat. I’ve been chasing Monero on a budget, but replacing them felt impossible—until I stumbled on a stack of refurbished Dell Latitude i5s. At just 50 euros each, it was a gamble.

I remember unboxing that first unit, half-expecting a dud. But it hummed to life, cool and steady. Suddenly, my mining setup wasn’t just cost-effective; it felt sustainable. It’s funny how a simple, practical choice can breathe new life into a passion project. Sometimes, the smartest upgrades aren’t the flashiest—they’re the ones that just work, day after day.
