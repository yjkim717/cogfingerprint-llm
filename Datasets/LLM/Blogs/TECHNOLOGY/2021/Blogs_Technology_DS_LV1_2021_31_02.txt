**Finding the Ghost in the Machine (2021)**

Remember those old screen savers with bouncing lines? I’m trying to build the opposite—a digital petri dish that feels genuinely alive. My quest started with a simple cellular automaton, but its predictable patterns felt hollow. I wanted the digital cells to *react*, to communicate.

So, I went hunting. I spent weeks buried in biological datasets—enzyme interactions, receptor bindings, metabolic pathways. It was like learning a new, ancient language. The real magic happened when I fed this biological logic into the simulation. Suddenly, the cells weren't just following a programmer's rule; they were responding to a simulated chemical environment, making "decisions."

It’s humbling. The most profound technology might not be about building something new, but about learning to respectfully mimic the intricate systems that have existed for eons. We're not just coding; we're translating life itself.
