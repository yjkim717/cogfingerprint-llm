### The Anatomy of a Broken Mirror: Crafting a Villain with Depth

We often think of villains as forces of pure evil, but the most compelling ones are broken mirrors reflecting our own potential for darkness. When I set out to create a villain grappling with mental health issues, my biggest fear was creating a caricature—an "edgy" archetype defined solely by their trauma.

The key, I discovered, is to treat their condition as a lens, not their entire identity. My character, Kaelen, suffers from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, but it manifests not in a desire for world domination, but for absolute, sterile order. His "evil" acts are a twisted form of self-preservation; he bombs a city's power grid to plunge it into silence, a desperate attempt to quiet the overwhelming noise in his own mind.

His redemption isn't about a cure—it's about understanding. The arc begins when he is forced to rely on the very chaos he despises to survive, confronting the humanity in the imperfect world he tried to destroy. His flaws aren't just quirks; they are the engine of the plot and the source of his tragic complexity, ensuring he is a person first, and a villain second.

### The Year the Feed Broke

Remember 2021? We were all still glued to our screens, but something had shifted. My digital life, once a curated highlight reel, started to feel… fractured. The algorithms that were supposed to connect me began to feel like they were pulling me apart.

It hit me during a video call. My friend, a teacher, was describing her hybrid classroom—half the kids on a grid of faces, the other half physically present. She was essentially performing for two audiences at once. I realized our entire reality had become a hybrid. We weren't just living; we were constantly managing our digital and physical selves, and the seam between them was fraying.

That year, I started intentionally "desyncing." I’d read a book without logging it. I’d have a thought and just let it exist, without crafting a tweet. It wasn't about deleting apps, but about reclaiming mental space that the feed had colonized. Technology stopped being a place I lived and started being a tool I used. It was a small rebellion, but in a world demanding our constant digital presence, it made all the difference.
