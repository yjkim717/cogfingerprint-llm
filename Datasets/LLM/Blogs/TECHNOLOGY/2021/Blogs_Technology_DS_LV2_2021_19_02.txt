It’s funny how technology has a way of making us feel both incredibly connected and strangely isolated. I remember back in early 2021, when my world had shrunk to the size of a laptop screen. Zoom calls, virtual happy hours, and endless Slack notifications became my new normal.

At first, it was novel. I felt productive, even efficient. But after months, I started noticing the fatigue—the "Zoom gloom," as we called it. My eyes ached, and my brain felt scrambled from the constant digital chatter. I missed the unplanned moments, the shared laughter in a room, the simple warmth of human presence that no emoji could replace.

That year taught me a bittersweet lesson: technology is a powerful bridge, but it can’t replace the shore. It kept us afloat, but I’ll never take for granted the messy, beautiful reality of being together, offline and unplugged.
