"Simplifying My Home Lab with SwOS: A MikroTik CRS354 Story"

As I continued to tinker with my home lab in 2021, I found myself drawn to the MikroTik CRS354 switch. Initially, I was managing it using RouterOS, but I soon realized that its complexity was more than I needed for a simple switch. That's when I discovered SwOS, MikroTik's simplified operating system designed specifically for their switches. Switching to SwOS was a game-changer - its intuitive interface made managing my CRS354 a breeze. I was able to easily configure VLANs, set up port isolation, and monitor traffic without getting bogged down in the intricacies of RouterOS. The experience was liberating, and I was able to focus on more important things... like experimenting with new networking projects! If you're a fellow home lab enthusiast, I highly recommend giving SwOS a try - it simplified my setup and made my life easier.
