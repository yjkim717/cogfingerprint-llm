>## The Algorithm and the Application: A College Search Story

Remember endlessly refreshing your Gmail in 2021, hoping for *the* email? My college application process felt a lot like that – a constant, anxious check-in. I dove deep into CollegeVine, trusting their algorithms to spit out a "perfect" list. It was… helpful, sure. But staring at a spreadsheet of reach, target, and safety schools felt strangely detached.

It made me realize something: technology can be a tool, but it shouldn't *replace* gut feeling.  I ended up adding a few schools I’d stumbled upon through conversations with alumni, places that just *felt* right.  And you know what? Those are the schools I remember, the ones I genuinely considered home.  Sometimes, the best recommendations come from human connection, not just code.
