As I dove into the world of programming languages in 2021, I stumbled upon the C3 language and its intriguing take on type aliasing. The author's quest for inspiration to implement type and function aliases resonated with me. It made me ponder - how often do we borrow ideas from other languages, and how can we innovate within our own? The concept of macro replacement and aliasing got me thinking about the delicate balance between simplicity and expressiveness in programming languages. What are your thoughts on the matter?
