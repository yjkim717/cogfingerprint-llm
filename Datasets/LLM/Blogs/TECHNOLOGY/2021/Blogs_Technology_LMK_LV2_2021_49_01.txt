**From Classroom to Career: My Journey to Landing a Tech Job in 2021**

As I sat in my computer science lectures in 2021, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was missing out on something crucial. With a CS degree in hand, I was confident that I'd land a job at a top tech company in no time. But, the harsh reality was far from it. Despite applying to numerous positions, I faced rejection after rejection. It wasn't until I stumbled upon App Academy's bootcamp that I realized what I was lacking â€“ real-world experience.

My university had provided me with a solid foundation in programming languages, data structures, and algorithms, but I had no internship experience to speak of. I had always assumed that my CS degree would be enough to get me hired, but it seemed that employers were looking for more. They wanted candidates with hands-on experience, a portfolio of projects, and a demonstrated ability to work on real-world problems.

I decided to take the plunge and join App Academy's bootcamp, hoping it would give me the edge I needed. The intensive program pushed me to my limits, forcing me to learn by doing. I worked on real-world projects, collaborated with fellow students, and received mentorship from industry experts. It was a baptism by fire, but it was exactly what I needed.

As I progressed through the bootcamp, I started to notice a significant change in my job search outcomes. I was no longer just another CS graduate with a degree; I was a software developer with a portfolio of projects and a demonstrated ability to deliver results. I started to get noticed by top tech companies, and my rejection rate plummeted.

Looking back, I'm grateful for the journey. My CS degree had provided me with a solid foundation, but it was the App Academy bootcamp that gave me the practical skills and confidence I needed to succeed. The career services support I received was also invaluable, helping me to refine my resume, practice my coding skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

If you're a CS graduate struggling to find a job, I urge you to consider taking the bootcamp route. It's not a replacement for a CS degree, but it's a powerful supplement that can give you the edge you need to stand out in a crowded job market. With the right training and support, you can turn your classroom knowledge into a successful tech career.
