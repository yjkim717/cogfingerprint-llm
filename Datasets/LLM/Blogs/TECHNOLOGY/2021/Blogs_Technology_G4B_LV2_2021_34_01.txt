**The Escalade and the Weight of Expectations**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple question – "Is this enough?" – can suddenly feel huge. Last year, I was wrestling with a similar thought about my Cadillac Escalade. I'd just upgraded to a heavier trailer, and the standard trailering package felt…tight. 

It made me think about how technology – even something as seemingly straightforward as a trailer brake controller – is supposed to make our lives easier. But sometimes, it just highlights the limits of what we *expect* it to do.  It’s a reminder that even with the best gadgets, we still need to understand the real weight of the task at hand.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps explore a different angle?
