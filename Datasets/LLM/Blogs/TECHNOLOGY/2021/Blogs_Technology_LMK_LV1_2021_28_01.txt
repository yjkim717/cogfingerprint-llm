"Code Red: Navigating a GPA Drop in a Competitive CS Landscape"

As I stared at my junior year transcript in 2021, my heart sank - a 3.62 GPA stared back, a significant drop from my previous 3.88 unweighted GPA. With college admissions looming, I was consumed by anxiety. Had I blown my chances of getting into a top CS program? I had always been a strong student, but a tough semester had derailed my academic momentum. I wondered if I should retake the SAT to boost my scores. I also questioned whether my extracurricular activities - coding club and volunteer work - were enough to offset my GPA dip. As I reflected on my situation, I realized that this setback was an opportunity to reassess my priorities. I vowed to get back on track, focusing on regaining my academic footing and showcasing my passion for computer science. With a renewed sense of determination, I was ready to face the college admissions process head-on.
