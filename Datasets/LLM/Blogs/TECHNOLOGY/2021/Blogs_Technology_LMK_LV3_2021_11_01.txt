"Transparency Tuesday: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at My Online Shop's Success"

As I sat down to update my Constantiam shop's sales records in late 2021, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions - surprise, gratitude, and a hint of guilt. It had been a while since I'd shared an update on our progress, and I was eager to be transparent about our journey. The numbers were staggering - our full-price hoodie sale had resulted in a significant profit margin, which in turn enabled us to make substantial donations to our chosen causes. As I reflected on our ecommerce journey, I realized that embracing transparency wasn't just about sharing our successes, but also about being open about our challenges. I'm committed to doing better in the new year, and I'm excited to share our story with you, warts and all.
