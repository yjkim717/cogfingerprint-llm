"Tech Interview Travesty: A Frustrating Lesson in Time Management"

I'll never forget my disastrous job interview at CVS back in 2021. As a recent technical school graduate, I was eager to land my first gig in the tech industry. But what should have been a straightforward interview turned into a frustrating waste of time. The manager seemed disorganized and unprepared, asking me generic questions that didn't even relate to the job description. It soon became clear that they had no intention of hiring me – or anyone else, for that matter. The whole ordeal left a sour taste, making me wonder how many other job seekers had suffered the same fate. It got me thinking: in today's fast-paced tech world, why do some hiring managers still fail to respect people's time? As I navigated the job market, I learned to be more discerning and prepared – and I hope to spare others the same frustration.
