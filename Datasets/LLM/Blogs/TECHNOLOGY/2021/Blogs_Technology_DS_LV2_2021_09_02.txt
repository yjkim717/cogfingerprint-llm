It’s 2021, and I’m watching my teammates in KotK chase kills while the zone shrinks around us. It reminds me of how often we get distracted by digital dopamine hits—endless scrolling, notifications—instead of focusing on what truly matters. We’re all guilty of prioritizing the flashy over the fundamental, whether in games or life. Maybe it’s time to pause, assess the real objectives, and push forward together. After all, winning takes more than just quick reflexes.
