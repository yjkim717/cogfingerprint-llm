Back in 2021, I remember trying to watch a vertical video on my PC, only to have it awkwardly letterboxed. I missed the mobile VLC’s simple “fit to screen” crop. It struck me how our tech habits, shaped by phones, don't always translate to desktops. It’s a small reminder that convenience often dictates how we expect our tools to adapt, no matter the screen size.
