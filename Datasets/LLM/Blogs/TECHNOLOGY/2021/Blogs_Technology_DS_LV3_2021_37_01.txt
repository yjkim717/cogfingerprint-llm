Remember trying to watch vertical videos on my PC in 2021? They’d appear as tiny rectangles with black bars swallowing the screen. I missed that simple "fit to screen" crop from my phone. Then I discovered VLC’s aspect ratio tool—suddenly my portrait videos filled the display perfectly. It was a small victory, but it transformed my viewing experience, making everything feel more immersive and intentional. Sometimes the smallest tweaks make all the difference.
