As a recent graduate entering the professional world in 2021, I found myself wondering if a fancy watch was necessary. I settled on a G-Shock GST-B100, and it's been a game-changer. Not only is it a stylish accessory, but its durability and features have also boosted my confidence. For under $3000, I found a quality watch that perfectly balances form and function, making it an ideal choice for professional settings.
