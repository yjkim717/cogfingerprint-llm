It was 2021, and our network was down. My heart sank. The only lifeline was our dusty backup Cisco 2811, a relic I’d never properly vetted. As I prepared to load the production router's running config onto it, a chilling thought hit me: the IOS versions were different.

Would this digital transplant even take? I was gambling our entire company's connectivity on compatibility I hadn't verified. It felt like trying to start a modern car with a key from a different model. That moment of frantic uncertainty taught me a profound lesson about IT preparedness. It’s not just about having a backup; it’s about ensuring that backup can actually speak the same language when disaster strikes. A lesson learned the hard way.
