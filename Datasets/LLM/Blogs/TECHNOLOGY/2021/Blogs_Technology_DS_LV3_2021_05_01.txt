It’s 2021, and I’m halfway across the world, starting a new life as a tech worker in the Bay Area. The excitement of innovation hums in the air, but so do quieter, more personal questions. As an immigrant, every new experience feels amplified—especially navigating daily safety.

I remember my first evening, hesitating before a walk to the grocery store. Is this neighborhood walkable? Is public transport reliable after dark? My phone was filled with searches for legal self-defense tools, a strange contrast to the sleek apps I build for a living.

Technology connects us globally, yet here I was, feeling the very human need for security in an unfamiliar place. It’s a reminder that behind every line of code and every innovation, there’s a person just trying to feel at home. We’re not just building the future; we’re learning to live in it, one cautious step at a time.
