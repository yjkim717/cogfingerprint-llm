It’s 2021, and I’ve spent years wrestling with my desktop setup—always chasing that perfect balance between power and simplicity. Then I discovered tiling window managers, and dwm in particular. At first, it felt like stepping into a cockpit: all function, no fluff. But the real magic? Modern features that don’t demand endless config files. I’ve got a sleek status bar now, showing system stats at a glance, and it’s surprisingly user-friendly. No more drowning in distractions; everything flows. It’s not just about managing windows—it’s about reclaiming focus, one tile at a time. Who knew efficiency could feel so effortless?
