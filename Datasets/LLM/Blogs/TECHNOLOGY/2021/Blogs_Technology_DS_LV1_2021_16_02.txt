### The Unseen Proficiency Bonus

I was watching my friend, a total newbie, fumble with our video call software the other day. Her mic was muted, her video was a frozen snapshot from five minutes ago. It was a classic case of failed "Technology Checks." It got me thinking about 2021's great remote-work experiment. We were all suddenly players in a game with complex rules we never had to learn before.

It reminded me of a request from my D&D group: more in-game tutorials. Not everyone intuitively knows to add their "proficiency bonus" to an attack roll or that a high Armor Class is your best friend. Similarly, we can't assume everyone knows the keyboard shortcut to share screen or where the "report a bug" button is hidden.

The best tools, whether a fantasy TTRPG or a video conferencing app, don't just have powerful features. They have elegant, integrated guidance. They make the user feel proficient from the start, turning potential frustration into a critical hit. The real "saving throw" is designing systems that help you succeed before you even know you need to make the roll.
