It’s 2021, and my mining setup is limping along—literally. Two of my old laptops sound like jet engines, and one has a screen that flickers like a disco ball. So, I’m eyeing a risky little experiment: buying three or four refurbished Dell i5 laptops for just 50 euros each.

The idea is simple—replace the tired hardware and quietly mine Monero in the background. Sure, it’s not a gold rush, but there’s something oddly satisfying about giving these discarded machines a second life. If it works, great. If not, well, at least I tried. Sometimes, tech isn’t about the cutting edge—it’s about making do and dreaming small.
