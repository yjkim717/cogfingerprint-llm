"Mapping Azure Storage as a Network Drive via GPO - A 2021 Retrospective"

As I navigated the complexities of cloud storage in 2021, a common question kept popping up: how to seamlessly map an Azure Storage drive to users' machines without requiring manual authentication. Group Policy Objects (GPO) seemed like the answer, but there were concerns about NTFS permissions and potential pitfalls. I dug into the world of AzureAD and Azure File Share to find the solution. By combining GPO with Azure's built-in features, I discovered a robust method to simplify drive mapping while maintaining granular NTFS permissions. Here's my journey and the best practices I uncovered along the way.
