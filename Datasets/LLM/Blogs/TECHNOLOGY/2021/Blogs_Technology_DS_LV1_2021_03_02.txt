### The Ultimate Kombat Flip: Reimagining Every Fighter

What if the entire Mortal Kombat universe underwent a massive gender swap? Imagine stepping into the arena not as Scorpion, but as a vengeful specter named Scorpia, her kunai whip cracking with hellfire. Picture a regal, powerful King Liu Kang commanding the power of the dragon, or a cunning and brutal Baroness Kano leading the Black Dragon clan.

This fan-proposed flip of the entire character roster isn't just a simple palette swap; it's a creative reimagining of the franchise's core mythology. How would the dynamic between a heroic Sonya Blade and a villainous Johnny Cage change if their genders were reversed?

It was the year I learned that sometimes, the smartest tech knows when to be quiet.
