>## The Ghosts in the Machine (and My Lost Registration)

Okay, so I'm officially adding "fighting bureaucracy in the digital age" to my list of life skills. It started innocently enough – renewing my car registration online. Seemed simple, right? 2021, everything’s online! 

Except, the system apparently thinks I own a car I *don’t* own. And now I’m getting tickets. Seriously. I’ve spent hours on hold with the DMV, jumping through digital hoops, arguing with automated voices that just… don’t listen. 

It's a weird feeling, isn't it? To be battling a faceless algorithm for something so basic. It makes you question the promise of technology, the ease it was supposed to bring. Instead, I'm left feeling powerless, a tiny cog caught in a giant, glitchy machine. 

Anyone else feel like the future isn’t quite as streamlined as they promised? Send coffee (and maybe some legal advice!).
