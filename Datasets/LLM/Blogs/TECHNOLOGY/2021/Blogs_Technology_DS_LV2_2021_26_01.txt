It’s 2021, and I’m still working from my kitchen table. After months of muffled Zoom calls, I finally upgraded to a used Samson G-Track Pro USB mic. Plugged it into my Windows 10 laptop, fiddled with the desk mount, and even peeked at the MOTU software. Suddenly, my voice was crisp and clear—no more sounding like I was in a tin can. It’s funny how a simple piece of tech, this little condenser mic, made such a difference. It wasn't just an upgrade; it was a small act of reclaiming my presence.
