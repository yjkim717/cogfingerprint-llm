**The Shiny Object Syndrome & That $400 Feeling**

Okay, let's be real. 2021 was *weird*. Remember that whole GameStop thing? The Reddit frenzy? Honestly, I spent a good chunk of the summer glued to the forums, watching the GME rollercoaster with a mix of genuine excitement and a growing sense of, well, unease. 

I wasn't a day trader, not really. But I got caught up in the hype. A friend – let’s call him ‘Mark’ – kept throwing out these wild price targets, something around $400 a share. It felt… possible. Like, *really* possible. And suddenly, I was convinced I could get in on the ground floor, make a killing, and prove everyone who’d ever doubted me wrong. 

I invested a decent chunk of change – around $400, actually – and the initial surge was exhilarating. Seeing the numbers tick up felt incredible. But then the ride started to get *really* bumpy. Suddenly, everyone was talking about hedge funds, short squeezes, and the inherent instability of relying on other people's opinions. 

Mark, bless his heart, was still confidently predicting $500. Meanwhile, I was staring at a steadily declining stock, feeling a whole lot of regret. 

It wasn’t about the money, not really. It was about the feeling of being swept up in something, of chasing the next shiny object, and letting the opinions of strangers dictate my decisions. 

Looking back, it was a valuable, albeit painful, lesson. Technology, and the internet, are incredible tools – they connect us, inform us, and can even create incredible opportunities. But they can also amplify our fears, feed our biases, and lead us down rabbit holes of impulsive decisions.
