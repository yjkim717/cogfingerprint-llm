>## The Unexpected Comfort of Analog in a Digital World (2021)

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re drowning in screens. Notifications pinging, data streams flowing – it’s 2021 and our lives are undeniably digital. But lately, I’ve found myself craving something… different. Something tactile. Something *not* glowing.

I recently bought a simple analog watch. No smart features, no fitness tracking, just hands and a face. And surprisingly, it's been incredibly grounding. It’s a tiny, deliberate disconnect from the constant buzz. A reminder that time moves forward, regardless of how many emails I have in my inbox. Maybe it’s a weird trend, but I'm embracing the quiet simplicity.
