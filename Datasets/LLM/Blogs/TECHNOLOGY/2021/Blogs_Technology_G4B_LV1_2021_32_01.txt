**Swapping Switches: A Little MikroTik Revelation**

Okay, so 2021 was a weird year, right? I was wrestling with a seriously overloaded MikroTik CRS354 switch – juggling way too many VLANs and interfaces. RouterOS was starting to feel… clunky. Then, on a late-night whim, I decided to dive into SwOS 2.13. 

Honestly, it was a surprisingly smooth process. Within a few hours, I’d migrated everything. And you know what? It was *better*. The interface felt so much cleaner, more intuitive. Suddenly, managing those complex VLANs wasn’t a frustrating headache. 

It’s funny how a simple OS upgrade can completely change your experience. It’s a good reminder that sometimes, a little experimentation – and a fresh perspective – can unlock a whole new level of efficiency.  Anyone else had a similar switch upgrade win?
