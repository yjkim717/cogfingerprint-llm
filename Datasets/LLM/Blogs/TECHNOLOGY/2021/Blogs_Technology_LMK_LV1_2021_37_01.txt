As I watched my favorite concert video on VLC player in 2021, I was frustrated to see black bars on either side due to its portrait orientation. I wished for a 'fit to screen' option to crop the video, just like on my smartphone. Alas, the PC version didn't seem to have this feature. After some digging, I discovered VLC's aspect ratio adjustment feature, which allowed me to tweak the settings and enjoy a full-screen viewing experience.
