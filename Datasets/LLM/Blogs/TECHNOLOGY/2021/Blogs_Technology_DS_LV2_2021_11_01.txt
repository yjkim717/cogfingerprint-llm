It’s 2021, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how much of our lives have migrated online. I just finished reading about a Minecraft server shop owner who shared their sales and donation numbers with total transparency—something that feels rare these days. It reminded me of my own journey with tech.

I used to see technology as this cold, distant force—all code and circuits. But over time, I’ve realized it’s built by people, for people. That Minecraft shop owner didn’t just list numbers; they told a story of community support, of players chipping in to keep a virtual world alive. It’s humbling.

In a year where so much felt disconnected, these small digital spaces became our town squares, our coffee shops. Tech isn’t just about innovation; it’s about connection. And maybe, in being more open about how we build and sustain these spaces, we’re rediscovering what it means to create something together.
