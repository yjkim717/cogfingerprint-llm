As I scrolled through my company's surplus sale listings in 2021, a sneaky idea struck me - why not snag some refurbished i5 laptops at a steal and put them to work mining Monero? The thought of turning these underutilized machines into cryptocurrency-generating powerhouses was too enticing to resist. With the rise of digital currencies, I saw an opportunity to breathe new life into old tech and potentially earn some extra cash. Little did I know, this venture would teach me a thing or two about the resourcefulness of technology.
