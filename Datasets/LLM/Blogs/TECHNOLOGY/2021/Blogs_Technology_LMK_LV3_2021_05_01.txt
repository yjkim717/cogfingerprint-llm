As a tech worker from abroad, I was drawn to the SF Bay Area's innovation hub in 2021. But with rising post-Covid concerns, I wondered: is it safe? Navigating unfamiliar streets and public transport made me think about self-defence and personal safety. I realized that like many cities, the Bay Area has its safe and not-so-safe areas. By being aware of my surroundings and taking simple precautions, I felt more at ease. For fellow immigrant tech workers, I share my experiences: staying informed and prepared can make all the difference in feeling secure in a new city.
