## The Algorithm and My College Dreams

Okay, so I’m officially in the thick of college application season. It’s…a lot. And I’ve been leaning *heavily* on CollegeVine. Their school match tool seemed promising, you know? A little algorithmic hand-holding to guide me through this overwhelming process. 

But lately, I've been questioning it. Are these "target" and "safety" school designations *really* accurate? It’s comforting to have a list, sure, but it also feels a little… impersonal. Like my future is being decided by a formula. 

I’m trying to remember that ultimately, these are just tools. My grades, my essays, my experiences – *that's* what matters. It's 2021, and even with all the tech at our fingertips, the human element still needs to shine through. Right?
