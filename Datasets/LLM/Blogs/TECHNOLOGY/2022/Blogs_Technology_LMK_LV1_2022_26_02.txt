Upgrading my gaming rig has been on my mind for a while now. I've been rocking an Asrock H470 motherboard with a Nvidia GeForce 2070 Super, and while it's served me well, I've been itching for a performance boost. The question is, what's the best CPU upgrade for my setup? I've been eyeing the Intel i5 and i7 options, but I'm not sure which one to choose. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking about how far CPU technology has come - it's crazy to think that the processors we considered top-of-the-line just a few years ago are now being replaced by even more powerful models. For now, I'm leaning towards an i5 upgrade, mainly because it should give me a nice bump in gaming performance without breaking the bank. Plus, with my existing RAM, I should be able to take advantage of faster memory speeds.
