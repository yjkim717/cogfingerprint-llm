It’s 2022, and I’m still amazed by how technology quietly reshapes our daily lives. Just last week, I watched a documentary on automated fulfillment centers—how they sort, pack, and ship clothing across the EU and US with robotic precision. It struck me: these systems manage inventory and backorders so seamlessly, yet most of us never see the intricate dance of code and machinery behind our "Add to Cart" clicks. It’s a reminder that innovation isn’t always flashy gadgets; sometimes, it’s the invisible threads weaving convenience into our world, making the complex feel effortless.
