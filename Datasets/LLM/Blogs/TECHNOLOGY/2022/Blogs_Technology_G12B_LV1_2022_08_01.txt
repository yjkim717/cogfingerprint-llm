## The Unexpected Side Effect of Exploring Europe (and My Apple Watch)

Okay, so I’m back from a whirlwind trip through Europe, and something’s…weird. I’m sleeping. *A lot.* Like, 11-12 hours a night. Jetlag, I figured. Lots of time zone hopping will do that to you. But it's been weeks, and the exhaustion lingers.

I started obsessively checking my Apple Watch, trying to find a clue. My active calorie burn? Pretty standard for someone trying to walk 15,000 steps a day while sightseeing. It's just…strange. 

It got me thinking. Are we so focused on *tracking* activity that we miss the underlying signals? Maybe my body is still processing the sheer sensory overload of new cultures, new foods, new everything. Maybe my Apple Watch is just a fancy mirror reflecting a deeper need for rest. I'm going to ease up on the data and just…listen to my body for a bit. Anyone else experienced something similar?
