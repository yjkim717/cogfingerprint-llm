**The Unexpected Burn of Remembering**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a tiny, seemingly innocuous thing can suddenly trigger a flood of memories and a little bit of… discomfort? Last week, I was cleaning out an old toolbox – a relic from my days tinkering with electronics – and I found a pair of welding gloves.  

They were covered in dried-up grease, obviously. But it was the thought that made me wince. I remembered a workshop I’d done a few years back, experimenting with some high-powered LEDs. I’d reused a glove, thinking it was quick and easy, and ended up with a seriously painful hand. 

It wasn’t the heat of the LEDs, honestly. It was the ghost pepper spice I’d been using to create a ‘flavor’ effect (don’t ask!).  The point is, even with all the amazing tech we have now – the instant connections, the endless information – sometimes the simplest mistakes, the small shortcuts, still sting. It’s a reminder to really *remember* the process, and to be mindful of the potential for unexpected consequences, even in our digital lives.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps focus on a different angle?
