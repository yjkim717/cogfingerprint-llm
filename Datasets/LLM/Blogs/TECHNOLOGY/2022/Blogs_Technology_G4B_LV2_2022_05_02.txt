**The Weight of a Sausage Roll & a Screen**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple craving can trigger a whole avalanche of memories. I was scrolling through Instagram last week – just a mindless scroll, really – when a picture of a golden-brown sausage roll popped up. Instantly, I was back in Melbourne, staring out at the grey rain, desperately missing the vibrant chaos of Japan. 

You see, I’d just come back from nearly two years abroad, a proper reset. And stepping back into my old life felt…weird. It wasn’t the dramatic, Hollywood-style ‘reverse culture shock’ you read about, but a quiet, unsettling shift. The cafes were the same, the trams rattled along, but *everything* felt subtly different. 

It made me think about technology’s role in all this. I’d used video calls to stay connected, to bridge the distance, but it’s no substitute for actually *being* somewhere.  The digital connection felt thin, almost ghostly, compared to the richness of a real conversation over a shared sausage roll (a Melbourne staple, obviously!). 

As I looked back at my photos from Japan, I realised how much I’d relied on my phone to document it all.  Maybe, just maybe, the next adventure needs to be a little less screen time and a lot more experiencing.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect?
