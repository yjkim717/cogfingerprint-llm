**The Tightrope of Tiny Businesses Online**

Remember scrolling through Instagram in 2022, seeing a million little shops selling handcrafted things? I was fascinated by the sheer ambition – especially when I read about an entrepreneur trying to launch a sustainable underwear brand at cost. It’s a beautiful idea, right? But the online world felt like a tightrope walk. 

Suddenly, everything is about “market demand” and “pricing,” and it’s easy to get lost in the algorithms.  Building a small e-commerce business, especially one rooted in values like sustainable clothing, demands more than just a pretty website. It’s about connecting, truly connecting, with people who *get* it – a challenge for any small business trying to stand out.
