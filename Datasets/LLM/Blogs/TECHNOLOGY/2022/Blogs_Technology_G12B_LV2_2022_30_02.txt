>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a conversational, reflective, and relatable tone, and set in 2022.  I've included a title suggestion at the top.

**Title: The Algorithm of Anxiety: Job Hunting in the TikTok Era**

It’s wild out there, right? 2022 has been… a lot. And the job hunt? It’s evolved. I'm currently waiting on a potential offer from TikTok – a seriously exciting opportunity! But alongside the thrill, there's a new layer of anxiety. It's not just about skills anymore. 

I’ve found myself deep-diving into company reviews, scrolling through Glassdoor and even, surprisingly, TikTok itself, searching for glimpses into work-life balance. It feels strange, relying on short-form videos and anonymous comments to gauge the culture of a place. Is this how we’re all vetting our futures now? 

It makes you wonder – are we prioritizing the *brand* of a company over the actual experience? Hopefully, I'll have a firsthand answer soon. Wish me luck!

**Notes on the approach:**

*   **Conversational:** Used phrases like "It’s wild out there, right?" and "It makes you wonder…"
*   **Relatable:** Tapped into the common experience of job hunting and the anxieties surrounding it.
*   **Reflective:** Explored the shift in how people research companies, particularly with the rise of platforms like TikTok.
*   **Storytelling:** Framed it around a personal experience (awaiting a job offer).
*   **Year Context:** The phrase "2022 has been… a lot" grounds it in the specific time period.
