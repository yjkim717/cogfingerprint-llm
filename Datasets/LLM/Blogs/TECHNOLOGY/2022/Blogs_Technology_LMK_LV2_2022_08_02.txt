"When 'Open to Work' Becomes a Heavy Burden: Finding Self-Care in a Sea of Job Rejections"

I still remember the day I proudly updated my LinkedIn status to "Open to Work" in early 2022, eager to dive into new opportunities. But as the weeks went by, the excitement wore off, replaced by the harsh reality of repeated job rejections. The constant "not good enough" stung, and I found myself questioning my worth. I was applying to numerous jobs, tailoring my resume and cover letter, but the responses were scarce. I began to feel like I was losing myself in the process. To cope, I had to prioritize self-care - taking long walks, practicing mindfulness, and reconnecting with loved ones. If you're struggling like I was, remember that your worth isn't defined by your job title. Take care of yourself, and don't be afraid to show up as you are, "Open to Work" or not.
