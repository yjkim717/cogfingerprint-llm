As I dove into Skyrim with the Cathedral Weathers and Seasons mod, I wondered: would it tank my laptop's performance? After installation, I was pleasantly surprised - the game's visuals soared, and frame rates remained smooth. It was a game-changer, proving that great mods can enhance gaming without sacrificing playability.
