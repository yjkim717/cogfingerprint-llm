Back in 2022, I remember scraping financial news for a class project, my Python scripts pulling data into the wee hours. It felt like magicâ€”turning chaotic headlines into clean trends. But the real spark wasn't the code; it was realizing how tech could whisper market secrets. That project, blending semantic analysis with forecasting, solidified my path. Sometimes, it's the hands-on tinkering that reveals your true direction, one dataset at a time.
