**The Ghost in the App**

There’s something deeply unsettling about losing track of your data, isn’t there? I was wrestling with Blockfolio last week, trying to meticulously log my crypto trades – a habit I thought would bring order to the chaos. But then, a frustrating technical issue started wiping out my manual entries. It felt like the app was erasing my history, a little ghost haunting my investment journey.  It’s a stark reminder that even with the best tech, we’re still reliant on these systems, and they can let us down.  A frustrating experience, for sure!
