Remember that viral meme of the dancing cat? Last week, I saw it for sale as an NFT, but someone had just put a tiny hat on it. It got me thinking in 2022: is slapping a digital accessory on something that doesn't belong to you a mark of originality, or are we just formalizing theft? The line between creative remix and illegal sale feels thinner than ever.
