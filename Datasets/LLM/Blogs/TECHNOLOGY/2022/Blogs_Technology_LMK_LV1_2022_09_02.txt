"As I dove back into my favorite multiplayer game in 2022, I couldn't help but get frustrated with 'snipe campers' - players who hide in safe spots, waiting for others to do the heavy lifting. Effective teamwork is key to victory, and when some players don't pull their weight, it can be game over. I've learned that coordination is everything; when we work together, we can conquer even the toughest challenges and come out on top."
