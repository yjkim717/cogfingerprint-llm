It’s 2022, and I’m sitting in my small apartment in Dublin, staring at a screen that feels like both a barrier and a bridge. I had no formal IT background, no fancy connections—just a laptop and a stubborn belief that I could build a career from scratch.

The journey wasn’t glamorous. I started with free online courses, often late at night after my day job. I’d troubleshoot code until my eyes blurred, fueled by tea and the quiet hum of a sleeping city. Remote work became my reality, turning my kitchen table into an office and my solitude into focus.

What kept me going? Knowing that in Ireland, and across the world, others were doing the same—learning, adapting, and finding their way without a roadmap. It’s not about having all the answers; it’s about taking one practical step after another. If you’re starting out with little but big dreams, remember: every expert was once a beginner, just like you and me.
