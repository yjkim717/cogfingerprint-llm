**The Ghost in the Matrix: Why NumPy’s Eigenvectors Confuse Me**

Okay, so I was wrestling with NumPy’s `linalg.eig` function last month, and honestly, I felt completely lost. It spits out these “eigenvectors” and “eigenvalues,” but the original array just… sits there. Like, it’s been transformed, but I can’t *see* the transformation happening. It’s a weird, unsettling feeling – a ghost in the matrix!  It really made me think about what it *means* for data to change, even when it looks the same.
