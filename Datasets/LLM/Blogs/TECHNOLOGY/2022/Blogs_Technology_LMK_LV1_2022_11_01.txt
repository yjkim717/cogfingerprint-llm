As I swipe through my feeds, I'm struck by our tech-driven world's eerie parallels to theological debates. Like some assert the existence of a higher power, many assume AI will inevitably surpass human intelligence. But I'm not convinced. I'm not an agnostic on the matter; I firmly believe that AI, no matter how advanced, is still a tool created by humans. There's no divine spark here. Our innovations are remarkable, but they don't necessitate a leap of faith. Let's acknowledge the impressive tech we've built, while staying grounded in its human origins.
