**Tiny Box, Big Dreams: My Quest for Simple Linux Control**

There’s something deeply satisfying about a little Linux NUC – a pocket-sized computer that just *works*. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with a frustrating little problem: wanting to use it without a full-blown desktop setup. I crave the simplicity of just typing and clicking, you know?

I spent a frustrating week trying different remote control solutions.  i3wm and Wayland felt powerful, but also intimidating.  Finally, a lightweight keyboard and mouse combo unlocked a surprisingly smooth experience. It’s amazing how much control you need just to feel truly *at* your computer. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most elegant tech is the stuff that disappears – the tools that let you just *do*, without the fuss.  Anyone else have a similar experience with tiny, powerful machines?
