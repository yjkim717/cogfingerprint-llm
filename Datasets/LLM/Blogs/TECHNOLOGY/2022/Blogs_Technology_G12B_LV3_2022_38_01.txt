## The Little Things Matter: Finding Free Video Editing Flexibility

Okay, so I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day – someone just needing to nudge a video clip a few degrees. Seems small, right? But it got me thinking! We're often chasing the *big* features in video editing software, but sometimes it’s those little adjustments – a slight rotation to straighten a horizon, for instance – that really polish a project. Luckily, there’s plenty of free software out there that can handle those minor tweaks in 2022. Anyone else find joy in the details?
