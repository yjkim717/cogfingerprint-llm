>## The App I Almost Deleted (and Why You Shouldn't Dismiss the "Side Quests" of Tech)

Okay, let's be honest. We all have *that* app. The one we downloaded with good intentions, maybe even a burst of enthusiasm, but now it just… sits there. For me, it was a language learning app. I started with such fervor, picturing myself confidently ordering croissants in Paris. But then life got busy, the lessons felt repetitive, and I was about to hit that delete button.

Then I remembered something I read about the *Throne of Glass* book series – specifically, *Tower of Dawn*. So many people skip it, claiming it's a slow burn and doesn't advance the main plot. But apparently, it's *crucial* for understanding the world and the characters. 

It hit me: maybe the "side quests" in our lives, even the tech ones, are important too. Maybe that language app isn't about fluency, but about expanding my perspective, learning a little bit about a different culture, keeping my brain engaged. I haven't become fluent, but I *did* learn a few useful phrases, and I feel a little more connected to the world. Sometimes, the seemingly unnecessary detours are where the real growth happens. Don't be too quick to delete – you might be missing out on something valuable.
