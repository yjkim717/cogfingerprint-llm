>## The Little Things That Annoy You: iPhone Voicemail Blues

It's funny how the things that frustrate you most aren't always the big, headline-grabbing tech fails. Lately, I've been simmering over something surprisingly small: my iPhone 13's voicemail. 

I upgraded from an iPhone 11, then a 12, both on Verizon, and always appreciated how seamlessly the voicemail integrated – a unified inbox, easy transcription, the works. Now, with the 13, it’s... different. Clunky, even. Suddenly I’m dealing with a separate app and a less intuitive system. 

It's a minor inconvenience, sure. But it highlights a weird truth about technology: we adapt, we enjoy certain features, and then a change, even a seemingly small one, can throw everything off. It just makes me miss the fluidity I was used to. Anyone else feeling this way about something similar?
