The Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ) online community has lost its way. What was once a vibrant, humorous space has given way to seriousness. Scrolling through Reddit forums, I'm disheartened to see the balance that once made TAZ so special now disrupted. The excess of solemnity is suffocating the community's spirit. Can we find a way to restore the harmony between substance and humor, or is it too late?
