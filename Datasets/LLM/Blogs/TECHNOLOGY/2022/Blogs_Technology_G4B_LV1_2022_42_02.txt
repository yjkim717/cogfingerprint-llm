**The Year I Ditched the Starch (and Maybe Found Myself)**

Okay, 2022 was… a year. I’d spent the last few years meticulously swapping out sugary drinks and bread – a full-blown low-carb kick. It felt like a huge victory, a conscious reclaiming of my health. Then, I hit a wall: potatoes and rice. Seriously, those staples felt like anchors. 

So, I started researching alternatives.  It led me down a rabbit hole of cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, and experimenting with different root vegetables.  But honestly? It made me think about how we’re *always* looking for the next ‘better’ thing with technology.  We upgrade our phones, our software, chasing optimization.  Maybe sometimes, the ‘good enough’ - like a simple potato – is exactly what we need, and the constant search for something *more* is actually distracting us from what truly matters.
