**Echoes of a Build**

It’s funny how a little hardware swap can trigger a memory lane trip. Last fall, I was scouring Reddit for a decent used PC build – specifically, a Ryzen 7 2700X and an MSI B450 Tomahawk.  It wasn't about the latest specs, just a reliable machine to get me through the long autumn nights.  Paying with PayPal felt…safe, back then.  Now, staring at my sleek new laptop, I realize it’s not about the *parts* themselves, but the satisfaction of piecing something together, a little digital Frankenstein’s monster brought to life.
