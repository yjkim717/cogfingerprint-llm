### The Day We Almost Lost the Keys to the Kingdom

It was 2022, and I’ll never forget the pit in my stomach when our two sysadmins looked at each other in panic. A failed update had locked them *both* out of our Active Directory. No administrative privileges. No access to the domain controller. Our small business was frozen.

We’d always operated on trust, but that day revealed a fatal flaw: we had no emergency break-glass procedure. In the frantic hours that followed (thankfully, we had a recent backup), I realized that robust security isn't just about keeping people out; it's about ensuring the right people can get *in* during a crisis.

The lesson was clear. We immediately designed a dual-control system, splitting emergency credentials so no single person holds all the power. It’s a simple, sobering truth: the most critical access is the one you hope you never need.
