## Remember Dial-Up? A Little Nostalgia & a Lot of Perspective

It’s wild to think back, isn’t it? Just a few years ago, we were battling buffering videos and the screech of dial-up. Now, I’m video-calling family across the globe with crystal clarity. 

Sometimes, amidst the constant upgrades and new apps, I pause. We chase the “next best thing” so relentlessly. Do we ever really appreciate how far we’ve come? I caught myself explaining what a "modem" was to my niece the other day. It felt like a lifetime ago, and a good reminder to savor the present – even with its own tech quirks.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
