There I was in 2022, cozy on my couch, ready to dive back into Termina on my Android. Citra MMJ had been my trusty portal to nostalgia—until Majora’s Mask 3D crashed at the worst moment. Even Citra Enhanced called my files "encrypted," though I’d decrypted them myself! It’s funny how emulation, this bridge to the past, still has its mysterious gaps. Sometimes, tech reminds us that magic—and glitches—are part of the journey.
