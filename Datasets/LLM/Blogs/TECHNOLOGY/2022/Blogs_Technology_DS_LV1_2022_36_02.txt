It’s late 2022, and I’m wrestling with Firefox 108.0.1 on my new Windows 11 machine—YouTube just won’t load. I’ve tried it all: disabling extensions, clearing appdata, even a full reinstall. Nothing. It’s a stark reminder of how fragile our digital tools can be, even the most trusted ones. Sometimes, the sleekest updates bring the clunkiest surprises. Makes you wonder if we’re truly in control, or just along for the ride.
