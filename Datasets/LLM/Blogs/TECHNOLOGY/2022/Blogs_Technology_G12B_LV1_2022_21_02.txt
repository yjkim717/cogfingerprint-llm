>## The Algorithm and the Apprenticeship: A 2022 Reflection

It's funny, isn't it? In 2022, we're obsessed with algorithms predicting our next move, curating our feeds, and automating… well, everything. Yet, I'm finding myself increasingly drawn to something decidedly *un*-algorithmic: the idea of practical experience.

I just turned 19, fresh out of school, and the pressure to have a grand plan is real. Everyone's talking about startups, coding bootcamps, the "next big thing." But I'm feeling pulled towards something a little different. I’m exploring freelance projects, dipping my toes into self-employment, almost like a modern apprenticeship. 

It's messy. There's paperwork (kindergeld, Krankenversicherung – the German joys!), uncertainty, and a whole lot of learning by doing. But it feels *real*. It's a human experience, navigating challenges, building skills, and figuring things out, all without the sterile precision of an algorithm. Maybe the best innovation isn't always about coding a new app, but about embracing the beautiful chaos of learning through practical work.



Hope this suits!
