"Is the tech gravy train worth the grind? With the industry booming in 2022, it's no secret that tech salaries are the envy of many. But have you ever stopped to think about what's driving those fat paychecks? I've been pondering whether the most lucrative tech jobs are also the most demanding. Do higher paying gigs mean longer hours, more stress, and a never-ending to-do list? I've seen friends in high-paying roles burning out, sacrificing their work-life balance for the sake of a bigger salary. Meanwhile, others in more modestly paid positions seem to enjoy a more relaxed pace. Is it a case of 'you get what you pay for,' or are we just paying for the privilege of being overworked? As we navigate the ever-changing tech landscape, it's worth considering what's really driving those job offers â€“ and whether it's all worth it in the end."
