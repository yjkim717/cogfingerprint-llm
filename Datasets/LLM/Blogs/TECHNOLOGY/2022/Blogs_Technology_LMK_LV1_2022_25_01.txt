"Renewing ADFS Certificates: A 2022 Retrospective"

As I sat staring at the 'AD FS could not detect other machines joined to this farm' error message on my screen, I couldn't help but think of the countless hours I'd spent wrestling with ADFS certificate renewals. It was 2022, and I was working with Windows Server 2016. The task seemed straightforward, but the Set-AdfsSslCertificate cmdlet was throwing a wrench in the works. After some digging, I discovered that the issue was tied to the Farm Behavior Level (FBL). It turned out that my FBL was still set to a lower level, which was causing the detection issue. Raising the FBL to the latest level resolved the problem, and I was able to successfully update the SSL certificate. Looking back, it's clear that understanding the intricacies of ADFS configurations is crucial in avoiding such roadblocks. If you're facing similar issues, take a closer look at your FBL â€“ it might just be the key to a smooth certificate renewal.
