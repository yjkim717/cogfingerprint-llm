## My Highlighter Dreams and the Digital Note-Taking Quest

Okay, I'm officially admitting it: I'm a highlighter addict. Always have been. But juggling physical textbooks and a mountain of brightly colored annotations? It’s a recipe for chaos. This year (2022), I've been on a mission to digitize that process.

I'm hunting for the *perfect* note-taking app. Not just any app, mind you. I need one that understands the power of a yellow highlight. Specifically, I want to be able to *search* my notes based on highlighter color. Imagine: "Show me everything I highlighted in pink related to cellular respiration!" 

It sounds simple, but finding an app that handles PDF textbooks – or even image scans of pages – with that level of granularity has been surprisingly tricky. The search continues! Anyone else out there battling the digital note-taking frontier? Let me know your favorites!
