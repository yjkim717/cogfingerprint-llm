It’s 2022, and I’ve finally moved the Constantiam donation shop to its own website—not because I had to, but because I wanted to. For years, I’d relied on Patreon and other platforms, but something felt missing. I wanted a space where creativity could breathe, free from commercial pressure.

Now, on this new site, I’m blending web design with server resources in ways that feel genuinely meaningful. It’s not just about donations; it’s about crafting an experience that reflects what Constantiam stands for. I’ve poured my heart into every detail, from the layout to the resources we share.

It’s refreshing to build something just because I love it—no algorithms, no rush. Here’s to creating with purpose, and sharing it with all of you.
