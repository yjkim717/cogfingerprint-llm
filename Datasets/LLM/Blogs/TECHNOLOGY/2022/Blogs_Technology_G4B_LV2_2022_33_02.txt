**The Ghosts in the Comments**

Remember when YouTube comments felt…alive? Now, it’s like wading through a digital fog. Lately, I’ve been battling a frustrating glitch – YouTube comments just won’t load right, across Reddit Vanced, my phone, even Down Detector showed spikes. It’s a weird, unsettling feeling, isn’t it?
