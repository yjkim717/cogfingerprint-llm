>## Leveling Up: Why I Moved My Little Donation Store (and Learned a Lot)

Okay, so I did something a little different recently. I rebuilt the Constantiam donation store – yes, that little online shop that helps support PhantomCaptain – and moved it to a brand new website. Sounds small, right? But honestly, it’s been a surprisingly rewarding deep dive.

I've been dabbling in web design for a while, mostly just tinkering, but I really wanted to put my skills to the test. The old store was… functional. Let’s leave it at that. This was a chance to build something cleaner, more intuitive, and a genuine reflection of what I *could* do.

It wasn’t without its challenges, of course. CSS grid still occasionally throws me for a loop! But seeing the finished product, knowing it’s not just a functional tool but also a visual representation of effort and a way to directly contribute to PhantomCaptain's work… well, that feels pretty good. It’s a constant reminder that even small projects can be powerful learning experiences in this ever-evolving digital landscape.



Hope you like the new look!
