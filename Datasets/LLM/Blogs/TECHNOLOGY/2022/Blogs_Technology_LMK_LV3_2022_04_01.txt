As I scroll through my social media feed, I'm bombarded with videos of young people from my community "g-checking" each other - a UK drill-inspired trend where individuals confront strangers, often with aggressive language and posturing. It's a phenomenon that's both fascinating and disturbing. What strikes me is how this behavior has become normalized, with some even glorifying it as a form of street cred. But to me, it's just pathetic and embarrassing. It's a reflection of a deeper issue - a culture of violence and aggression that's seeping into our community norms. As we navigate the complexities of 2022, I'm left wondering: are we losing empathy and genuine human connection in the process? By perpetuating this culture online, are we creating a toxic environment that harms more than it inspires? It's time to rethink our online behaviors and the values we're promoting to the next generation.
