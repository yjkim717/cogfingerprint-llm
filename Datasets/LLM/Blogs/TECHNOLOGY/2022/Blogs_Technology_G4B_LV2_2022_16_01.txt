**The Ghosts in My Ledger**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How tech can feel both incredibly powerful and deeply frustrating at the same time? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a blockchain quirk – specifically, unstaking STETH on Lido and trying to get it back to good old ETH. 

The whole process felt like chasing ghosts in my ledger account. Curve’s protocol was supposed to make it seamless, but a misconfigured account threw a wrench in everything. It’s a stark reminder that even with the most sophisticated tools, a little human error can still cause a massive headache.  Anyone else had similar experiences this year?
