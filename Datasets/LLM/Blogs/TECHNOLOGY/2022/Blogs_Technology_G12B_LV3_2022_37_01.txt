>## The Weight of Legacy and the Quest for the Perfect Controller

It's funny how certain pieces of tech become so deeply intertwined with our gaming memories. I recently did something a little drastic – retired my trusty Xbox 360 controller. It’s been a loyal companion through countless late nights and epic gaming sessions, but its age was finally catching up. Now, I'm facing a fresh dilemma: DualSense or Xbox Series controller? 

The world of controllers has really evolved since those days. The sheer *features*! Adaptive triggers, haptic feedback… it’s almost overwhelming. I'm particularly curious about how well the PlayStation’s DualSense is supported in games on Steam. I’m a big *Dark Souls* fan, and proper controller prompts are crucial for navigating those treacherous worlds. 

And beyond that, I’m diving back into fighting games – *Tekken 7* has been calling my name.  Can the DualSense’s unique features actually translate to an advantage in a fighting game? Or is the Xbox Series controller’s more traditional layout the better bet for precision and responsiveness? 

It’s more than just picking a peripheral; it's about finding the next piece of hardware to build new memories around. Any recommendations from fellow gamers battling this same choice? Let me know in the comments!
