Remember that frantic, end-of-day feeling in 2022? My brain was fried from my engineering course, my commute was draining, and all I wanted was sleep. My academic performance was slipping because I had zero energy left to study.

My turning point was a simple piece of tech: a smart plug. I know, it sounds too basic. But I programmed it to kill power to my router and TV at 10 PM. That little forced digital sunset stopped my endless scrolling. The blue light vanished, and my mind finally got the quiet it desperately needed.

Prioritizing sleep didn't just give me more energy; it gave me back my focus. Sometimes, the most impactful technology isn't the one that does more, but the one that cleverly helps you do less. It was my small rebellion against burnout.
