The irony isn’t lost on me. In 2022, my phone’s sleep tracker started scolding me for my "inconsistent patterns" while I was crossing time zones. It was a relentless, chirpy little critic in my pocket. I was so focused on optimizing every hour, syncing my watch, and silencing notifications, that I forgot to just… rest. The data was perfect, but I was exhausted. It took a forced digital detox—a dead battery in a foreign train station—to finally look up and just breathe. The most advanced tech sometimes teaches us the simplest lessons.
