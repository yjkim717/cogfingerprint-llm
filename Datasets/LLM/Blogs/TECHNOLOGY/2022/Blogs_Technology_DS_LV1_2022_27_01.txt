You know, I’ve been thinking about how much my phone has become my "Balance" these days. In 2022, it’s like we’re all chasing digital amnesty—a clean slate from endless notifications and screen time guilt. I miss the simpler tech of my grad school days, just a laptop and maybe some ethersea of Wi-Fi. Now, every app demands attention, and I find myself longing for that old-school humor and connection, not this serious, always-on life. Maybe it’s time to unplug and find that equilibrium again.
