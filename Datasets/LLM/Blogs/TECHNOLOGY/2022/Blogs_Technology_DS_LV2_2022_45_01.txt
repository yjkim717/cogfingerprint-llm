It’s 2022, and I’ll admit it: I’m tired of my frontend feeling like a house of cards. Every new feature means juggling state, praying my UI updates don’t collapse some delicate logic I wrote months ago. I’ve been chasing this dream of a single source of truth, but it always felt just out of reach.

Lately, I’ve been wondering… what if the backend did more heavy lifting? What if it could handle the core business rules and just send my frontend clean, ready-to-use projections? The idea of the server pushing automated UI updates is incredibly seductive. It feels less like duct-taping two worlds together and more like they’re finally speaking the same language. Maybe the answer isn't more complexity up front, but smarter simplicity behind the scenes.
