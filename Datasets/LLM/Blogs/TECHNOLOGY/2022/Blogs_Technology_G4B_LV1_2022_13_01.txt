**Lost in the Ledger: My Francophone Stripe Struggle**

It’s weird, right? As a web developer in 2022, you’d think navigating payment gateways would be straightforward. But I recently found myself wrestling with invoicing a small French company – Siiret, to be exact – and the whole process felt…complicated. They needed specific documentation, and Stripe wasn’t quite cutting it.
