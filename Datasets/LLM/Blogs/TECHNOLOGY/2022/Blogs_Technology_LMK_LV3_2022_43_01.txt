As I dove into Go development in 2022, I realized the need for a utility library that could simplify slice and map operations. Leveraging Go's newly introduced generics, I created an open-source package to fill this gap. I'm excited to share it with the community and invite feedback and collaboration. By working together, we can build a more efficient and robust toolkit for Go developers, making our coding lives easier.
