**The Recharge Button and the Road Trip**

2022 felt like a year of trying to *do* everything – a whirlwind of travel across Europe with my son, who has Asperger’s. He thrives on activity, but his need for deep sleep is… intense.  I found myself constantly battling the urge to push him, to squeeze in another museum visit, while he just desperately needed rest. 

It made me think about our reliance on technology – the constant notifications, the pressure to stay connected.  Maybe we all need a digital “recharge button” sometimes, just like he does, to truly recover and find our energy again.  Anyone else feel this pull?
