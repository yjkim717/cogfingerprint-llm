**Is the Pay Really Worth It? My Tech Shift**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 felt like a year of chasing that bigger paycheck in tech. I jumped into a senior developer role with a salary that was *way* up there. And honestly? The hours were brutal. We were constantly putting out fires, and the pressure felt immense. 

I started wondering if it mirrored that old question: does more money automatically equal less sanity?  I saw it with friends too – the high-earners seemed perpetually stressed. It made me rethink my priorities. Maybe a slightly lower salary and a better work-life balance is a smarter investment, right? Food for thought, definitely.
