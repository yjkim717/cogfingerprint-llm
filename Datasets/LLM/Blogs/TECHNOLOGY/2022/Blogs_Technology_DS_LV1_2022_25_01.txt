**The Server That Cried Wolf: A 2022 Admin Story**

It was supposed to be routine. In my cozy home office, coffee in hand, I faced a task I’d done before: renewing the SSL certificate for our ADFS farm on Windows Server 2016. I ran the trusty `Set-AdfsSslCertificate` command with the new thumbprint, confident it would be a five-minute job.

Then, the error hit. The farm couldn't be detected. My heart sank. Was our entire identity provider infrastructure corrupted?

After a frantic search, the solution was almost comically simple. The command was like a person shouting into an empty room, getting no echo, and assuming the building had collapsed. All it needed was a direct address. By adding the `-ServerName` parameter to point it explicitly at one of our servers, it suddenly worked perfectly.

It was a stark 2022 reminder that even in a world of intelligent automation, sometimes technology just needs you to hold its hand and say, "Look, it’s right here." A small detail made all the difference between a crisis and a coffee break.
