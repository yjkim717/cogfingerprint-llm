### The Double Chip Dilemma

It all started with a simple trip to the vet. We’d just brought home our new puppy, Buster, a fluffy ball of energy we found through an online seller. The initial scan for a microchip beeped once. Then, to our surprise, it beeped a second time. Two chips.

My heart sank. A deeper investigation revealed Buster wasn’t a puppy at all, but a four-year-old dog. The second chip was still registered to his original family, who reported him stolen months ago.

In 2022, we trust technology to secure our lives, from digital payments to pet IDs. But this experience was a stark reminder that the system is only as honest as the people using it. We got our sweet Buster back to his rightful owners, but it left me reflecting on the unsettling gap between technological promise and human deception.
