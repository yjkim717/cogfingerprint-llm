## The Ghost of Data Past (and My Blockfolio Blues)

It's 2022, and we’re all supposed to trust the cloud, right? Yet, I'm staring at my phone, a knot of anxiety tightening in my stomach. My Blockfolio app, where I meticulously tracked my crypto investments, is acting up. Errors keep popping up, and the thought of losing all that manually entered data – months of purchase history, little notes about each trade – is genuinely unsettling.

It’s a stark reminder that even with all this fancy tech, there’s still a fragility to our digital lives. A glitch, a server hiccup… and suddenly, all your careful records could vanish. Makes you appreciate a good old-fashioned spreadsheet, doesn’t it?
