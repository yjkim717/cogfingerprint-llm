Of all the sounds that have come to define my life in 2022—the chime of a Slack notification, the robotic purr of my espresso machine, the endless scroll of a TikTok feed—none is more hauntingly human than the sound of my own breath.

It’s a sound I’d forgotten. But I rediscovered it this year, in the most unlikely of places: a small, rectangular box on my nightstand.

Let me rewind. For the last decade, my identity has been tangled up with being “connected.” As a tech writer, my job was to be first: first to the new gadget, first to the hot take, first to understand the next big thing. My phone was a phantom limb, my laptop a portal to a world of perpetual, frantic now. I was productive. I was informed. I was, by all the metrics our modern world values, successful.

And I was utterly, completely drained.

The breaking point wasn’t dramatic. There was no crashed server or deleted crypto wallet. It was a Tuesday. I was on my fifth video call of the day, my face a glowing square in a grid of other glowing squares. I was nodding, contributing, “leveraging synergies.” And in the middle of it all, I realized I had no idea what I had just agreed to. My brain, once a sharp tool, had become a browser with too many tabs open, each one frozen, spinning a little loading wheel into infinity.

That night, I lay in bed, my mind still buzzing with the day’s digital static. Sleep was a distant country. My Apple Watch smugly informed me my resting heart rate was elevated, as if I needed a machine to tell me I felt like crap. In a moment of desperation, I ordered something absurdly analog: a simple, screen-less meditation device that promised to guide your breathing with soft, pulsing light.

When it arrived, I was skeptical. It looked like a paperweight for a minimalist. But that first night, I turned off the lights, placed a finger on its smooth surface, and followed its gentle, luminous rhythm. Breathe in. Breathe out.

And that’s when I heard it. My breath. Not as a biological function, but as a sound. A low, soft whisper of air. In the profound quiet of my dark room, it was the only thing happening. For five minutes, there were no notifications. No headlines. No infinite feeds. There was just the simple, ancient act of filling my lungs and emptying them again.

It was the most profound piece of “technology” I’d interacted with all year, precisely because it asked me to interact with myself.

This small ritual sparked a quiet rebellion in me. I started carving out other screen-less spaces. I began leaving my phone in another room during meals. I bought a physical book—the kind with paper pages that smell like glue and possibility—and read for an hour before bed instead of doomscrolling. I even started taking walks without my headphones, forcing myself to listen to the world instead of a podcast about the world.

What I found in that silence wasn't emptiness. It was the space to think. Uninterrupted, linear thought became a novelty. An idea could start, develop, and conclude without being hijacked by a push notification for a flash sale on socks. I started having real "shower thoughts" again—
