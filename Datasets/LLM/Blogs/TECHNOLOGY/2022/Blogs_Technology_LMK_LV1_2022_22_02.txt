"The Perils of Poor Design: A Frustrating Tale of Broken Parts. I recently encountered a infuriating issue with a product that had a broken bolt - the screw was stuck and refused to budge. I tried using vice grips, a spring bush, and even brute force, but nothing worked. The product's failure was not just about the broken part, but the poor design that made it impossible to repair. In 2022, with all our technological advancements, it's astounding that such oversights still occur. It's a stark reminder that sometimes, technology can be more frustrating than helpful."
