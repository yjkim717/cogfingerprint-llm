It’s 2022, and I’m knee-deep in modding my tenth Skyrim playthrough. I installed Thaumaturgy for a fresh enchanting system, only to realize my favorite fire enchant was gone. I spent hours searching Nexus Mods, digging through forums, even trying risky console commands—nothing felt quite right. It hit me: in our rush to upgrade tech, we sometimes lose the simple magic of what worked before. Progress isn’t always a straight path forward.
