It’s 2022, and my tech salary just hit a new high—so why do I feel so drained? I scroll through job boards, eyeing roles with smaller numbers but maybe bigger smiles.

I used to think more money meant more success. Now, I’m clocking 60-hour weeks, answering Slack pings at midnight, and my hobbies are collecting digital dust. Is this the trade-off? A hefty paycheck for my peace of mind?

I’ve started wondering: what if “enough” isn’t a number, but a feeling? Maybe true satisfaction lies not in competing, but in crafting a life where work fuels joy instead of consuming it. Anyone else feeling this tug-of-war?
