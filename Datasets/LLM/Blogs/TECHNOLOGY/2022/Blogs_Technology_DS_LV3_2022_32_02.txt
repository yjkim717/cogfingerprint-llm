It was one of those heart-sinking IT moments in 2022 that every small business dreads. Picture this: our two sysadmins, the only ones with Active Directory keys, were both unexpectedly unavailable. A simple password change had spiraled, and suddenly, we were staring down a complete administrative lockout.

That cold-sweat realization hit hard—our entire digital kingdom was one accident away from being sealed shut. We couldn't rely on complex two-factor systems; we needed something simpler, yet ironclad. The solution? A dual-control emergency access protocol.

We split the "break glass" credentials, storing halves with trusted team members who would need to collaborate to gain entry. It wasn't just about password management; it was about building a system of checks and balances that reflected our collective responsibility. This approach didn’t just secure our network—it strengthened our team's trust, ensuring that no single point of failure could ever jeopardize our operations again. Sometimes, the simplest human collaborations create the most resilient safety nets.
