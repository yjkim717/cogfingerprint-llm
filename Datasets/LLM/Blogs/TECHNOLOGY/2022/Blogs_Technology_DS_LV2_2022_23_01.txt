It’s 2022, and I’m drowning in PDF textbooks. My digital notes are a chaotic mess, and I’m desperately searching for that one golden insight I highlighted in yellow weeks ago. Sound familiar?

I realized my note-taking app was letting me down. I didn’t just need to search text; I needed to search by the *feeling* I had when I highlighted it—urgency in red, key concepts in blue. Finding an app that could do this felt like discovering a secret weapon for my brain. It wasn't just about organization; it was about preserving my train of thought. Sometimes, the right tool doesn't just make you more efficient—it makes you feel understood.
