In 2022, I launched my sustainable clothing brand with high hopes, only to face a harsh reality: as a small, unknown name, our pricing was a barrier. That’s when I turned to technology, seeking a platform to sell at cost—not for profit, but for purpose. It was a humbling pivot, but it connected me directly with conscious consumers who valued the story behind the stitches, proving that sometimes, tech’s greatest gift is keeping passion alive when the market shifts.
