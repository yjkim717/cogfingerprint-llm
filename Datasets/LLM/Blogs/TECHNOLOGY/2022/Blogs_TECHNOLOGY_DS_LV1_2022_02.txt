### The Unlikely IT Apprentice

It’s funny how life circles back. In 2022, my ex-wife, now living in rural Ireland, called me. The request? “Can you help me get into IT?” With a tight budget and no local tech scene, the traditional path was a non-starter.

Our journey began not in a classroom, but with a single, affordable online course for an entry-level certification. I’d forgotten the thrill of those first “aha!” moments—the simple magic of configuring a virtual machine or understanding Active Directory for the first time. Guiding her through foundational concepts from 3,000 miles away, I wasn’t just a Windows Systems Engineer anymore; I was a remote mentor.

Her determination was the real engine. While the world debated the future of remote work, she was living its most empowering promise: that geography and circumstance don’t have to define your career. Watching her build a new future from her kitchen table didn't just help her—it rekindled my own passion for this ever-evolving field. Sometimes, the best way to remember why you love technology is to help someone else fall in love with it, too.
