### From Help Desk to Cloud: My Unlikely IT Journey

It’s 2022, and everyone seems to be talking about the cloud. It’s the promised land for so many breaking into tech. But if you’re staring at a blank screen, wondering how to even get your foot in the door, let me tell you a secret: my career didn’t start with complex code or futuristic architectures. It started with the simple, human problem of a printer that wouldn’t print.

That was my world on the help desk. For what felt like an eternity, I was the friendly (and sometimes frustrated) voice on the phone, walking people through rebooting routers and unlocking accounts. In hospitality, I soothed flustered hotel guests whose presentations wouldn’t load. In healthcare, I guided nurses through glitchy patient records software, where a frozen screen wasn’t just an inconvenience—it was a real-world problem. I wasn’t just fixing machines; I was solving human puzzles.

And that, I’ve realized after over twenty years in this wild industry, is the entire point. That help desk role wasn’t a dead end. It was my foundation. It taught me patience, how to talk to people who are stressed, and, most importantly, how to diagnose the *real* issue, not just the surface-level symptom.

When I finally began my climb into the cloud, I carried those lessons with me. Configuring a virtual server isn’t so different from troubleshooting that hotel printer. You’re still following a logical path, eliminating variables, and building something meant to serve a person on the other end.

So, if you’re new to this and feel daunted by the sheer scale of it all, don’t dismiss the starting line. Embrace the help desk. Get your hands dirty with the fundamentals. The cloud isn’t some abstract, magical realm—it’s just another tool to solve problems. And the best IT professionals, I’ve found, are the ones who never forget the human being waiting for the solution. Your journey has to start somewhere. Mine started with a "Paper Jam" error, and I wouldn't change a thing.
