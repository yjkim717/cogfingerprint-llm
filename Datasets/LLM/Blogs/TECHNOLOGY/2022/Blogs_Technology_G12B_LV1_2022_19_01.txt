>## The Algorithm and My Pottery

It's 2022, and we’re all swimming in a sea of curated perfection, aren't we? Scrolling through Instagram, I find myself increasingly drawn to accounts showcasing flawless pottery – perfectly symmetrical mugs, beautifully glazed bowls, the whole shebang. It's mesmerizing. And, if I’m honest, a little disheartening.

I’ve been trying to get into pottery for a few months now, and my creations look… less than perfect. Lopsided, uneven, sometimes downright wonky. The little voice in my head whispers, "You'll never be that good," echoing the countless flawlessly crafted pieces I’ve seen online.

It's a strange feeling, this digital comparison. It’s like wanting to compete with an algorithm, a perfected version of artistry. I realized I was chasing an ideal, not enjoying the process. The clay is messy, the learning curve is steep, and that's okay. Maybe the goal isn’t to become a pottery pro, but to simply *make*. To feel the clay between my fingers and create something, however imperfect, that's genuinely mine. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough.
