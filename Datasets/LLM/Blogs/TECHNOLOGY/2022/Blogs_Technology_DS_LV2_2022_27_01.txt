You know, I never thought I’d miss the simple joy of a flip phone. In 2022, my smartphone is a marvel—it can do everything but help me breathe. I catch myself scrolling endlessly, chasing notifications like digital fireflies, only to feel emptier afterward.

So last week, I left it at home and walked through the park. I heard birds, not pings. I saw faces, not screens. Maybe balance isn’t about disconnecting forever, but remembering what it feels like to be truly present.
