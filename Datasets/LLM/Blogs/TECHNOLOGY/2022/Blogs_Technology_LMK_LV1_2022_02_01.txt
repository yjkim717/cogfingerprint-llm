"I still can't believe I upgraded to the iPhone 13 and lost a feature I loved - voicemail transcripts! With my old iPhone, I could read a summary of my voicemails, but now I'm stuck listening to each one. I've checked with Verizon, and apparently, it's not a network issue. I'm not alone, as others have reported the same problem. It's frustrating to lose functionality, especially when it's a feature I relied on daily. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm starting to think it's time to go back to my old iPhone or explore other carriers."
