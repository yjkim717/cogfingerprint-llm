"As I scrolled through YouTube on my 2022 device, I noticed a frustrating issue - comments weren't loading. I wasn't alone; others reported the same glitch on Vanced, NewPipe, and even the stock app. It got me thinking: is it a server-side issue or an app problem? The fact that multiple platforms were affected suggested the issue lay with YouTube itself. It's a reminder that even with great tech, sometimes the problem lies beyond our control."
