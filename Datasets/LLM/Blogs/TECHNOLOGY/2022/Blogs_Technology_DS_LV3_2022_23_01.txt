Remember those frantic late-night study sessions in 2022, flipping through digital PDF textbooks while drowning in highlighted text? I’d color-code everything—yellow for key concepts, pink for definitions—but finding specific notes later felt like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Then I discovered text recognition that actually understood my highlighter system. Suddenly, searching by color transformed my workflow. It wasn't just about technology keeping up with my methods; it was about finally having a digital tool that respected how my brain naturally organized information. The right features don't just add convenience—they bring peace of mind.
