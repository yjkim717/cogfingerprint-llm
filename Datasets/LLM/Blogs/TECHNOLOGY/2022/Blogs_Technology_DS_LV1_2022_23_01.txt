It’s 2022, and I’m deep in my semester, surrounded by digital clutter. I’ve got PDF textbooks and scanned articles everywhere, each filled with my rainbow of highlights—yellow for key terms, blue for examples, pink for questions. But finding that one pink highlight later? Nearly impossible.

I started dreaming of a note-taking app that didn’t just store my notes but truly understood them. Imagine typing “show all blue highlights from Chapter 4” and watching them appear instantly. It’s not just about convenience—it’s about creating a seamless bridge between my thoughts and my tools, turning chaotic study sessions into organized, productive ones. In a world of endless information, the right tech can bring a little peace to the process.
