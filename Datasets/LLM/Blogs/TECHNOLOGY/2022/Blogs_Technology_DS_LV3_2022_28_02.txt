It’s 2022, and I’ll admit—I almost skipped Tower of Dawn. Chaol wasn’t my favorite, and diving into his story felt like a detour. But wow, was I wrong.

Reading it reminded me of learning to code in a language I thought I didn’t need. At first, it felt slow, even tedious. But just like how understanding the architecture of a system—the worldbuilding—can transform how you build apps, Chaol’s journey reshaped how I saw the entire series. His growth, his struggles… they weren’t just filler. They were foundational.

In tech, we sometimes chase the shiny new thing and overlook the essential, unglamorous work that holds everything together. Tower of Dawn was that for me: a lesson in depth over speed, in character over convenience. Sometimes the parts we resist the most are the ones that change us.
