"Renewing ADFS Certificates: A Lesson in Troubleshooting"

In 2022, managing Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is still a critical task for many IT professionals. I recently encountered a frustrating issue while renewing our ADFS certificate on a Windows Server 2016 farm. The error message 'AD FS could not detect other machines joined to this farm' was puzzling, to say the least. After some digging, I discovered that the issue was related to the `Set-AdfsSslCertificate` cmdlet not updating the certificate thumbprint correctly across all farm members. To resolve this, I had to manually update the thumbprint on each node and reconfigure the ADFS service. This experience taught me the importance of double-checking configuration and thoroughly testing changes in a farm environment. If you're facing similar issues, I hope my story saves you some troubleshooting time!
