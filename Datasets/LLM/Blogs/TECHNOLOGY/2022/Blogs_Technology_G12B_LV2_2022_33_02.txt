## The Comment Section Mystery (And Why I Miss Vanced)

Anyone else notice YouTube comments just… vanished? It’s been weird this week. I've seen reports across the board – official app, NewPipe, even folks using Vanced (RIP, my friend!). Seems like YouTube themselves are having a hiccup. 

It’s a small thing, but it highlights how much we rely on these platforms. And honestly, it makes me miss the ad-free bliss of Vanced even more. Technology’s always changing, isn't it?
