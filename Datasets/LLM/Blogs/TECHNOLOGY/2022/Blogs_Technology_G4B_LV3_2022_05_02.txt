**The Sausage Roll and the Silence**

It’s weird, isn't it? After a whirlwind two years spent navigating the muted world of Japan – masks, social distancing, a constant hum of digital connection – stepping back into Melbourne felt… unsettling.  I’d been craving the familiar chaos, the laneway cafes, the sheer *noise* of the city. But the quiet, the almost unsettling lack of ubiquitous tech, hit me harder than I expected. 

I’m a digital native, glued to my phone, constantly scanning for notifications. Japan forced a different rhythm; a slower, more deliberate way of being. Coming home, I felt a strange disconnect.  It wasn’t a bad thing, exactly, but a definite adjustment. 

I found myself craving the little digital comforts – the instant translation, the seamless online ordering.  Then, I grabbed a sausage roll from a local bakery (a serious Melbourne ritual, you know!), and the world just… stopped.  It was a reminder that sometimes, the best connections aren’t found on a screen.  Anyone else feeling a bit of reverse culture shock lately?
