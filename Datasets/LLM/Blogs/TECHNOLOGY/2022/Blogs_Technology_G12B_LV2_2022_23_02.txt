## The Little Button That Made Me Think

It's funny, the things that spark a bigger thought. I was chatting with a developer friend the other day about a new feature they were building – an online ordering system. They were wrestling with a tiny detail: what to call the button for orders that needed a little extra customer check-in before they could be finalized? 

“We want to avoid anything that sounds…negative,” they explained. “'Reject' feels harsh. 'Error' is confusing.”

And it hit me. We put so much effort into sleek interfaces and intuitive design, but sometimes it’s the small labels, the seemingly insignificant words, that truly shape the user experience. It’s a reminder that even in the age of automation, human connection – and *how* we communicate – still matters immensely.  It got me thinking about how carefully we choose our words in *all* digital interactions, doesn’t it?  It’s more than just functionality; it’s about feeling understood.
