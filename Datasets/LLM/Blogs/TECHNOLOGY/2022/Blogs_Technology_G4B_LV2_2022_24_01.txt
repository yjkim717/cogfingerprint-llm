**The Emoji Barrier**

It’s funny how tech, meant to connect us, sometimes feels like a barrier. Last year, I was trying to describe a complex design brief to my team – a really specific, layered hairstyle I’d been admiring. I started sending a string of emojis: a messy bun, a sharp bob, a textured wave. It was… chaotic. 

My colleague just stared back, utterly bewildered. We ended up spending ten minutes clarifying, laughing about the emoji overload. It made me realize how much nuance gets lost when we rely solely on digital shortcuts. Maybe sometimes, a real conversation – and a good old-fashioned explanation – is the best tech of all.
