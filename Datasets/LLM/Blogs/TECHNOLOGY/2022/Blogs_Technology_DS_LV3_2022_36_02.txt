It’s 2022, and my Firefox has declared war on YouTube. I’ve tried everything—disabling every extension, clearing all my data, even a full reinstall. The troubleshooting rabbit hole is real. Every other site loads perfectly, but YouTube? A blank, stubborn tab. It’s a strange digital ghost town in my own browser. You start to wonder if it’s a sign to finally step away from the endless scroll, a glitch forcing a moment of clarity in our hyper-connected world.
