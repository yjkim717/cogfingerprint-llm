## The Digital Playground and Parental Boundaries

It's 2022, and my kid's world increasingly exists within Minecraft. It's amazing to see their creativity flourish in those blocky landscapes, especially in creative mode worlds. But navigating the online friend aspect? That's a whole different level. Recently, we had a situation where my child had accumulated a few… let's just say *unwelcome* online friends. 

The tricky part? We share a household with siblings who also play. Blocking everyone felt excessive. It sparked a bigger conversation about digital boundaries, online safety, and teaching kids how to manage their digital relationships – a lesson we’re all learning together, one pixelated block at a time.
