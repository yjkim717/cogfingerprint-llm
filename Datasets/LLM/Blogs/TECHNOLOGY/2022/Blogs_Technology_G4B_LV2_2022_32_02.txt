**The Panic Button for Our Server**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How reliant we’ve become on technology, and how utterly terrifying it can be when things go sideways. Last year, we hit a snag at [Business Name] – a classic Active Directory lockout. One of our admins got stuck, and suddenly, no one could make critical changes.
