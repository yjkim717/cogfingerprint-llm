**The Urgent Button and Me**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 felt like a constant sprint. As an IT professional, I was *always* on, fixing, building, responding. It was exhilarating, sure, but also… exhausting. And fueled by a terrible habit: impulsivity. I’d dive headfirst into a project, ignoring the little voice saying, “Pause, think!” 

I’m pretty good at what I do, and people generally like working with me, but beneath the surface, I was just bouncing from one urgent task to the next.  It wasn’t sustainable.  Recently, I started talking to a therapist about it – really digging into why I react so strongly to the “urgent” button. Turns out, it’s linked to a lack of self-awareness.  It’s a weird, humbling realization, but a necessary one.  Wish me luck as I learn to slow down!
