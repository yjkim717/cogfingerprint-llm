## The Echo Chamber and Me

It's 2022, and I feel like I’m living inside a perfectly curated bubble. Sounds dramatic, I know, but think about it. Algorithms know what I like *before* I do. My feeds are filled with things that confirm what I already believe. It’s… comfortable. Too comfortable, maybe?

I remember a time when stumbling across something completely unexpected was a regular occurrence. Now, it feels rare. I actively have to *seek out* viewpoints different from mine.  It's not that the internet is inherently bad, it's just… efficient. Efficient at reinforcing, not challenging.

The other day, I realised I hadn't genuinely shifted my perspective on a topic in months. It was a little unsettling.  So, I’ve started making a conscious effort to follow accounts that push me, read articles I’d usually scroll past. It's harder work, definitely, but the feeling of expanding my understanding? Worth every click.  Anyone else feeling this? Let me know in the comments!

Hopefully, that hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
