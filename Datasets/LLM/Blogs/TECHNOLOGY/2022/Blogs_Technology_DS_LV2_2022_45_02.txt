Staring at another late-night coding session in 2022, I felt that familiar frustration—manually piecing together WASM IR with strings felt like building a house of cards. Then I discovered Rust’s pest.rs and a DSL approach. Suddenly, opcodes became structured, safe expressions. It wasn’t just about efficiency; it was about crafting with clarity. Sometimes, the right tool doesn’t just solve a problem—it transforms your entire workflow.
