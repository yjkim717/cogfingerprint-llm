**The Silent Swipe: When Tech Makes You Close Off**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 felt… complicated, right? We were all glued to our phones, building curated online lives, and desperately trying to keep up with the constant stream of notifications. And for me, it triggered something really uncomfortable. 

It started with my sister. She was genuinely trying to help me with a massive career pivot – a scary leap into freelance design. She'd send articles, offer video calls, even just a simple “Thinking of you!” text. But I started to *defend* myself, pushing back on her suggestions, almost bristling at her kindness. 

It took me a while to realize I was mirroring a pattern from my past. A past where vulnerability felt like weakness, where needing help meant admitting I couldn’t handle things alone.  Suddenly, even my sister's well-intentioned offers felt like a challenge to my carefully constructed independence.

I started analyzing every interaction through the lens of my phone – the instant replies, the carefully worded responses designed to maintain control.  It was exhausting.  I realized the digital world, with its emphasis on instant connection and perceived perfection, was amplifying an old anxiety I’d been trying to bury. 

It’s a weird thing, isn’t it?  We build these digital walls, thinking we’re protecting ourselves, but sometimes they just end up pushing people away.  Maybe the next time someone offers a little help, I’ll just… swipe right on acceptance.
