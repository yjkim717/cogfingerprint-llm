The glow of my laptop screen illuminated the late-night coffee stains on my desk—a familiar sight in 2022, the year my sister graduated into a world reshaped by technology. As she weighed self-employment against traditional paths, I found myself diving into digital rabbit holes, researching everything from health insurance algorithms to automated child benefit applications.

I remember watching her set up her first freelance profile, her internship experience now a digital portfolio. The internet promised freedom, but each click came with questions: How would she navigate taxes as a solo entrepreneur? Could an app really simplify health coverage for an independent worker?

Technology had given her the tools to build something entirely her own, yet it also demanded a new kind of literacy—one that blended ambition with caution. It wasn’t just about building a business; it was about learning to trust digital systems with her stability.

In the quiet of those research-filled nights, I realized that her journey wasn’t just hers alone. It was a reflection of a generation learning to balance dreams with dropdown menus, turning uncertainty into opportunity, one logged-in step at a time.
