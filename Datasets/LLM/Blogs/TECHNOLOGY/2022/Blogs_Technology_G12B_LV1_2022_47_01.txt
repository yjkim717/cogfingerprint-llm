## The Bug in My Brain (and My Code)

It's late 2022, and I'm staring at a screen full of hastily-written code. Again. You know that feeling? That frantic push to *finish* something, *anything*, before the deadline, even if you suspect it’s… not quite right? I've been battling it a lot lately.

I’m an IT professional, and for a while, I genuinely thought being productive meant churning out as much as possible. Quantity over quality. Ship it, fix it later, right? It felt like the modern tech ethos. But the “fix it later” part has been piling up, a mountain of little regrets and bug fixes that eat into my already limited time.

Honestly, it’s more than just work. I notice this impulsivity bleeding into other areas of my life – quick decisions I later question, commitments I make and then struggle to keep. It’s exhausting.

Recently, I realized this isn't just about being a bad coder. It’s a pattern, a tendency. It’s been making me anxious, and frankly, impacting my mental health. I'm starting to seriously consider talking to someone, maybe even getting a referral. There’s a growing awareness in the tech community about burnout and mental wellbeing, and I’m finally ready to admit I need some support.

Maybe slowing down, focusing on deliberate work instead of just *doing*, is the real productivity hack. It's a scary thought, challenging a habit ingrained over years, but I think it’s a bug worth squashing.



Hope this is what you were looking for! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
