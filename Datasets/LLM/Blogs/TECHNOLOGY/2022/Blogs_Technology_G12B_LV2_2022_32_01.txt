## Deja Vu in the Domain: When Your Exchange Server Throws You a Curveball

Okay, so, anyone else feel like 2022 has been a *year*? Between supply chain woes and the ever-shifting tech landscape, I’ve definitely had my share of head-scratchers. Just last week, I was wrestling with one that felt particularly bizarre. We were migrating an Exchange server, everything *seemed* to be going smoothly, and then…boom. Duplicate domain options popping up during login. 

Seriously, it was like the server was experiencing a memory glitch. My immediate thought? Something funky had happened with ADSI modifications. It’s that weird corner of Active Directory that feels like it’s powered by magic and crossed fingers.

Spent a good chunk of Friday tracing it back, feeling like I was following breadcrumbs in a digital forest. Turns out, a previous script had left a lingering echo. A small fix, but a surprisingly frustrating detour. It’s a good reminder that even meticulously planned migrations can throw you a curveball. Anyone else had similar AD experiences? Let's commiserate in the comments!

**Potential Image Ideas:**

*   A slightly blurred, zoomed-in screenshot of a login screen with duplicate domain options highlighted.
*   A photo of someone looking thoughtfully at a computer screen, perhaps with a slightly exasperated expression.



Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further development of this!
