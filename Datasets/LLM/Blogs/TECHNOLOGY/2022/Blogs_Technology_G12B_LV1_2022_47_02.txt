>## The Sysadmin Gauntlet: Was That Interview *Really* Necessary?

Okay, so I just finished interviewing for a sysadmin role, and wow. Two and a half to four hours? Five different interviewers? For a *first* sysadmin position? My brain is still processing. 

It got me thinking about the modern hiring process in tech. Are we overdoing it? I get the need to find the right fit, but spending that much time grilling someone feelsâ€¦intense. Back in the day, a handshake and a whiteboard challenge felt more streamlined. 

Maybe it's just the market in 2022, with everyone scrambling for talent. Still, I hope companies remember that a good interview should be a conversation, not an interrogation.
