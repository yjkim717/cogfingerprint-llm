>## The Endless Scroll and the Echo of "Good Enough"

It's 2022, and I feel like we're all living under a constant spotlight. Social media, online portfolios, even just browsing LinkedIn – it’s a highlight reel of everyone else's successes. Lately, I've been wrestling with a familiar feeling: the urge to compare.

It’s like when I first started learning to code. I'd see these incredibly polished websites, beautifully designed apps, and think, "Why can't *I* do that?" The pressure to measure up, to prove I wasn’t wasting my time, was intense. It fuelled a frantic coding pace, but also a deep dissatisfaction. 

I started wondering, is anything truly "good enough" anymore? Is the constant exposure to others' achievements paralyzing us, preventing us from enjoying the process of learning and creating? I’m trying to shift my focus – celebrating small wins, acknowledging progress, and remembering that behind every polished profile is a whole lot of trial and error. Maybe "good enough" *is* enough, especially when you're still learning.
