That first email from a client in France felt like unlocking a new level in my career. But the victory dance was short-lived. Suddenly, I wasn't just a Canadian web developer; I was an international business owner, staring down a wall of foreign terms: SIRET numbers, international wire fees, and business accounts.

My simple sole proprietorship, perfect for local gigs, suddenly felt small. The dream of a borderless digital world bumped right into the very real, very bureaucratic structures of international commerce. It was a stark 2022 reminder that while code can travel anywhere instantly, people and payments still have to navigate the messy, paper-filled real world. It forced me to grow up, from a coder to a business, almost overnight.
