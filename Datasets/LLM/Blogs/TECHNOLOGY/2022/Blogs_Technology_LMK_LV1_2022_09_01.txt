As I played the latest FPS games in 2022, I couldn't help but wonder: why do characters stop being a threat the moment they die? Implementing "posthumous damage" - where a dying character's shotgun blast still damages the player - could make gameplay more forgiving. It would allow for more realistic and nuanced game design, where a player's mistake doesn't instantly become a game-over.
