"Lost in Scrolls: The Anxiety of Delayed Connections in a Hyper-Connected World"

As I sat with my phone in 2022, waiting for a specialist appointment regarding my worsening neurological symptoms, including headaches and tingling that had me concerned about hydrocephalus, I couldn't help but reflect on the paradox of our modern world. We're more connected than ever, yet the anxiety of waiting for a simple appointment or response can be overwhelming. I found myself mindlessly scrolling through social media, comparing my medical journey to others, and worrying about the potential risks associated with my condition. The constant ping of notifications only added to my unease. In that moment, I realized that technology, while a powerful tool, can also exacerbate our anxieties. As we navigate the complexities of brain health and medical concerns, it's essential to acknowledge the impact of technology on our mental well-being and strive for a healthier balance.
