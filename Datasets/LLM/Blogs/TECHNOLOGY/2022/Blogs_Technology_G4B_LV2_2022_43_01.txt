**The Quiet Thrill of Open Source Helpers**

It’s funny, isn’t it?  2022 felt like a year of big, splashy tech announcements. But sometimes, the most rewarding moments are the quiet ones. I stumbled across a new Go package – generic helpers for slices and maps – and it just…clicked. 

It reminded me of why I fell for Go in the first place: the spirit of collaboration and sharing. This developer, completely open source, built something genuinely useful. It’s a tiny piece of code, but it felt like a little reminder that even small contributions can make a difference.  What’s your favorite unexpected tech find lately?
