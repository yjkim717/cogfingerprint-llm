"As we dive into 2022, I'm still amazed by how our understanding of proteins has evolved. We know genes code for proteins, but it's not a direct translation. Intron-exon structures add complexity, and post-translational modifications can alter protein function. I've been exploring how proteomics is revolutionizing our grasp on gene-protein relations. It's clear that there's more to the story than just the genetic code. The more we learn, the more we realize the intricate dance between genes, proteins, and the proteome."
