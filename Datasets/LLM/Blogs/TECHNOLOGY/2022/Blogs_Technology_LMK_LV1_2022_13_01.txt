"Getting Paid in Euros: A Canadian Developer's Dilemma"

As a Canadian web developer, I recently landed a contract with a French company, and I was thrilled. However, my excitement was short-lived as I hit a roadblock - invoicing them and receiving euro payments. The catch? I don't have a SIRET number, a mandatory registration for businesses in France. I scoured the web for answers, but the info sec (information security) measures and regulations surrounding euro transactions had me stumped. How could I securely receive payments without this crucial identifier? After some digging, I discovered a few workarounds that allowed me to get paid without a SIRET. If you're a Canadian business facing a similar challenge, you're not alone. In this post, I'll share my findings and the solutions I implemented to successfully invoice my French client and receive euros - no SIRET required.
