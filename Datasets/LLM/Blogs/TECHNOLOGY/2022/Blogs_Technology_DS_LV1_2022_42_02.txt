### My Quest for the Ultimate Zero-Carb Potato Swap

After years on a keto journey, my biggest hurdle remains: finding a satisfying substitute for fluffy mashed potatoes or a bed of rice. I’ve ventured down the shirataki path—those translucent noodles are a zero-carb marvel, but their unique texture and aroma can be an acquired taste. My kitchen has become a lab for other experiments. I’m exploring everything from finely diced cauliflower roasted until crispy to using heart of palm as a stand-in for potato salad.

### The Unplanned Digital Detox

It was 2022, and a rogue update bricked my laptop. For 48 hours, my primary screen was the world outside my window. At first, the silence was deafening—no pings, no endless scroll. I felt untethered. But then, something shifted. I read a physical book, its pages a tactile joy. I had a long, meandering conversation with a neighbor without glancing at my phone once. When my laptop was restored, I didn't rush back to my old habits. That forced disconnect was a gift. It reminded me that the most refreshing updates aren't for our devices, but for our own minds. I now schedule a "tech sabbath" every month. My creativity has never been better.
