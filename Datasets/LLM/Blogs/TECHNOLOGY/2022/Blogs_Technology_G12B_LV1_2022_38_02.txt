>## The Unexpected Comfort of Paper Tickets

Remember the frantic scramble at airport security? Digging through your bag for that digital boarding pass, praying the barcode scanned, battling a glitchy phone battery? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? 

This year, while planning a trip, a bizarre thing happened. I deliberately printed my boarding pass. Actual, physical paper. And honestly? It was…relaxing. 

There's something comforting about holding a tangible piece of information in a world obsessed with digital everything. No battery anxiety, no frantic app updates, just a simple piece of paper confirming my flight. It felt oddly reassuring, a small rebellion against the constant connectivity. Maybe we've gotten a little *too* reliant on technology. Sometimes, a little analog simplicity is exactly what we need.
