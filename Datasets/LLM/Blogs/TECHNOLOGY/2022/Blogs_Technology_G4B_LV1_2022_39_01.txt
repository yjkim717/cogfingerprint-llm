**Pixels & Proof: Feeling a Little Weird About NFTs**

Okay, 2022 was… a year for NFTs, right? I spent a lot of time staring at weird pixelated apes and wondering if I was missing something. Then I stumbled across this idea – eNftMemes. Minting your silly memes as NFTs and earning crypto through voting and auctions? It’s strangely compelling. 

It feels like we’re layering a whole new layer of value onto things that were already inherently silly.  Part of me thinks it’s a total bubble, but another part – a small, slightly bewildered part – is fascinated by the idea of turning internet humor into a digital collectible.  Maybe there’s something to this weird intersection of tech and nostalgia after all.
