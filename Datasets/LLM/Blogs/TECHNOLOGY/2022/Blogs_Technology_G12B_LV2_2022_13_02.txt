## The Digital Ghost of Transactions Past

It's wild how reliant we've become on apps, isn't it? Just last week, I was wrestling with Blockfolio, desperately trying to recover some manually entered crypto tracking data after an app hiccup wiped my purchase history. Talk about a frustrating reminder of how fragile our digital records can be! 

It made me pause and think â€“ how much of our lives are truly *backed up* outside of these platforms? It's a bit unsettling, really. A good nudge to be a little more diligent about keeping offline records, even in this increasingly digital age. Anyone else felt this lately?



I hope this captures the tone and style you were looking for! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
