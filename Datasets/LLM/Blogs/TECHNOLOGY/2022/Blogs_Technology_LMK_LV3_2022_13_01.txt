As a Canadian freelancer in 2022, I navigated the complexities of receiving cross-border payments from a French e-commerce client. The experience was eye-opening - from understanding taxation implications to crafting a compliant receipt. It made me realize that in today's digital landscape, technology has simplified global transactions, but also introduced new challenges. By embracing these complexities, I've not only streamlined my workflow but also gained a deeper understanding of the intricacies of international freelance work.
