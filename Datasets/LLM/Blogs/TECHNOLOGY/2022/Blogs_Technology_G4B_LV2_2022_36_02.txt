**The Day Firefox Just… Wouldn’t.**

Okay, confession time: I’m a *huge* YouTube watcher. It’s my go-to for everything – tutorials, silly cat videos, you name it. So, when Firefox just flat-out refused to load YouTube last week, it felt like a personal affront. I spent a solid hour troubleshooting, restarting, the whole nine yards. 

Turns out, a rogue extension was the culprit. After a frustrating reinstall, it was back to normal. It’s a small thing, sure, but it really highlighted how reliant we’ve become on these digital tools – and how easily they can throw a wrench in our day.  Anyone else have a tech hiccup lately that felt *really* inconvenient?
