**Leveling Up My Rig: A Mid-Life Motherboard Upgrade**

Okay, so 2022 was the year I finally tackled a project I’d been putting off – upgrading my PC. It wasn’t a complete overhaul, more like a strategic boost. My ASRock H470 motherboard was feeling a little…tired, and I was determined to squeeze more performance out of my RTX 2070 Super. 

I decided to go for an i5 processor, hoping to alleviate some of the bottlenecks I was experiencing.  Turns out, it made a *huge* difference!  I even started experimenting with higher memory speeds – pushing my RAM to its limits.  It’s a surprisingly satisfying process, seeing those incremental gains.  It reminded me that sometimes, a targeted upgrade can breathe new life into older hardware, and that’s a pretty cool feeling.
