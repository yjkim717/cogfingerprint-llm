**Remembering the Wild West of the Web**

It feels strange to think about how quickly things change, doesn't it? I was just scrolling through old forums – remnants of a time called “TAZ,” a community that used to be *pure* chaos and creativity. It felt like a grad student’s playground for digital experimentation. Now, it’s… calmer. 

Like Ethersea, it’s shifted. I miss the wild, hopeful energy, the feeling that anything was possible.  It makes me wonder about the balance we’re striving for – safety versus freedom, connection versus isolation.  Maybe we need a little more of that original “taz” spirit.
