## So, You Want to Break Into IT? Let Me Tell You a Story… (and Share a Few Things I Wish I Knew)

It's 2022, and the tech world feels…massive, doesn’t it? When I started my IT journey, it felt like a distant, almost mythical land. I remember staring at job postings, feeling completely overwhelmed. "Five years experience required?" Seriously? How am I supposed to *get* five years experience if nobody will give me a chance?

Looking back, I realize the biggest hurdle wasn't the technical skills (though those are important!), but the *approach*. I spent so much time chasing certifications, thinking that would be the magic ticket. It helped, sure, but it wasn’t the whole picture. 

What *really* opened doors was getting my hands dirty. Volunteering to help friends with their computer issues, building a (very basic!) website, even just messing around with Linux in a virtual machine. Practical experience, even small-scale, speaks volumes.

And honestly? Don't be afraid to ask for feedback. Seriously. I was terrified of sounding stupid, but the people I reached out to – mentors, colleagues – were overwhelmingly willing to help. Their insights were invaluable. 

If you’re eyeing an IT career, remember this: it's a journey, not a destination. Focus on building a foundation of practical skills, embrace the learning process, and don't be afraid to ask for guidance. You’ve got this.
