**Dusting Off the Past: My Unexpected Pod XT Revival**

Okay, confession time. I’ve been wrestling with a bit of a nostalgic tech project this year. I finally got my hands on an old Pod XT – a beast from the early 2000s – and I was determined to get it working on my current computer.  Let me tell you, the compatibility headaches were *real*. 

It quickly became clear that the drivers just weren’t playing nice. So, after a few late nights, I ended up building a Windows 10 virtual machine. Seriously, it felt a little like time travel! Running the Pod XT inside that VM was a surprisingly smooth experience. 

It’s a weird feeling, bringing a piece of older tech back to life in this way.  It reminded me how much things change, and how sometimes, a little bit of creative workaround is all you need to reconnect with the tools that shaped your sound – and maybe a little bit of your past.
