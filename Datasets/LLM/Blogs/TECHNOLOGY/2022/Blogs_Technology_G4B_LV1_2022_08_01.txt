**Lost in Time (and Sleep)**

Okay, confession time: my recent trip to Europe felt…weird. I’d meticulously planned everything, tracking every flight change with my Apple Watch, trying to optimize for minimal jet lag. But I was *exhausted*. Like, bone-deep tired.  I’ve got Asperger’s, and the sensory overload of new places always hits hard, but this was different. 

It made me think about how reliant we are on tech to manage travel – tracking, scheduling, even monitoring our sleep. Maybe sometimes, disconnecting and just *feeling* the shift in time zones is the best approach?  It’s definitely something to consider.
