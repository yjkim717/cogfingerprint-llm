**Locking Down the Locals: A Little Security Lesson**

It’s weird how quickly “urgent” IT tasks become routine, isn’t it? Back in 2022, I was wrestling with a particularly annoying vulnerability scan in a Windows 10 domain. We were seeing repeated attempts to access accounts – specifically, local administrator accounts – and it was a huge red flag. 

I remembered a blog post I’d read about using Group Policy to restrict network access for these accounts. Honestly, it felt a bit like a band-aid, but it was a *good* band-aid. Implementing it was surprisingly straightforward – a few clicks in Active Directory, and boom – those accounts were effectively cut off from the wider network. 

It really drove home the point that even seemingly small steps, like limiting access for privileged accounts, can make a massive difference in bolstering overall security. It’s not about building impenetrable walls, but about layering up those defenses, one local administrator at a time.  What security quirks have you tackled recently?
