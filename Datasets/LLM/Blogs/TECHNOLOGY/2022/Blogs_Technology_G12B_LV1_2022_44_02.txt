## My Laptop & The Slow Fade of "Normal"

Remember 2019? Business trips meant stiff suits, frantic taxis, and crumpled receipts. Now? My laptop’s practically a second home. It's wild how quickly we adapted. Last week, I finalized a deal with a client in Singapore, all without leaving my kitchen table. 

Part of me misses the energy of those in-person meetings, the spontaneous coffee chats. But honestly, the efficiency (and the cash back I’m racking up on my travel credit card for those occasional essential flights!) is hard to argue with. It feels like 'normal' has shifted, and it's not quite the same as we remember.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
