**The Global Payment Puzzle**

It’s weird how quickly the digital world shrinks, isn’t it? I was chatting with a friend last year – 2022, remember? – who’s building a website for a French company. They needed help setting up invoicing, and suddenly, a whole tangle of questions popped up. 

They were grappling with international payments, specifically looking at options like Wise and Stripe, and realizing the hurdle of needing a French SIRET number. It made me think about the frustrating gaps in our tech – how easily we assume everyone has access to the same tools and knowledge. 

It’s a reminder that building truly global solutions requires more than just clever code; it demands understanding the nuances of different markets and regulations.  Anyone else hit similar roadblocks when expanding online?
