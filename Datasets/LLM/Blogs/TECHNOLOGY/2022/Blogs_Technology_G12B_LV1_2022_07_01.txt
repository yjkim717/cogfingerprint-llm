>## The Unexpected Cost of Doing Good (Online)

It's funny how things shift, isn’t it? Just last year, I was riding high, launching my small brand of sustainable underwear. Ethically sourced materials, fair labor – the whole shebang. People *wanted* to feel good about their purchases. But 2022 threw a curveball. Suddenly, everyone’s tightening their belts, and that extra cost for eco-friendly options? It’s a tough sell.

I’m wrestling with what to do. My online shop is barely breaking even, and I'm considering a significant price drop – even selling at cost – just to move inventory. It's a digital dilemma: how do you balance values with the realities of a fluctuating market? It makes you wonder about the long game of conscious consumerism.
