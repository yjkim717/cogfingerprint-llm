As I prepared for my 2022 trip to Colombia with Spirit Airlines, I wondered if a digital copy of my vaccination card would be accepted. With the rise of digital documentation, it's becoming increasingly common to ditch the physical papers. Thankfully, Colombia was embracing this tech-savvy trend, accepting digital vaccination records. This small convenience made a big difference, allowing me to travel more efficiently and focus on enjoying my journey.
