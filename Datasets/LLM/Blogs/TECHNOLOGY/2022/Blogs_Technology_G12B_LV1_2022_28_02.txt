## The Algorithm’s Slow Burn: Why Patience Pays Off Online

Remember when everyone was obsessed with instant gratification? TikTok, fleeting trends, the constant scroll? 2022 felt like the peak of that. But lately, I’ve been thinking about how valuable the "slow burn" can be online, and it oddly reminded me of reading *Tower of Dawn* (don't worry, no spoilers!).

That book was divisive – a lot of people wanted more action, felt it was a detour. But sticking with it revealed incredible depth in the world and with its characters.  It felt like a necessary pause.

I’m realizing the same applies to so much online. That niche subreddit you almost abandoned? The long-form essay you almost skipped?  Those things often hold the richest, most rewarding experiences. It's tempting to chase the shiny new thing, but sometimes, investing your time and attention in something that unfolds gradually is what truly resonates.  Maybe it’s time we all embraced a little more digital patience.
