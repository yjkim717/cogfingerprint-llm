**The Quiet Hum of Worry**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we’ve built this world where we’re constantly *connected*, yet sometimes feel utterly, profoundly alone. 2022 was a year of that for me, honestly. I was spending so much time scrolling, absorbing everyone else’s highlight reels, that I started noticing a persistent, low-level hum of anxiety. 

It wasn’t a dramatic panic, more like a subtle thrumming underneath everything – a little bit like those headaches you get when you stare at a screen too long.  I started having them more and more frequently, accompanied by this strange tingling sensation in my hands. 

It reminded me of a Reddit thread I read recently – someone struggling with similar symptoms, worried about neurological issues and desperately seeking answers. It felt… strangely intimate, reading about someone else’s internal experience. 

We’re so quick to share the perfect photos and witty captions, but rarely do we talk about the quiet, persistent worries that creep in when we’re not performing for an audience.  Maybe it’s time we started being a little braver about admitting those quiet hums, and seeking help when they start to feel overwhelming.  Because sometimes, the most important connection is the one we make with ourselves.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a slightly different angle?
