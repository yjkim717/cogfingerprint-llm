**The Endless Scroll & the Yardstick**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt… intense, right? Scrolling through Instagram, seeing everyone’s meticulously curated “perfect” lives – pottery classes, amazing travel, even just perfectly organized pantries – it started to feel like I was constantly measuring myself against an unachievable yardstick. 

I’d pick up a new hobby – sourdough baking, anyone? – and immediately be judging my loaves against some influencer’s Instagram feed. It wasn’t about enjoyment; it was about proving something to myself, a desperate need to outperform a phantom critic. 

Honestly, it was exhausting. I realized I was letting the algorithm dictate my worth.  Taking a step back, turning off the notifications, and just *doing* things for myself, not for the performance, has been a game changer.  Anyone else feeling this pressure?
