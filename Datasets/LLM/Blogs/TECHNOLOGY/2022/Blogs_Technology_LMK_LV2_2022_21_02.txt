"As I sat with my friends discussing our post-high school plans in 2022, I couldn't help but feel drawn to the idea of being my own boss. The prospect of being 'selbstständig' was exhilarating, but it also raised a multitude of questions. How would I manage my finances? Would I still be eligible for 'Kindergeld' if I decided to take the leap? And what about 'Krankenversicherung' - health insurance that was previously a given? 

As I navigated the world of 'Existenzgründung', I realized that taking the road less traveled isn't always easy. I started weighing the pros and cons, considering alternatives like internships and 'Praktika' to gain experience. The uncertainty was overwhelming, but it also sparked a sense of adventure. Embracing technology and digital tools has been a game-changer in my journey. With the right resources and support, I've been able to turn my ideas into reality. It's been a wild ride, but I'm excited to see where this path takes me."
