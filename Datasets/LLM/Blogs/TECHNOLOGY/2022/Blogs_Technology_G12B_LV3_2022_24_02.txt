## The Blue Light Blues & the Engineering Grind

Okay, real talk. Anyone else feel like their brain is permanently stuck in low power mode? Lately, I've been wrestling with a serious case of the exhaustion. It’s a weird combination, I think – the soul-crushing commute to university (seriously, who approved these bus routes?), plus the sheer intensity of engineering coursework. 

By the time I drag myself through the door, I'm running on fumes. And then… the expectation to actually *study*? It feels almost cruel. I scroll through Instagram, see everyone seemingly effortlessly tackling differential equations, and I just… stare. How do they do it? 

I’ve been trying to be more mindful of screen time, especially in the evenings. The blue light from my laptop feels like it’s actively stealing what little energy I have left. I’ve even experimented with blue light filters – a tiny victory, maybe? – but it's a constant battle. 

This year (2022) has been a steep learning curve, not just in circuits and coding, but in figuring out how to actually *live* alongside this relentless workload. Any tips from fellow students, especially in the STEM fields, would be hugely appreciated! Let's commiserate (and hopefully find some solutions) together.
