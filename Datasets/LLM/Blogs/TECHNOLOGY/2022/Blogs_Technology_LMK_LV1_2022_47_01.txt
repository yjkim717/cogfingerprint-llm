"Rushing to Code: A Recipe for Disaster"

As I sit here in 2022, surrounded by screens and deadlines, I'm reminded of the countless times I've rushed into coding projects without a second thought. As an IT worker, I've often prioritized quantity over quality, convinced that the faster I code, the more I'll get done. But the truth is, this approach has taken a toll on my mental health and, quite frankly, my work. The stress of meeting tight deadlines has exacerbated my diabetes, forcing me to reevaluate my workflow. I've come to realize that it's not about how many lines of code I can write in an hour, but about writing code that works. Seeking help and taking a step back has been a game-changer. By slowing down and focusing on quality, I'm not only improving my work but also taking care of myself. It's a lesson I'm still learning, but one that's making all the difference.
