## The Wild West of Minecraft and My Little Explorer

It's 2022, and my six-year-old is obsessed with Minecraft. Which is wonderful! He's building incredible things and, of course, playing with friends online. But navigating the world of online multiplayer with a little one? It's a learning curve for all of us. Lately, we've been wrestling with how to gently remove a fewâ€¦ less desirable players from his worlds, without accidentally blocking his siblings from joining the fun. It's a surprisingly tricky balance, and a good reminder to keep those parental controls sharp!
