You know, I was thinking about my old RV’s AC the other day—that 15K BTU unit just couldn’t handle a Texas summer. It reminded me of my first smartphone back in 2022: so impressive at first, but quickly outmatched by new demands. We chase the latest tech, hoping it’ll solve everything, yet sometimes it’s just not enough. It’s a humbling reminder that progress is constant, and our needs evolve faster than the gadgets we rely on.
