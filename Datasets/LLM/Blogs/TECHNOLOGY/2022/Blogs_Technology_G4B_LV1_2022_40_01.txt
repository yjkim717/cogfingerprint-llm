**Tiny Beast, Big Dreams: My Nuc and the Linux Experiment**

It’s weird, but I’ve been completely captivated by my little Intel Nuc lately. I snagged one on a whim, mostly because it seemed like a cool, compact computer. My goal? Turn it into a dedicated media center connected to the TV.  

I dove headfirst into Linux, specifically Arch, and paired it with i3wm – a super lightweight window manager.  I even experimented with Wayland, just to see what it was like. It’s a surprisingly powerful little machine, and the freedom of Linux is addictive.  It’s a reminder that impressive tech doesn’t always need to be huge.
