It’s 2022, and my old Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is gathering dust—but nostalgia has me itching to play Pokémon Go again. The problem? Android compatibility. I’ve been down the rabbit hole, wondering if flashing LineageOS could breathe new life into this aging tablet. Would it even run the game, or would I just end up wrestling with glitches and spoofing risks?

Part of me wants the challenge; the other wonders if I should just grab a cheap, compatible Android device instead. It’s funny how a simple game can make you weigh effort against nostalgia, isn’t it?
