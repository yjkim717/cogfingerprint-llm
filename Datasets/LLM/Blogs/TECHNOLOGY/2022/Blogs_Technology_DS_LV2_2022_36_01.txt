That first time I used an AI chatbot in 2022, I expected pure logic. Instead, it mirrored my own overthinking, my "autistic" focus on patterns. I was the cold, analytical user. But in its attempts to connect, I saw my own struggle to be social, to find meaning past the code. The machine, ironically, taught me a sliver of warmth about my own mind.
