**The Ghosts in the Machine (and How I Finally Upgraded)**

Let’s be honest, there’s a weird comfort in sticking with what you know. For years, my gaming PC was a Frankenstein’s monster – an ASRock H470 motherboard, a slightly dusty i5 processor, and enough RAM to make a small child jealous. It *worked*, but it was…tired. 

This fall, I finally bit the bullet and started researching a proper upgrade. The goal? Smoother gaming, fewer frustrating stutters. Turns out, a fresh CPU and a little memory speed boost could do wonders. It’s a surprisingly satisfying feeling to chase those “ghosts in the machine” – the little performance hiccups that used to haunt my games.  It’s a reminder that tech, like us, deserves a refresh sometimes.
