It’s 2022, and I’ve been trying to learn digital art. At first, it was just for fun—messing around with layers and brushes. But then I started scrolling through social media, seeing artists create flawless, intricate pieces in minutes. Suddenly, my own sketches felt clumsy and amateurish.

I became obsessed with mastering every tool, every shortcut, chasing that impossible standard of perfection. My tablet felt less like a creative outlet and more like a battleground. A friend told me, "Tech is supposed to make life easier, not turn your hobbies into work."

They were right. I’m learning to step back, to enjoy the process again. After all, isn’t that what creativity’s all about?
