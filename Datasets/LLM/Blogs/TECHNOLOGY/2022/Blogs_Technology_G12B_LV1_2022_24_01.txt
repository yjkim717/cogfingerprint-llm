## The Algorithm and My Hair (Seriously)

It's funny, isn't it? How much of our lives we hand over to algorithms. In 2022, it feels almost *expected*. Streaming services know what I want to watch before I do, social media feeds are perfectly curated… and I was just realizing, I’d let them dictate my style too. 

For years, I'd been getting the same, safe haircut. A default setting, really. Then, a friend mentioned he'd found a barber who *really* understood his face shape – a guy who listened, not just snipped. It got me thinking: why hadn't I sought that personalized touch for my digital life? 

I started tweaking my online settings, unsubscribing from things that didn’t spark joy, actively seeking out diverse voices.  It’s a small shift, but it feels… freeing. Like finally choosing a *side part* instead of letting the standard cut rule. Maybe finding your own style, both online and off, is the real upgrade.



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
