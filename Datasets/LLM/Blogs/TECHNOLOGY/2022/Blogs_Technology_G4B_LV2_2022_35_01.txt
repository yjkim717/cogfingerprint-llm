**The Ghosts in the Machine**

Remember staring at a NumPy output, utterly baffled? I did last month, wrestling with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It felt like the numbers were there, but… where did they *go*? Like a secret code without a key. 

It hit me that these calculations aren’t about a visible change. Eigenvectors are the directions that *don’t* change direction when a linear transformation happens – they’re like the ghosts within the machine, subtly altered but fundamentally the same. 

Understanding that shifted my perspective, connecting linear algebra to the hidden workings of machine learning. It’s a strange, beautiful reminder that sometimes, the most powerful things are invisible.

Would you like me to tweak this or generate a different version?
