**Lost in Translation (and eBay)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How reliant we’ve become on little boxes and screens. I was just obsessing over a vintage postcard I found – a tiny, faded glimpse of a *punti poste* station in Italy.  I needed to ship it, and ended up spending an embarrassing amount of time wrestling with eBay shipping options and researching Poste Italiane’s quirky system. 

It reminded me of feeling utterly lost online, searching for a connection to something tangible.  Technology can be brilliant, but sometimes it just feels like a translation barrier, pulling us further from the real world.  Anyone else feel that way lately?
