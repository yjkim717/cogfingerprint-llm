**The Algorithm of Resistance**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we build walls, even when we’re desperately seeking connection. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with this feeling – a stubborn resistance to… well, everything, really. And I realized it’s tied to something buried deep, something rooted in my childhood. 

I grew up with a mother who demanded control, a constant need to orchestrate every detail. Now, in 2022, I’m finding myself pushing away offers of help from my girlfriend’s mom. It’s baffling. She just wants to be supportive, to offer a little ease, but my default is to build a fortress of “I’ve got this.”

It’s like I’m running a little algorithm in my head – *any perceived intrusion equals threat; therefore, defend*.  I know it’s irrational, a pattern shaped by past trauma, but recognizing it doesn't instantly change it. 

Scrolling through social media – another constant battle for my attention – it’s easy to feel isolated, like everyone else is effortlessly navigating life. But maybe, just maybe, acknowledging this ingrained need for independence is the first step towards letting go, and actually accepting a little support.  It’s a messy, uncomfortable process, but one I’m slowly, hesitantly, starting to embrace.
