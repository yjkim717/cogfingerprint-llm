**The Unexpected Math Behind My Algorithm**

Okay, so 2022 was *the* year I dove deep into machine learning. I was building a simple prediction model, and I kept running into this weird concept – derivatives. Turns out, they’re fundamental to understanding how the coefficients in a linear regression model actually *change*. Seriously cool! 

Scikit-learn made it surprisingly easy to visualize this, showing how small tweaks to the data affected the output. It felt like uncovering a hidden layer of logic beneath the surface of the code.  Who knew math could be so…intuitive?

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a different variation?
