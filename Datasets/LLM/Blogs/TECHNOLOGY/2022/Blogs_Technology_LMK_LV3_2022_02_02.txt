"Emulation woes got me stumped! I was excited to play Majora's Mask 3D on Citra for Android, but it kept crashing. Encryption errors were a major pain. As I dug deeper, I realized compatibility issues were the culprit. It's frustrating when tech doesn't work as expected. Still, I'm hopeful that Citra will get Majora's Mask 3D running smoothly soon, and I'll be back to exploring Termina in no time."
