**The Walgreens Card Surprise (and a Question of Digital Clutter)**

Okay, so 2022 was… a year, right? I was streamlining my life, trying to be more organized, and I impulsively clicked “apply” for a Walgreens credit card. Seriously, don’t judge! It seemed easy enough.  

Now, here I am, staring at my online banking, wondering if I should just close the whole thing immediately. There’s this little annual fee nagging at me, and honestly, I don’t even *use* the card. It’s a tiny digital ghost haunting my accounts. 

It got me thinking about all the little things we sign up for online – the subscriptions, the rewards programs – and how quickly they pile up.  Is it worth the minor hassle of closing things we don’t actively use?  Maybe a little digital decluttering is just what we all need. What about you – any similar tech surprises lurking in your accounts?
