"Tech Burnout: Finding Balance in a Hyper-Connected World"

As I sat in front of my laptop, scrolling mindlessly through social media, I couldn't help but feel drained - a familiar sensation in 2022, where technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. I was exhausted, not from a long day at university, but from the constant ping of notifications and endless streams of information. As a student juggling an engineering course, I found myself glued to screens for hours on end, mirroring the struggles of my peers who commute daily. I began to wonder, had technology improved my life or suffocated it? I realized that while tech has its perks, it's essential to set boundaries to maintain my physical and mental well-being. By doing so, I'm reclaiming my time and energy, and finding a healthier balance in this hyper-connected world.
