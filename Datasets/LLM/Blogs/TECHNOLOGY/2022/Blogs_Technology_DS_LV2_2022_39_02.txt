That first job offer after five years felt surreal. They wanted me—a senior dev—but offered the standard 20 vacation days. I hesitated, remembering the burnout from endless sprints without proper breaks. So I asked for 25, framing it around sustainable creativity. To my surprise, they agreed instantly. It hit me then: experience isn’t just about code; it’s knowing your worth beyond the paycheck. Now, I guard those extra days fiercely—they’re not just time off, but space to think, breathe, and return sharper.
