## The Little Compressor That Could (and Why I Didn't Need the "RV" Version)

Okay, so I dove down a rabbit hole recently. A rabbit hole of air compressors, specifically the Viair 400P and its beefier cousin, the 400P-RV. I’m prepping my camper for some serious off-grid adventures this fall, and reliable tire inflation felt like a *must*. 

The 400P-RV is marketed towards RV owners with dual rear wheels – a serious setup! But after a lot of research (and honestly, way too much time spent watching YouTube reviews), I realized my single-tire setup didn't *really* need all that extra power. 

It felt a bit like upgrading to a monster truck when a hatchback would do. I ended up going with the standard 400P, and so far, it’s been fantastic. Quick, quiet, and does exactly what I need. Sometimes, less really *is* more, even when it comes to inflating tires in the middle of nowhere.



Hopefully, this little compressor sees me through some amazing landscapes this year!
