As I was prepping for this year's conference submissions to top-tier venues like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML, I found myself pondering the status of workshop papers. Are they considered final publications? I've seen many researchers, including myself, present preliminary work at workshops, only to later submit an extended version to the main conference. But does this count as a prior publication? And how do program committees view such submissions? 

The more I dug into this, the more I realized that the lines are blurry. Some workshops explicitly state that their proceedings are not considered archival publications, while others are more ambiguous. As a result, it's unclear whether presenting at a workshop will impact the chances of a subsequent conference submission. As the AI research landscape continues to evolve at a breakneck pace in 2022, clarity on this matter is essential. Hopefully, conferences will provide clearer guidelines to alleviate this uncertainty.
