**The Scroll & The Sprint: When Tech Turns Against You**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt like a relentless sprint. As a tech worker, it’s easy to get sucked into the endless cycle – check email, fire off a quick fix, repeat. I found myself constantly rushing, prioritizing *how much* I got done over *how well*. 

It wasn’t until I really slowed down – actually *paused* – that I realized I was sacrificing quality for the sake of a full inbox. I was building a habit of impulsive action, fueled by the constant notifications and pressure to “do more.” 

Recently, I’ve been forcing myself to add a little self-reflection into my workflow. Just five minutes to ask myself: “Am I truly focused? Is this the best use of my time?” It’s a tiny shift, but it’s already helping me manage those urges and build better, more sustainable work habits.  Anyone else battling this digital overwhelm?
