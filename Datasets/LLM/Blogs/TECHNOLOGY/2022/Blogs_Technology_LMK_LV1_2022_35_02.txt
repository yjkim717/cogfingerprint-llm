"As I dove into building a linear regression model using scikit-learn in 2022, a question nagged me: are the coefficients derivatives of the regression formula? I recalled the chain rule from calculus and wondered if it applied here. After some digging, I realized that, yes, the coefficients can be seen as derivatives, representing the change in output for a unit change in input. Mind blown!"
