**The Ghost of Ethersea**

It’s funny how quickly things shift, isn’t it? I was just thinking about TAZ – remember that early iteration, all bright colors and collaborative chaos? It felt…alive. Now, it’s so polished, so focused on metrics, that it feels a little…hollow.  

It reminds me of grad school, honestly. That initial burst of creative energy, fueled by a shared dream – then the slow grind, the disappointment of seeing those ideals get diluted.  Like a digital ghost of Ethersea, that original spark still flickers within me, a reminder of what we *could* be building.  Maybe it’s time to find a way to bring that back.
