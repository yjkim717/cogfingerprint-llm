**The Endless Scroll and the Echo Chamber of "Perfect"**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt like a constant battle against the highlight reel of everyone else’s lives online. I'd find myself scrolling through Instagram, watching YouTubers showcasing their meticulously crafted hobbies – pottery, coding, even just perfectly organized bookshelves – and a familiar feeling would creep in: self-doubt. 

It’s so easy to fall into the comparison trap, isn't it? Suddenly, my own attempts at learning to code felt… inadequate.  I started to tie my motivation to proving my worth, a dangerous game fueled by the pressure to be ‘good’ at everything. 

I realized I needed to step back from the endless scroll. My hobby, writing, wasn’t about competing with anyone’s success; it was about the joy of creating.  Letting go of perfectionism was the first step to finding my own rhythm.
