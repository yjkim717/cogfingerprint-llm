As I dive into my digital textbooks, I'm on the hunt for a note-taking app that can keep up with my study habits. I want to be able to search for key concepts highlighted in specific colors across multiple PDFs. It's 2022, and I'm surprised that finding an app that allows annotation search by highlighter color is a challenge. Isn't it time our digital tools caught up with our learning needs?
