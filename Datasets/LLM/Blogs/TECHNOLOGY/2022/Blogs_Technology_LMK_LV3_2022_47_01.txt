As an IT professional, I've always been known for being a quick fixer and a problem-solver. But, in 2022, I realized that my impulsivity was becoming a double-edged sword. I'd rush into tasks without a second thought, only to end up redoing them later due to careless mistakes. It was frustrating, and I felt like I was stuck in a productivity loop. Despite being well-liked by my colleagues and delivering results, I knew I was settling for "good enough." The truth is, impulsivity was taking a toll on my mental health. I felt anxious and overwhelmed, always chasing the next task. I've come to understand that self-improvement isn't about being perfect; it's about being aware of our habits and making small changes. For me, that means taking a step back, prioritizing tasks, and focusing on quality over speed. It's a journey, but I'm committed to finding a healthier balance between productivity and mental well-being.
