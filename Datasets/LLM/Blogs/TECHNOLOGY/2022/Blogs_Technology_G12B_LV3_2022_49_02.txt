raveled recently from Boston to Medellín, Colombia, and a little pre-flight panic set in! I was wondering, would a digital image of my vaccination card work, or did I need the physical thing? It’s 2022, and we're so reliant on our phones, but travel still throws these curveballs. Thankfully, a quick Spirit Airlines check confirmed a photo was fine. A small victory for digital convenience, and a reminder to always double-check those travel requirements!
