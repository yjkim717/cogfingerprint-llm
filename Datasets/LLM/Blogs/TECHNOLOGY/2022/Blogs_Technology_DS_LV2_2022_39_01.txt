Remember when memes were just fleeting laughs we’d scroll past? In 2022, they’re becoming something more—digital assets with real value. I stumbled upon eNftMemes on Elrond, where creativity meets blockchain. Here, anyone can mint a meme NFT, and the community votes weekly on favorites. The best part? Top memes go to auction, and you can even stake them to earn a share of profits.

It’s fascinating how technology is turning our inside jokes into investments, blending humor with utility. It makes me wonder: are we just having fun, or building a new economy one meme at a time? Either way, it’s a wild ride worth reflecting on.
