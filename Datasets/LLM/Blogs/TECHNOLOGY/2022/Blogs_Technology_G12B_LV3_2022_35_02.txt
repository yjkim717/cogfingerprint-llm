>## That "Aha!" Moment with Linear Regression (and Why It Almost Stumped Me)

Okay, confession time. I was wrestling with the chain rule the other day – you know, calculus stuff – and suddenly felt a *serious* brain fog. I was trying to connect it to linear regression, specifically how scikit-learn spits out those coefficients (the slope and y-intercept). It hit me: are those coefficients *derivatives*? 

Turns out, it's a surprisingly common question! Seeing a Reddit thread pop up with the same confusion made me feel a little less silly. It’s a great reminder that even when we're using powerful tools like linear regression, understanding the underlying math can unlock a whole new level of insight. Anyone else have a moment like this recently?
