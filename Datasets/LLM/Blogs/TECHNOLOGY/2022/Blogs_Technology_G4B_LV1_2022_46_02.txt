**Navigating the Tech Maze – Starting Small in 2022**

So, I was just chatting with a friend who’s diving headfirst into the IT world, and it really resonated with me. She’s feeling a bit overwhelmed – a total newbie, tight on cash, and based in a pretty remote corner of Ireland. It’s a classic starting point, honestly! 

I told her, forget the grand visions of becoming a cloud architect overnight. Start with mastering the fundamentals. Focusing on Windows Systems Engineering, for example, is a solid bet. There’s a huge demand, and you can build a really strong skillset remotely. 

Being a ‘power user’ – someone who *really* knows their tech – is valuable, even without formal qualifications. Lean into that, build a portfolio, and don’t be afraid to network online. It’s about consistent, small steps, right?  Let’s build something great together!
