**The Carb Quest: Finding Freedom in a Digital World**

Okay, real talk – 2022 felt like a year of constant restriction, didn’t it? I was deep in the low-carb world, desperately searching for swaps for things like potatoes and rice. It’s exhausting, trying to find *anything* that fits the plan. 

But then I started noticing how much of my life felt like a constant search for ‘alternatives’ – not just in food, but in everything!  Scrolling through endless TikToks promising the ‘perfect’ productivity app, comparing every new gadget… it’s a similar feeling. 

Maybe the real key isn’t just finding a low-carb chip replacement, but learning to be content with what *is*, and building a digital life that actually feels good, rather than just chasing the next shiny thing.  Anyone else feeling this?
