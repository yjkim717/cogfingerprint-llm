## Is This Even Art? My NFT Meme Dilemma

Okay, so I’ve been down a rabbit hole. NFTs, right? Wild stuff. But lately, I've been wrestling with something specific: meme NFTs. Like, what happens when you tweak a classic meme, slap it on a blockchain, and sell it? Is it…original? 

Honestly, it feels murky. We all love a good remix, but is this different? Does modifying something widely shared automatically grant ownership? I’m genuinely curious. It's forcing me to rethink what "creativity" even *means* in this digital age. What are your thoughts? Let's chat in the comments!

**Notes on Choices:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Okay, so..." and direct questions to create a friendly feel.
*   **Relatability:** I framed it as a *personal* dilemma, making it more engaging.
*   **Storytelling:**  It follows a clear arc: initial observation, the problem, and a call to discussion.
*   **Year Context (2022):** The NFT conversation was very active in 2022, so this feels timely.
