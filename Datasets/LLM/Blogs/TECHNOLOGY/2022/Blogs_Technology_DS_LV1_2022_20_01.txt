### The Ghost in My Own Machine

It started subtly. A persistent pressure behind my eyes, like a low-grade computer fan that wouldn’t shut off. Then came the dizziness—not the spinning kind, but a constant, unsteady sway, as if the floor was gently rocking. The final straw was my heart, suddenly hammering a frantic, unpredictable rhythm against my ribs.

The ER was a blur of fluorescent lights and concerned nods. “Your CT scan is clear,” the doctor said, his tone a mix of reassurance and puzzlement. Blood tests, normal. EKG, normal. I was a collection of alarming symptoms with no official diagnosis, a ghost in the machine of my own body.

Walking out with a referral to a neurologist and a handful of maybes—could it be Lyme disease? something else entirely?—was surreal. All the advanced technology, the machines that can peer inside your skull, had declared me “fine.” Yet, I’ve never felt less fine.

It’s 2022, and we’re used to on-demand answers. We track our sleep, our steps, our heart rate variability on sleek devices that promise total awareness. But my experience has been a stark lesson in the gaps. Technology can rule things out, but it can’t always rule things in. The most complex system, the human brain, remains a frontier.

So, I wait. I sit with the unexplained static in my head, a quiet reminder that for all our data and dashboards, the body still holds its mysteries. And in this strange, uncertain limbo, I’m learning a new kind of patience—not waiting for a fix, but for understanding, one specialist appointment at a time.
