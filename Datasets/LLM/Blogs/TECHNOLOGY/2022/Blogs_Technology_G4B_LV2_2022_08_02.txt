**The Scroll & the Soul**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt like a relentless scroll. LinkedIn was a highlight reel of everyone else’s promotions and “amazing opportunities,” and honestly, it chipped away at my confidence. After weeks of job application rejections, the constant stream of success stories felt… cruel.
