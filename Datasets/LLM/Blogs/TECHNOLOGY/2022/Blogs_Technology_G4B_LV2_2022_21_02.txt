**The Internship Loop & That Tiny Voice of Doubt**

Remember staring at a laptop screen, convinced you had *it* – the perfect plan? I do. Last year, fresh out of uni, I was buzzing about self-employment, picturing a glorious, independent future. Then my brother, bless his practical heart, suggested a series of internships. Suddenly, my carefully crafted vision felt… complicated.

It got me thinking about the whole “starting out” thing. We're bombarded with the idea of leaping, of building empires overnight. But what about the slow build, the learning curve?  Like, what about the practical stuff?  I started worrying about things I hadn’t even considered – health insurance, figuring out child benefit (a slightly terrifying thought!), and honestly, just the logistics of managing my own finances. 

It’s a weird feeling, isn’t it? That little voice of doubt creeping in, whispering that maybe the ‘perfect’ plan isn't about immediate success, but about steady steps.  And maybe, just maybe, a few well-placed internships along the way.
