**The Echo in the Algorithm**

It’s weird, right? How quickly we default to judging people online. I was scrolling through TikTok last week – a constant stream of faces and snippets – and I noticed something unsettling. It felt… like g-checking, but on a massive scale.  

People were instantly labeling each other, building these quick, often brutal, narratives based on a single photo or comment. It reminded me of that frustration the author described – this feeling of seeing a “hood” label slapped on someone, a desperate attempt to categorize and control. 

We’re so connected, yet it feels isolating. The algorithm amplifies the loudest voices, creating these echo chambers where disagreement quickly becomes hostility.  I’m trying to be more mindful of the judgements I’m making, both online and off.  Is this really progress, or just a more sophisticated way of checking someone out?
