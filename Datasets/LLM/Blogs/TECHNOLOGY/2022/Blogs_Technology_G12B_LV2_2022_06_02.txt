## The Wild West of Minecraft Friendships (and Parental Panic!)

It's 2022, and my kid’s Minecraft world has become a bustling, pixelated town square. Which is lovely! Until it's overrun with…well, *not-so-lovely* online friends. I recently faced the parental dilemma: how to gently remove some unwanted visitors without accidentally blocking my own kids' siblings. It’s a surprisingly tricky digital frontier! Anyone else navigating the complexities of online friendships through their children’s gaming? It feels like we're all learning the rules as we go.
