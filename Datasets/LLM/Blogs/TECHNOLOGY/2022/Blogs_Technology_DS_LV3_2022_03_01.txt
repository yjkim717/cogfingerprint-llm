Remember that viral meme we all shared? In 2022, I saw it minted as an NFT after someone added a funky hat. It made me wonder: does a quick digital tweak make it original art, or are we just selling someone else’s joke? Where’s the line between creative remix and crossing into illegal territory? It’s a gray area that keeps me up at night.
