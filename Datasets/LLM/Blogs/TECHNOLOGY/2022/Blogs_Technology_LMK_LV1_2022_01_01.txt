As a university student in 2022, I was drowning in a sea of PDFs from lecture slides and research papers. I turned to ObsidianMD for note-taking, but wondered how to store these PDFs within my vault without cluttering it. After some trial and error, I discovered a system that worked for me, keeping my digital notes organized and my PDFs easily accessible.
