As a longtime Skyrim modder, I’ve always loved Thaumaturgy’s depth—until I lost a favorite enchantment to a bug. In 2022, I faced a choice: accept the loss or bend the rules. I opened the console, typed those commands, and felt that strange mix of guilt and relief. Sometimes, preserving the magic we love means rewriting the rules ourselves.
