Remember when we all thought the metaverse would be our new living room by 2022? I bought a pricey VR headset, dreaming of digital concerts and virtual coffee chats. Instead, I spent most nights tangled in cables, feeling more isolated than ever. It was a stark reminder that technology, no matter how advanced, can't force human connection. Sometimes, the most meaningful interactions still happen over a simple, lag-free phone call with an old friend.
