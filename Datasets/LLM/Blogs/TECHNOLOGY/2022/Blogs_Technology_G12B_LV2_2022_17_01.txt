## The Spreadsheet Struggle is Real (and Why I'm Losing to My Bank Statements)

Okay, be honest – how many of us *intend* to be on top of our finances? I know I do. 2022 has been a year of reassessment for me, and part of that is finally getting a handle on where my money actually goes.

I started, predictably, with a spreadsheet. A beautiful, meticulously planned spreadsheet. But then… the bank statements arrived. A tidal wave of "ATM Withdrawal," "Online Purchase," and the dreaded "Miscellaneous." It was overwhelming. I wanted to categorize everything – coffee, groceries, entertainment – but the existing systems felt like they required a PhD in finance.

Turns out, I’m not alone in wanting simple transaction records and a way to classify them. It’s frustrating when technology meant to *help* feels like another hurdle. Maybe 2023 will be the year I finally conquer this, but for now, I’m giving my bank statements a respectful nod and a silent promise to try again.
