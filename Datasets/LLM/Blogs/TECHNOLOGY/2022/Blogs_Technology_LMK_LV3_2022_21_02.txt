"Embracing Entrepreneurship: A New Path After Abitur"

As I stood on the threshold of completing my Abitur in 2022, the traditional route of heading to university seemed too linear. I yearned for something more – the freedom to explore, to experiment, and to turn my ideas into reality. The thought of becoming selfständig, or independent, was exhilarating. I envisioned launching my own venture, not just to gain praktika experience but to dive headfirst into the world of existenzgründung, or entrepreneurship. With the support of Kindergeld, a financial safety net, I felt empowered to take the leap. What if I could create a platform that connected students with innovative startups, offering them hands-on praktika experiences? The more I pondered, the more it made sense. By embracing this unconventional path, I wasn't just preparing for my future; I was crafting it. And as I looked ahead, the possibilities seemed endless.
