It’s funny how quickly the digital world shifts. Just last year, I was marveling at how smoothly my new smartphone handled everything—work calls, streaming, even managing my smart home. Now, in 2022, it already feels like it’s lagging behind, struggling to keep up with the latest updates and apps.

I remember thinking this device was future-proof, but here I am, eyeing the next model. It’s a reminder that in tech, nothing stands still. We’re always chasing the next innovation, the faster processor, the sharper display. Sometimes I wonder if we’re losing the joy of simply using what works in our rush for what’s new.

Maybe it’s time to pause, appreciate the tools we have, and reflect on whether we’re upgrading out of need or just habit.
