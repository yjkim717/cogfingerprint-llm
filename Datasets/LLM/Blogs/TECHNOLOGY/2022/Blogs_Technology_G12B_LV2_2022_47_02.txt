## That *Really* Long Sysadmin Interview… and What It Made Me Think

Okay, so I recently saw a post from someone going through their sysadmin interview process, and wow – the final round was a marathon! 2.5 to 4 hours with *five* interviewers? My jaw dropped. 

It got me thinking about how hiring has changed. Back in the day, an interview was a chat, maybe a whiteboard challenge. Now, it's a full-blown assessment, a deep dive into your skills and culture fit. Is it necessary? Maybe. Does it feel a bit intense? Absolutely. 

It highlights the pressure we're all under, both candidates and companies, to find the *perfect* fit. Just hoping everyone remembers to breathe!



Hopefully, this response meets your requirements!
