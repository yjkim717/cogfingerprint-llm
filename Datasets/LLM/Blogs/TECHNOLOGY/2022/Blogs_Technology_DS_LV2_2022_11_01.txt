You know, I never thought I’d miss the satisfying *thump* of a closing book. But here I am, scrolling endlessly on my tablet, surrounded by digital noise. In 2022, technology promised connection, yet I feel more detached than ever. I crave real pages, real conversations—not just pixels and notifications. It’s ironic: the very tools meant to bring us closer have me longing for the quiet simplicity of a world less wired. Maybe it’s time to unplug and rediscover what truly matters.
