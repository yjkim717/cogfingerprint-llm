## The Algorithm Knows, But Does It *See*?

It’s 2022, and we’re all living inside a digital fishbowl, aren’t we? I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how technology, specifically social media algorithms, shape our perceptions of each other. It feels… unsettling.

I saw something the other day that really stuck with me. A group of people cornering someone, filming them – just escalating a situation online for views. It reminded me of the same energy I see online, this constant pressure to document and judge. Except, it was happening *offline*. 

It got me thinking – are these algorithms, designed to show us what keeps us scrolling, inadvertently reinforcing a culture of observation and, frankly, a lack of empathy? We’re so focused on curating our online personas, on getting that perfect reaction, that we sometimes forget to just *see* the people around us. To acknowledge their humanity, their struggles.

Maybe we need a digital detox, not just from our phones, but from the idea that everything needs to be filtered, analyzed, and shared. Maybe we need to remember that real life isn't a livestream.
