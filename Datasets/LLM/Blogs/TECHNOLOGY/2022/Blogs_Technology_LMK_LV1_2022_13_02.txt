"I'm still fuming about the Blockfolio app issue I faced last week. After months of tracking my investments, the app crashed and took all my data with it. I had to manually re-enter my purchase history, which was a huge pain. I'm now left wondering - what happens when our digital tools fail us? As I navigated this frustrating experience in 2022, I realized the importance of having a backup plan in place."
