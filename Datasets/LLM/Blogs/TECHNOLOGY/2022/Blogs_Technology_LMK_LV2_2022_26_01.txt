"Upgrading is a constant in the tech world. As I sorted through my old computer components in 2022, I realized it was time to let go of my trusty Ryzen 7 2700X and MSI B450 Tomahawk Max motherboard. Though still capable, they'd been replaced by newer models. I'm selling them to make room for the latest hardware. It's bittersweet, but exciting to think they'll find a new home and continue to serve someone else's tech needs."
