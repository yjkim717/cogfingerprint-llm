"As I sat in my UK living room in 2022, I wondered if my Italian PlayStation account would play nice with a UK-purchased PSN code. With the rise of region locking, it's easy to get caught up in the technicalities. Does PlayStation Network check the account's registered region or my current location? After some digging, I discovered that PSN validates codes based on the account's region, not the current location. A relief for me, and hopefully, this clears up the confusion for others navigating the complex world of region-locked gaming."
