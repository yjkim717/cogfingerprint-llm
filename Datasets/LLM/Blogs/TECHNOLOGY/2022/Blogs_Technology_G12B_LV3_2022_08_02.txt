## The Scroll and the Sigh: Finding Balance in a Hyper-Connected World (2022)

Remember that feeling of refreshing your inbox, desperately hoping for *the* email? For many of us in 2022, that anxiety extends beyond job applications. It’s the constant pull of notifications, the endless scroll, the pressure to be “on” 24/7. 

I’ve definitely been there. Feeling a low-grade hum of stress just from being tethered to my phone. It's easy to get swept up in the comparison game – everyone’s highlight reel flashing across your screen. And when you’re already feeling vulnerable, like navigating a tough job search, that constant connectivity can amplify the feelings of rejection and inadequacy.

This year, I’ve been trying to be more intentional about my tech use. Setting boundaries, scheduling “digital detox” time, and actually *putting* the phone down. It's not about abandoning technology entirely – it's about reclaiming my attention and protecting my mental space. It’s a small act of self-care, a quiet rebellion against the relentless demands of the digital world.
