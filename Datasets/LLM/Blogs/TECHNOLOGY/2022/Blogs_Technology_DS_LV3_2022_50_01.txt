In 2022, our community center’s soup kitchen faced soaring food costs. So, we turned to tech: a simple app that sources surplus ingredients from local grocers. Now, we craft nourishing, low-cost soups in large batches, blending old recipes with new connections. It’s amazing how a bit of innovation can deepen our sense of community.
