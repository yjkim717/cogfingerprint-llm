It’s 2022, and I’m standing in line for coffee, scrolling through my phone, when I realize I’ve been staring at the same tweet for five minutes. Not because it’s profound—it’s a meme about algorithms knowing us better than we know ourselves—but because it’s true.

I remember when tech was a tool, something I picked up and put down. Now, it’s the air I breathe. My phone nudges me to stand up, my watch reminds me to breathe, and my feed serves me ads for things I only thought about buying. It’s convenient, sure, but sometimes it feels like I’m outsourcing my intuition to an app.

I catch myself wondering: when did I stop trusting my own judgment and start leaning on notifications to structure my day? There’s a strange comfort in letting algorithms guide me, but at what cost to my own spontaneity? Maybe it’s time to reclaim a little of that unscripted life, even if it means occasionally getting lost without GPS.
