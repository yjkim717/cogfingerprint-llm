"As I prepared for my 2022 trip to the Netherlands from the US, I realized I was missing my vaccine records. With COVID-19 still a concern, I wondered if a negative test result would be enough to enter the country. I spent hours researching the Netherlands' entry rules and travel restrictions. It turned out that having proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-19 test was required. I was relieved to find digital solutions that helped me access my test results and comply with the regulations. Technology made a stressful situation much easier."
