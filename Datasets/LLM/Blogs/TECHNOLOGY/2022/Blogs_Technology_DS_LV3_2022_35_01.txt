It’s 2022, and I’m staring at a screen full of numbers—just another day wrestling with numpy and linear algebra for a machine learning project. At first, eigenvectors and eigenvalues felt like abstract math puzzles, distant and rigid. But then it clicked: numpy’s `eig` function reveals these hidden traits of a matrix without me ever defining a transformation explicitly. It’s like discovering the soul of the data, the directions where everything just “stretches” or “flips,” yet stays true to itself.

That moment was humbling. It reminded me that even in technology, some of the most profound insights emerge not from forcing change, but from listening to what’s already there. A quiet lesson in a noisy digital world.
