### The Digital Ghost Pepper: A Lesson in Tech Hygiene

You know that feeling when you’re doomscrolling through Twitter, and you stumble upon a truly toxic thread? The kind that leaves you feeling agitated and angry for hours? I had a moment in 2022 that made me realize my digital life was suffering from a similar contamination.

I was researching a controversial topic and, without thinking, reused the same browser tabs for days. I’d check my email, then hop back to that inflammatory forum, then try to write a peaceful blog post. My creativity was shot. I felt a low-grade, persistent mental static—a digital hand pain.

It hit me: I wasn’t practicing good tech hygiene. I was essentially reusing gloves covered in ghost pepper residue, letting that capsaicin-like negativity seep into everything. The solution was simple but profound. I started using dedicated browser profiles for work and leisure, creating clean digital spaces. It’s amazing how a little intentional separation can neutralize the burn and let you create with a clear head again.
