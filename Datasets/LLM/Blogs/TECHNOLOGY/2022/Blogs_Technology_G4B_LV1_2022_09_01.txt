**The Unexpected Grief of Digital Death**

Remember when dying in a game felt…final? Now, it's just a respawn. Lately, I’ve been thinking about that.  It’s weird, right? We pour hours into these digital worlds.  I was reading about *GunsofBoom* and the idea of characters dealing a little damage even when they’re gone – like a lingering grenade effect – struck a chord. It’s a tiny tweak, but it feels like acknowledging the investment we make.  Maybe games should hold onto a little bit of that loss.
