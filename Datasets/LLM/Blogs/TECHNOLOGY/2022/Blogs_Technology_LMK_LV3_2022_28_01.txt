"Navigating course registration at UC Berkeley was a headache last semester. I relied on the schedule planner tool, but it often showed courses as full, contradicting other resources. Frustrating! As a student, it's disheartening when technology fails to streamline academic planning. I hope the university refines their tools to ensure a smoother class enrollment experience. Until then, I'll keep cross-checking and planning manually."
