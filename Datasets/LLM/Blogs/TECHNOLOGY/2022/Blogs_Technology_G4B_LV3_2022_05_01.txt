**The Pre-Flight Checklist for AI Ideas**

Remember last year, I was completely lost in the whirlwind of NeurIPS and ICML? Seriously, the sheer volume of conference submissions felt like trying to drink from a firehose. And then, I stumbled across these fascinating workshop papers – brilliant little nuggets of thought that weren’t quite ready for prime time. 

It got me thinking: are they just warm-up exercises, a chance to test the waters before a full-blown conference submission? Or are they, in some way, *the* publication? 

I realized it’s a bit of both. Workshop papers are often the first glimpse into a potentially huge research direction. They’re a chance to get feedback, refine an idea, and build a stronger argument. It’s like a pre-flight checklist for a complex AI project – a vital step before launching into the bigger, more polished submission. 

What do you think? Do you see them as stepping stones, or something more?
