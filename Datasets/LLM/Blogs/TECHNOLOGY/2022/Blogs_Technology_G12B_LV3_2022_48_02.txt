>## Did Anyone Else Notice That Glitch?

Okay, so I've been spending a *lot* of time lately diving into decentralized exchanges (DEXs) – the whole Web3 space is just endlessly fascinating, right? And something weird happened the other day that’s been rattling around in my head.

Around 2:22 PM, I noticed this bizarre pattern. Rapid-fire buy and sell orders, almost like a pulse, followed by this incredibly brief flash of green. It felt… off. Like a hiccup in the system. It reminded me of some of the discussions I’ve been seeing on Reddit about market manipulation, particularly around the way bid-ask spreads can be exploited.

The thing is, it was gone almost as soon as it appeared. No record of it, really. Just this fleeting moment that felt… significant. Makes you wonder, doesn’t it? In a world increasingly reliant on algorithms and automated trading, are we truly seeing the full picture? It's a little unsettling, to be honest.
