"Stuck on a Label" - a common problem in the tech world. As I navigated our order processing system in 2022, I found myself pondering a seemingly simple question: what to call the button that pauses our assembly line? You see, sometimes orders need to be put on hold while we wait for customers to correct their information. It's a crucial step in our workflow management, but the label for this button was giving me a headache. I wanted a single word that conveyed the idea of "hold" or "wait." After brainstorming with my team, we finally landed on "Hold" - simple, yet effective. It was a small win, but it made a big difference in our daily operations. Sometimes, it's the little things that make all the difference in streamlining our workflow.
