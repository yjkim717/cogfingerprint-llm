As a senior programmer, I've often found myself pondering the ideal number of vacation days when switching jobs. In today's tech landscape, where burnout is a real concern, negotiating time off is crucial. I've seen companies vary greatly in their offerings, from generous leave policies to more restrictive ones. When evaluating new opportunities, I now prioritize not just salary, but also work-life balance. In 2022, it's clear that having ample time to recharge is essential for maintaining productivity and creativity in the ever-evolving tech industry.
