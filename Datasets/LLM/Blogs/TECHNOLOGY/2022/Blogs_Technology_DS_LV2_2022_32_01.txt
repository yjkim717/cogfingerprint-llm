It’s funny how the smallest tech hiccups can feel like ghosts from past projects. Just last year, after we finally migrated our domain from *.local to *.net and got Exchange humming along, I noticed it: a duplicate login domain, stubbornly hanging around like an uninvited guest.

I remember staring at the screen, a mix of frustration and nostalgia washing over me. All that careful planning, the late nights scripting the ADSI modifications—had we missed something? It felt like finding a stray moving box months after you’ve settled in.

But you know what? That duplicate wasn’t just a glitch; it was a reminder. In our rush toward progress, we sometimes leave little digital footprints behind. And cleaning them up? Well, that’s just part of the journey in this ever-evolving tech landscape.
