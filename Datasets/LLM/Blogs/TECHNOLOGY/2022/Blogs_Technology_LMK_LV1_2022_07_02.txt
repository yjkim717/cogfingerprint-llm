As I navigated the world of ecommerce in 2022, I realized that finding the right fulfilment center was crucial to my clothing brand's success. I needed a partner that could efficiently handle storage and shipping to my EU and US customers. After researching various options, I understood that a reliable fulfilment center was not just about logistics, but also about technology. They needed to have the right systems in place to track inventory, manage orders, and ensure timely delivery. It's a complex task, but one that's essential for ecommerce businesses like mine to thrive.
