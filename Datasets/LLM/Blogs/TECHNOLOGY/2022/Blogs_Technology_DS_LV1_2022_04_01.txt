It’s 2022, and I’m sitting here thinking about how much our world has changed—and how much it hasn’t. I remember scrolling through my phone, watching clips of people getting “g-checked” by strangers in their own neighborhoods. It struck me as so backwards, so disconnected from the progress we’re supposed to be making.

We carry supercomputers in our pockets, yet some of us are still stuck in this loop of pointless confrontation, questioning random “yutes” or “opps” just to prove something in the hood. Why? It feels like a pathetic cry for relevance in a world that’s racing forward without looking back.

Technology should connect us, elevate us—not trap us in old, destructive habits. If we can design AI and dream of Mars, surely we can find better ways to respect each other’s dignity right here on Earth.
