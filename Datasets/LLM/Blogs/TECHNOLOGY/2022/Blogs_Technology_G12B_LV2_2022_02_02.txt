## The Ghost in the Machine (and My Frustrations)

Okay, tech friends, let's be real. Sometimes, the coolest things just *don't* work. I’ve been chasing the dream of flawlessly playing *Majora’s Mask* on my S22 Ultra via Citra emulation – a nostalgic trip, right? But it’s been a crash-fest. I’m *sure* the ROM is decrypted, I’ve checked everything. It’s a weird feeling, wrestling with code and hardware, feeling like there’s a ghost in the machine just refusing to cooperate. Anyone else ever have that tech frustration? It’s oddly… humbling.
