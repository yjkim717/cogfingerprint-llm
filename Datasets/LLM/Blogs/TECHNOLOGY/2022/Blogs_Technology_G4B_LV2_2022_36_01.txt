**The Scroll & The Silence**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2022 feels like a year of constant connection, yet I spent a surprising amount of time feeling…silent. As an INTP, I thrive on digging into things, but lately, I’ve noticed a disconnect between the digital world and genuine social interaction. 

Scrolling through endless feeds, I felt increasingly skeptical of the “perfect” lives being presented. It made me think about how easily we mistake online performance for reality.  I’m actively trying to shift my focus – less screen time, more intentional conversations.  It’s a small step, but maybe a necessary one for a little less digital noise and a little more real connection.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a different version focusing on a specific angle?
