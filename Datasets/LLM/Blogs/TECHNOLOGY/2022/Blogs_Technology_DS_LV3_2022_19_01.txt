It was late 2022, and I found myself endlessly scrolling through coding tutorials on YouTube, each one showcasing developers who seemed to build flawless apps overnight. My own progress felt painfully slow in comparison. This wasn't just about learning to code; it became a personal battle against the silent judgment I imagined from those polished online personas. That drive for a "perfect" project started to drain the joy right out of my new hobby. I had to ask myself: was I coding to create something meaningful, or just to prove I could keep up with an invisible standard? Stepping away from the highlight reels was my first real breakthrough. Itâ€™s a constant reminder that my journey is my own, not a performance for an unseen audience.
