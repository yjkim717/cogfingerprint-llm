**The Tiny Upgrade That Felt Huge**

Let’s be honest, 2022 was all about upgrades. Bigger screens, faster internet – the constant pursuit of “better.” But sometimes, the most rewarding improvements aren't flashy. I was wrestling with my truck and trailer setup, trying to find a decent way to inflate the tires, and I started researching air compressors. 

I was looking at these massive, RV-specific units – the kind that cost a small fortune. Then I realized, for my relatively modest setup, a smaller, more affordable compressor, combined with a carefully chosen extension hose, would do the trick.  It’s funny how a simple, short extension hose – a mere $15 – felt like a surprisingly significant upgrade. It was a reminder that sometimes, the best tech solutions are the ones that quietly and efficiently meet our specific needs.
