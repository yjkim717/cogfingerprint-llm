**The Silent War on My Driveway**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2022, with instant messaging and video calls at our fingertips, a simple parking conflict with a neighbor felt…isolating. I was locked in a frustrating cycle – a street parking disagreement escalating into a real communication breakdown.  

I’d tried everything: polite notes, a quick text, even a Zoom call! But it felt like we were shouting into the void.  It made me realize how easily digital connection can mask real-world disconnection.  Sometimes, a face-to-face conversation, a shared cup of coffee, is still the most effective way to tackle community issues – even when it’s just about where to park.
