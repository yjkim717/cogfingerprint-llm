### The Unlikely Superpower of Being an IT Generalist in 2022

If you’d told me back when I was manning the help desk, resetting passwords for the tenth time that day, that the key to a lasting career wasn't in hyper-specialization, I might have rolled my eyes while politely asking you to restart your computer. We’re constantly told to niche down, to become the absolute best in one sliver of tech. But looking back over my 21 years in this wild industry, my most valuable asset hasn't been a single certification; it's been my journey as an IT generalist.

I remember when "the cloud" started buzzing beyond the tech blogs. My first instinct was to dive deep into AWS or Azure, to become a "cloud expert." But a mentor gave me different advice: "Learn enough to connect the dots." So, I didn't just learn how to deploy a virtual machine; I learned how that VM impacted network security, how it changed cost structures for the finance team, and why it made the developers' lives easier.

In 2022, technology isn't a series of isolated silos. It’s an interconnected ecosystem. When a company adopts a new SaaS platform, it’s not just an IT project—it’s a question of data integration, user training, and security protocols. My broad background meant I could sit in that meeting and understand the language of the network admin, the concerns of the security officer, and the goals of the end-user. I became a translator, a bridge.

So, to anyone starting out, feeling the pressure to pick one lane and never leave it: don't be afraid to be curious about everything. That foundational knowledge from the help desk, the patience you learn from troubleshooting, and the wide-angle view you get from touching a bit of everything—that’s your superpower. In a world of specialists, the best problem-solvers are often the ones who can see the whole board.
