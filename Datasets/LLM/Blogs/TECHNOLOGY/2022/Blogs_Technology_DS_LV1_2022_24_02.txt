### The Screen That Stole My Sleep

It’s 2022, and my phone is both my lifeline and my downfall. I remember one specific night last semester. I was wrecked—the 90-minute commute to my engineering lectures had drained me, and a crucial thermodynamics exam loomed. My plan was simple: crash early, recharge, and crush my studies tomorrow.

But then my phone buzzed. A friend sent a hilarious reel. I’ll just watch this one, I thought. An hour later, I was deep in a YouTube rabbit hole about coding projects I’d never start. The blue glow was my siren song, promising connection but delivering exhaustion.

I traded precious sleep for mindless scrolling, and my academic performance paid the price. I learned the hard way that the most important "tech hack" for a university schedule isn't a new app; it's the discipline to put the screen down. Prioritizing real rest over digital distraction was the real engineering challenge.
