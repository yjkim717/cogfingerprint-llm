**Lost in the Scroll: Why “Tower of Dawn” Still Echoes**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 felt *weird*, right? Like everyone was glued to their screens, scrolling endlessly. It’s easy to get lost in the digital echo chamber, but I was recently revisiting Sarah J. Maas’s *Throne of Glass* series, and it really hit me. 

Specifically, *Tower of Dawn*. I’d always appreciated it, but this time, it wasn’t just the action – it was the sheer *depth* of the worldbuilding. Maas really fleshed out everything we’d glimpsed before, and it felt like a vital piece of the puzzle.

But a truly great story, a truly rich world… that takes time to build, to layer, to *earn* our investment.  Just like Chaol’s journey, sometimes the most important growth happens beneath the surface.
