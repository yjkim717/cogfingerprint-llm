I'm writing this from a cozy caf√© in Amsterdam, where I recently arrived from the US. As I sipped my coffee, I pondered the complexities of COVID-19 travel rules. With a negative test result, I was cleared to enter the Netherlands, but I was still unsure about vaccine records. This got me thinking - in 2022, shouldn't technology make travel easier? With digital health passports and streamlined entry requirements, it's surprising that uncertainty still surrounds international travel. How can tech simplify our journeys?
