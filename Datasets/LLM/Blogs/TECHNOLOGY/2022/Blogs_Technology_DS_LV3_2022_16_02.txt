It’s 2022, and I’m here in the UK, staring at my Italian PSN account, wondering why that top-up code won’t work. I thought a quick digital purchase would be simple, but the dreaded region lock had other plans. It’s a stark reminder that in our connected world, invisible digital borders still dictate what we can access. Always check your account’s region and credit balance—it saves so much frustration when you’re far from home.
