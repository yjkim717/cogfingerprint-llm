"Resolving Duplicate Login Domains in Active Directory: A Lesson Learned

In 2022, while setting up a test Exchange server for our organization, I inadvertently created a duplicate login domain in our Active Directory. The aftermath was chaos - user authentication issues and login conflicts galore. Panicked, I turned to the trusty 'AD Users and Computers' tool, but it wasn't enough to resolve the issue. I had to dig deeper, exploring the depths of ADSI modification to manually remove the duplicate domain. It was a daunting task, but I was determined to fix it. Through this ordeal, I learned the importance of caution when making changes to our AD infrastructure. A valuable lesson: always double-check configurations, especially when setting up test environments. Now, I'm more vigilant and equipped to handle such issues, ensuring a smoother experience for our users."
