You know, it’s funny—sometimes the simplest tech makes the biggest difference. Last year, I was on a road trip with my old pickup and a small trailer, miles from the nearest town, when I noticed a tire going flat. I’d just bought a Viair 400P air compressor, the standard model, not the pricier RV version. As I hooked it up, I realized something: in our tech-obsessed world, we’re often tempted by "upgrades" that promise more but deliver little. That day, the basic compressor saved me hours of stress, proving that sometimes, the smartest choice isn’t the fanciest one. It’s a reminder that in 2022, with so much innovation, practicality still wins.
