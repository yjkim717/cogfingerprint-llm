It’s 2022, and I’ve just upgraded to the iPhone 13 on Verizon, expecting everything to be smoother. But honestly? I miss the seamless voicemail integration from my old phone. Before, I could play messages, delete them, and even read transcripts right in the phone app—it just worked. Now, it feels like a step backward, a small but daily reminder that not all "upgrades" are created equal. Sometimes, the simplest features make the biggest difference in our tech-filled lives.
