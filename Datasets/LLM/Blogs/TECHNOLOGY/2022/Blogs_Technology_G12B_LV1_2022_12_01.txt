>## The Little Things That Bug You

It's funny how the smallest tech frustrations can derail your whole day, isn't it? I recently upgraded to a Mac Mini (M1, naturally!) and was so excited to dive in. But then I realized... adjusting the monitor brightness was a *thing*. I'd always just use the buttons on my Viewsonic, but macOS doesn't seem to want to play along seamlessly.

It got me thinking about the little design choices we often overlook. Why canâ€™t everything just *work* together perfectly? It's a minor annoyance, sure, but it highlights the constant little battles we fight with our devices. Maybe I'm just being picky, but a unified brightness control across all displays would be a dream. Anyone else feel this way?
