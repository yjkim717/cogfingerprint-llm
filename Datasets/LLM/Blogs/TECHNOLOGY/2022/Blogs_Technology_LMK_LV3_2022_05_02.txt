"Re-Entering the 'Normal' World: A Tech-Perspective on Reverse Culture Shock"

As I stepped off the plane in Melbourne after two years in Japan, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions - excitement to be back home, but also apprehension about readjusting to life here. Having grown accustomed to Japan's strict COVID-19 protocols, I wondered what to expect in Melbourne. Would masks still be the norm? How had social expectations changed? But it was the tech-side of things that really got me thinking. In Japan, I'd grown used to cashless transactions and high-tech public transport systems. In contrast, Melbourne felt almost... analogue. As I struggled to find a tap-to-pay machine at the train station, I realised that, despite being back home, I still had a lot to learn about the city I'd called home just a few years ago. It was a humbling reminder that, even with technology advancing rapidly, sometimes it's the little things that take the longest to adjust to.
