It’s 2022, and I’m crouched behind cover, watching my team’s sniper notch another distant kill. My screen flashes red—we’ve lost the capture point. Again.

In that moment, I realized a hard truth about technology and teamwork: the most advanced tools mean nothing without a shared objective. We had the firepower to dominate, but by fixating on individual stats over the collective goal, we lost the match. It’s a lesson that echoes far beyond the game—cooperation is our ultimate upgrade.
