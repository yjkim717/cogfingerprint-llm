As I dove into Go programming in 2022, I realized the language's potential was being held back by the lack of generics. But with their introduction, the possibilities opened up. I created an open-source utility library, leveraging generic helper functions for slices and maps. It was a game-changer, streamlining my code and sparking a new wave of efficiency. I'm excited to share this tool with the community, and watch how it evolves.
