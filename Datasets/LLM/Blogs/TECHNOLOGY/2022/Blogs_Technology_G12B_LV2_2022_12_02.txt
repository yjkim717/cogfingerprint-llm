## The Unexpected Comfort of Physical Addresses (Even While Traveling)

It’s 2022, and we’re all supposed to live entirely in the cloud, right? Digital nomads, instant communication, everything accessible anywhere. But I recently found myself craving something surprisingly…tangible. 

I'm planning a short trip to Italy, and realized I wanted to order a few things from eBay – some obscure vintage finds I’d been eyeing. My brain immediately went to, "How can I ship this? VPN? Temporary mailbox?" Then I stumbled upon "Punti Poste," a network of postal points in Italy. 

Suddenly, the idea of a physical address, a place *to receive something*, felt wonderfully grounding. It's a small thing, but in a world of fleeting pixels, the promise of a package waiting for me, a concrete connection to a place, is unexpectedly comforting. Who knew needing a shipping address could be so…human?
