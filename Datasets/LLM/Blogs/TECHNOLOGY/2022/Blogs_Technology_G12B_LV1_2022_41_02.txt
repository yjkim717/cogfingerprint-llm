>## The Quest for Pocket Monsters & Custom ROMs

It’s funny the paths curiosity can lead you down. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a slightly peculiar problem: Pokemon Go. Not catching 'em all, necessarily, but *where* to catch them all. See, my old tablet, a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, is… well, it’s officially dead in the water for Pokemon Go. The dreaded "device not supported" message.

Naturally, my brain jumped to the internet’s usual solution: custom ROMs. Specifically, LineageOS. Could flashing a custom Android version breathe new life into this old tablet and bypass those pesky device checks? It's a rabbit hole of flashing guides and forum threads, but a tempting one.

It also got me thinking about the broader cycle of tech. We’re so quick to upgrade, discarding perfectly functional devices. Is it worth the effort to resurrect something just for a game? And what affordable Android options are even out there these days that *are* supported? A quest for digital pocket monsters has become a reflection on tech obsolescence – who knew?
