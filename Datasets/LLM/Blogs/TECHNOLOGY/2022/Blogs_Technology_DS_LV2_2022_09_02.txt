Remember when smart speakers first felt like magic in 2022? I’d ask mine for the weather, and it just knew. But lately, it’s been suggesting playlists for "relaxing" while I’m frantically searching for a work document.

True intelligence isn't just data; it's context and teamwork. Are we there yet?
