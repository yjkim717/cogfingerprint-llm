"I'll be the first to admit, I wasn't paying attention when I applied for a Walgreens credit card at the checkout counter in 2022. Before I knew it, I'd signed up for a card with a 'no annual fee' promise. Fast forward a few weeks, and I'm left wondering if I should close the account or just let it ride. My concern is that closing it might ding my credit score. After doing some research, I discovered that having a zero-balance account with no annual fee isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it can even help my credit utilization ratio. So, I'm choosing to keep the card open, even if I never use it. Has anyone else out there accidentally signed up for a store credit card? What's your strategy for managing unwanted credit accounts?"
