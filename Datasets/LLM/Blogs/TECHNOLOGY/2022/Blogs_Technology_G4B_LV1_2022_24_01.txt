**The Lost Language of Lines**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we try to translate ourselves into pixels and algorithms these days. I was scrolling through Instagram last week, seeing everyone’s perfectly curated feeds, and felt this nagging frustration. Like, how do you *really* communicate a feeling through a filter? 

I was trying to describe a haircut I wanted to my barber – a messy, textured vibe – and it just… didn’t translate.  It’s like the digital world has created a new language barrier, even with someone just a few chairs down.  Maybe we need to remember the value of a good, old-fashioned conversation.
