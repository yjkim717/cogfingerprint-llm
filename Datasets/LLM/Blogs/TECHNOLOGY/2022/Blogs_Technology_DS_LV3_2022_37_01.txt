It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my Steam library, paralyzed by choice—and not just the games. The real dilemma? Which controller feels like home for games like *Dark Souls* or those frantic fighting titles. I’ve got the Xbox Series controller, sleek and familiar, the DualSense with its immersive haptics, and the trusty old DS4 that’s seen me through countless late nights.

You’d think plug-and-play would be simple, but Steam’s compatibility can be a gamble. Will the DualSense’s adaptive triggers even register? Does the DS4’s touchpad add anything, or just collect dust? For every seamless session, there’s a moment of fiddling with settings, wondering if the right input will make that boss battle click or leave me fumbling.

In the end, it’s not just about specs—it’s about what disappears in your hands, letting you get lost in the game. And honestly? I’m still searching for that perfect fit.
