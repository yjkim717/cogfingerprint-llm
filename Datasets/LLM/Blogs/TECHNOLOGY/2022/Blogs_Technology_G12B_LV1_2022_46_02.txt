## The Unexpected Route to Tech: A Rural Irish Perspective

My friend, Aoife, was wrestling with a big question last week: how to break into IT. She’s brilliant, genuinely, but her resources are limited and she’s based in a tiny village in County Clare – miles from any major tech hub. It got me thinking about my own journey, which wasn’t exactly a straight line either.

I remember back in '08, fresh out of college, everyone was chasing the Dublin dream. I, however, ended up managing the network for a small agricultural co-op. Not exactly glamorous, but I learned *everything* about troubleshooting, about keeping systems running when the pressure was on. It was a crash course in real-world IT, far more valuable than any textbook.

Aoife’s situation reminded me that the "traditional" path isn't the only one. Remote work is booming, especially in IT. The pandemic really shifted things. A solid skillset – particularly around Windows systems, which she’s considering – is valuable *anywhere*. 

It's about finding those opportunities, building a portfolio, networking online.  Ireland's a small country, and the tech community is surprisingly connected.  I told Aoife to focus on demonstrating her knowledge, even if it’s through personal projects.  Turns out, location doesn't have to be a barrier. It just might require a little more ingenuity.
