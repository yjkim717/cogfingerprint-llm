"As I dove back into Skyrim in 2022, I wondered: would Cathedral Weathers and Seasons tank my laptop's performance? I've always been drawn to mods that breathe new life into old favorites. After installing, I was pleasantly surprised - the visuals were stunning, and the performance hit was minimal. My mid-range laptop handled it with ease, proving that great mods can enhance the experience without sacrificing too much speed."
