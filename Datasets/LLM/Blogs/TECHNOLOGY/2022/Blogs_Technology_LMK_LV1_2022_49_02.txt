"As I prepared for my 2022 trip to Medellin, Colombia on Spirit Airlines, I wondered if my digital vaccination card would fly. Literally. With travel requirements constantly shifting, I was relieved to discover that Spirit Airlines accepted digital vaccine records. No more worrying about misplacing my card or scrambling to find a printer. The convenience of digital docs made my travel experience smoother, and I'm grateful for the tech that made it possible."
