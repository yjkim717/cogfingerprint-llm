I still remember the thrill of landing that final interview for my first sysadmin role back in 2022. But then came the schedule: five back-to-back meetings, totaling nearly four hours. Sitting through that marathon, I couldn't help but wonderâ€”is this really necessary for an entry-level admin position? When did proving your passion become an endurance test? It left me questioning where we draw the line between thorough vetting and simply... too much.
