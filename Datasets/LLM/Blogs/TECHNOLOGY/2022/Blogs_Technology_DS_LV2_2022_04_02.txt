### The Unlikely Nostalgia of a Slow Internet Day

It’s funny how a single tech hiccup can rewire your entire day. My new router arrived yesterday, a sleek little spaceship promising blistering speeds. But this morning, it just… wouldn’t connect. After an hour of frantic calls and resets, I was forced to surrender.

And that’s when the magic happened.

With my phone’s data throttled to a 2010 crawl, I couldn’t doom-scroll or binge a show. I was stuck. So I picked up a book I’d been meaning to read for months. I made a proper coffee and just stared out the window, letting my thoughts wander without an algorithm guiding them.

In our always-on, gigabit world of 2022, we’ve forgotten the quiet luxury of being offline. That forced slowdown wasn’t an inconvenience; it was a reset. It reminded me that my brain doesn’t always need to be flooded with new information. Sometimes, it just needs space to process the old.

The internet came back on around 3 PM. I felt a twinge of disappointment.
