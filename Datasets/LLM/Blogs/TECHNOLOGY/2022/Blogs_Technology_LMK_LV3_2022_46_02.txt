"Breaking into IT: A Journey Within Reach"

As I reflect on my 20-year journey as a Windows systems engineer, I'm reminded of the advice I once gave to my ex-wife - to pursue a career in IT despite the odds. With limited financial resources and a rural location, she thought it was a pipe dream. But I knew the truth: with dedication and self-study, the IT world is full of opportunities. Fast forward to 2022, and remote work has become the norm. The flexibility it offers has been a game-changer for those living outside urban centers. My ex-wife took my advice to heart and started her IT journey. She's now thriving in her new career. I'm living proof that with the right mindset and resources, anyone can break into the IT field, regardless of their location or financial situation.
