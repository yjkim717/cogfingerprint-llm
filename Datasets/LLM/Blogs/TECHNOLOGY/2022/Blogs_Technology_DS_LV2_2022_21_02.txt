### The Unplanned Upgrade

It’s funny, isn’t it? We spend so much time curating our digital lives—organizing apps, clearing cache, chasing the latest software update. We treat our phones like high-performance engines, always tuning for peak efficiency.

But in 2022, my most significant tech upgrade had nothing to do with processing speed or camera megapixels. It was the simple, stubborn act of turning it all off.

I was on a weekend trip, and my phone died. No charger. For 36 hours, I was digitally untethered. At first, it was a low-grade panic. Then, something shifted. I noticed the texture of the tree bark on a hike. I had a meandering, uninterrupted conversation with a friend that didn’t involve checking notifications. My brain, freed from the constant pull of a screen, felt… roomier.

I came back online not with a sigh of relief, but with a new resolve. The most powerful technology isn't the device in your pocket; it's the conscious choice to sometimes put it away. My "off" button became my favorite feature.
