## The Algorithm and the Awkward Silence

It's 2022, and we're *hyper*-connected. Yet, I often feel… disconnected. As an INTP, I tend to analyze everything, including social interactions. Lately, it's been hitting me hard. People tell me I come across as cold, too analytical. It's not intentional! I'm just processing, trying to find the logical thread in what feels like a chaotic stream of information.

It’s funny, isn’t it? We spend so much time curating online personas, optimizing for engagement, but struggle with genuine connection face-to-face. Maybe the constant digital mediation has actually made real social interaction *more* daunting. Perhaps it’s time to log off and just… be present, even if it’s awkward.
