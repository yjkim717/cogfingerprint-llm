## Remember When We Thought Everything Would Be Flying Cars?

It’s funny, isn’t it? I was just scrolling through old tech predictions from the early 2000s. Remember everyone saying we’d all be zipping around in flying cars by now? Or that virtual reality would be *the* thing, replacing actual reality? 

We got some cool stuff, sure – smartphones we can’t live without, AI that writes surprisingly coherent sentences (like this!), and streaming everything. But the future felt…bigger back then. More *out there*. 

Now, I'm appreciating the subtle shifts. The way technology has quietly woven itself into the fabric of our everyday lives, connecting us in ways we never imagined. Maybe flying cars aren't necessary when we have video calls with loved ones across the globe. Maybe the future isn’t about escaping reality, but enhancing it.
