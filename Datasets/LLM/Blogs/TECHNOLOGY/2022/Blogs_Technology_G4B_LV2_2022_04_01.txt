**The Echo in the Void**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we get lost in the digital echo chamber? Like, I was scrolling through TikTok the other day, and I stumbled across this whole thread about “g-checking” – basically, this intense, almost ritualistic confrontation with strangers you’ve just met. The comments were… intense.  

It reminded me of something I read about UK drill – this whole concept of “hood mentality” and the constant threat of street violence.  There’s a certain desperation in it, a need to assert dominance, to prove something. 

But honestly, it felt pathetic. Like shouting into a void, hoping someone will finally *hear* you.  We’re so obsessed with projecting an image of strength and vigilance online, but sometimes, it just feels like we’re building walls instead of connections.  Maybe 2022 is about finding a way to actually *listen* to the people around us, instead of just broadcasting our own anxieties into the digital space.  What do you think?
