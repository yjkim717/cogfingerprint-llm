## The Desktop Dream: When Mobile Feels a Little… Small

It’s 2022, and we're all building for mobile, right? Makes sense. But lately, I've been wrestling with a feeling – a desire to make my React Native apps feel *right* on a desktop. Specifically, I've been trying to nail that familiar, comfortable margin space you see in apps like Twitter or Telegram when they're running on a larger screen. 

The challenge? Drawer navigation in React Native (especially with Expo) doesn’t easily lend itself to responsive desktop layouts. It's felt a bit like shoehorning a mobile experience onto a bigger canvas. I've been digging into different approaches, trying to find that sweet spot where the app feels naturally scaled for a wider view. It’s a reminder that good design isn’t just about fitting *everything* in; it’s about creating breathing room. And sometimes, that room needs to be a little bigger.
