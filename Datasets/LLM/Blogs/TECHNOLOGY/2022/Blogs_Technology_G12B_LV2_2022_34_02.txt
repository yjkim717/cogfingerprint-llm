**Title: The Hum of Progress, and the Sweat on My Brow**

It's been a scorcher here in Texas this summer, hasn't it? We’re all glued to the weather app, praying for a breeze. It got me thinking about how much we rely on technology to just *live* comfortably. I saw someone on Reddit the other day, wrestling with their RV AC – a familiar struggle! 

Remember when air conditioning was a luxury? Now, it’s practically a necessity. And the complexity! 15,000 BTU, 50-amp service, second AC units... it's a whole world I barely understand. But I’m grateful for it. It's a weird feeling, isn't it? This constant march of technological advancement, making life easier, while also making us dependent on systems we don't fully grasp. Anyone else feeling that a little bit?
