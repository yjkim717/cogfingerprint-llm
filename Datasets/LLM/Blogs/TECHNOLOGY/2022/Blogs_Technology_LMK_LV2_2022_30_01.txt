I'm still reeling from the surprise credit card I opened at Walgreens last week. I was distracted and before I knew it, I'd signed up for a store credit card. The good news? No annual fee. Now I'm torn - should I close it or keep it? As I ponder, I'm reminded of how easily tech can lead us down unexpected paths. With a few swift clicks or signatures, our financial lives can change. It's a timely reminder to stay vigilant and review our digital footprint regularly, a habit we should all adopt in 2022.
