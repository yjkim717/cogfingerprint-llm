It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through hardware swap listings when I spot a familiar combo: a Ryzen 7 2700X and MSI B450 Tomahawk Max, complete with that trusty Wraith Prism cooler. It takes me back—this was my first real build, the heart of my pandemic project PC. Funny how these components hold memories, not just specs. Makes me wonder about their next chapter and the stories they’ll help create for someone new. Tech really does have a soul.
