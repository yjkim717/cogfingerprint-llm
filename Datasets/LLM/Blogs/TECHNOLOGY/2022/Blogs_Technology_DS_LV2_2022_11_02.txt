It’s funny—in 2022, I moved Constantiam’s donation store to its own site, just to flex my creative muscles again. No ads, no profit goals, just pure web design.

I remember tweaking the layout late one night, PhantomCaptain and EnderBook open in other tabs, feeling that old thrill of building something for the joy of it. It reminded me why I fell in love with tech in the first place: not for clicks or cash, but for connection and craft.

Sometimes, stepping back from the noise to create something simple and honest is the most rewarding upgrade of all.
