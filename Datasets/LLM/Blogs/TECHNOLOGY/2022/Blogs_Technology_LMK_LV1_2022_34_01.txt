"Upgrading My Towing Game: Is the Viair 400P-RV Worth It?

As I prep my 2013 F250 for the 2022 towing season, I'm considering a crucial upgrade: a reliable tire inflation system. I've been eyeing the Viair 400P and its RV-specific counterpart, the 400P-RV. The RV model boasts features like a longer extension air hose, designed to simplify inflating tires on my trailer. But is the extra cost justified for my setup? After weighing the pros and cons, I'm still undecided. I'll be putting both models to the test to see if the RV-specific features are worth the investment for my towing needs."
