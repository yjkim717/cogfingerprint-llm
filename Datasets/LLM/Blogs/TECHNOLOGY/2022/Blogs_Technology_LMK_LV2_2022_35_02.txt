"Unraveling Linear Regression: A Derivative's Tale. As I dove into simple linear regression in 2022, I realized that understanding derivatives was key. Using scikitlearn, I built a regression model and explored how derivatives and the chain rule impacted its coefficients. It was a eureka moment - seeing how the math behind the model came alive. Now, I'm excited to share this journey, making complex concepts more accessible, one derivative at a time."
