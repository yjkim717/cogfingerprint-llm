As I dove back into the world of Fallout 4 on my high refresh rate monitor, I was determined to enjoy a silky-smooth 60fps experience. But, the game's notorious frame rate issues had other plans. After some trial and error, I discovered that disabling vsync was the key to unlocking a lag-free gaming session. By doing so, I was able to harness the full potential of my monitor and hardware, resulting in a seamless and immersive experience. It was a small tweak, but it made all the difference in my gaming performance.
