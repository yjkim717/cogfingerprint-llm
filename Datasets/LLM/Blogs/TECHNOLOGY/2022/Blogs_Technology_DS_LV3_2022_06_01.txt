It was 2022, and I was determined to finally experience the Commonwealth in buttery-smooth 60fps. But my victory over Fallout 4’s choppy frame rate was short-lived. The dreaded mouse lag made aiming feel like wading through molasses, and disabling Vsync? A one-way ticket to a crash on the main menu. It became a delicate dance in the .ini files—tweaking iPresentInterval, wrestling with my monitor’s refresh rate. That fragile peace between performance and stability was a hard-won lesson in PC gaming: sometimes, the real game is getting it to run.
