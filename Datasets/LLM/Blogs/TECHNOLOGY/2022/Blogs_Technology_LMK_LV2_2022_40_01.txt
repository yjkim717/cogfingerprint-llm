As I settled into my living room, I gazed at the sleek Intel NUC connected to my TV, running Arch Linux. I had envisioned a seamless streaming experience, but a nagging issue remained: how to control it without a cluttered keyboard and mouse setup. In 2022, with the rise of remote access technologies, I wasn't alone in this quest. I began to explore alternatives, from remote desktop apps to dedicated media center remotes. Some touted the convenience of mobile apps, while others swore by dedicated streaming devices. As I weighed my options, I realized that the perfect solution wasn't just about convenience â€“ it was about creating a harmonious balance between technology and comfort. For those navigating similar challenges, I'd love to hear: what's your go-to solution for Linux remote control?
