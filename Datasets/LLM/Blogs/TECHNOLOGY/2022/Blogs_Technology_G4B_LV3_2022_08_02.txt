**The Algorithm of Heartbreak**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt like a relentless scroll through job boards, each “no” echoing a little louder than the last. I’m in tech – we pride ourselves on logic, on solving problems – but lately, I’ve felt completely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of rejection. It’s not just about the jobs; it's the constant questioning of my skills, my worth. 

LinkedIn became a highlight reel of everyone else’s successes, magnifying my own feelings of inadequacy. I started to withdraw, prioritizing ‘self-care’ as a buzzword, but honestly, it felt like a band-aid on a gaping wound. 

What’s helped, surprisingly, is acknowledging the messiness of it all. Recognizing that rejection is part of the process, a frustrating but inevitable algorithm in the tech world.  It’s about leaning into those moments of vulnerability, remembering my value beyond a job title, and actively choosing to nurture my mental health – one mindful breath at a time.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a version with a slightly different focus (e.g., more specific self-care strategies)?
