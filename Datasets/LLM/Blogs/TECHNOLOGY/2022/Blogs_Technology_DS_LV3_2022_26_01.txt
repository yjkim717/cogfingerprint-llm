It’s funny how a piece of hardware can hold so many memories. Back in 2022, I built my first serious PC around a Ryzen 7 2700X and an MSI B450 Tomahawk Max. It was my command center for late-night projects and gaming marathons. Now, as I pack them into their original boxes for a hardware swap, it feels like closing a chapter. But that’s the beauty of used components—they get to power someone else’s new beginning.
