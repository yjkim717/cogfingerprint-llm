It’s 2022, and I’m back in Italy for a few months—just long enough to miss the convenience of my usual online shopping setup. I’d heard about Punti Poste, those handy Poste Italiane pickup points, and wondered if they could be my shipping savior while I’m here.

So, I dove into eBay, adding items to my cart with fingers crossed. Would sellers accept a *ricapito* address? Would my package actually arrive without a hitch? It felt like a small tech lifeline in a sea of logistical unknowns. In a world where we expect seamless digital solutions, this little experiment reminded me that sometimes, the simplest innovations—like a reliable local pickup spot—make all the difference when you’re navigating life in between places.
