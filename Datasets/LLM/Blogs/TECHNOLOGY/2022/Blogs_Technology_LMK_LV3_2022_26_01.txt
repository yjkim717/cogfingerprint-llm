Upgrading my rig was a breeze when I decided to part with my trusty Ryzen 7 2700X and MSI B450 Tomahawk Max. I listed them for sale on Reddit and was surprised by the response. Selling used computer parts not only decluttered my space but also gave someone else a chance to breathe new life into their setup. It's amazing how a simple hardware sale can spark a sense of community and renewal.
