### The Day We Almost Lost the Keys to the Kingdom

It was 2022, and I’ll never forget the pit in my stomach. Our two IT admins—the only people with the keys to our entire digital kingdom—were both locked out. A perfect storm of forgotten passwords and a misconfigured multi-factor app had brought our small business to a screeching halt. No one could access the server, reset passwords, or do anything. The domain controller might as well have been on the moon.

We’d always thought, "It’s just the two of us; we trust each other." But that day taught me that trust isn't a backup plan. We were flying without a net.

The frantic scramble that followed was our wake-up call. We learned about concepts like "emergency access" and "dual control"—not as dry IT jargon, but as our company’s lifeline. It’s a humbling lesson for any small business: true administrative privilege isn't about power; it's about having a responsible, failsafe plan for when everything goes wrong. We got lucky, but you shouldn't rely on luck.
