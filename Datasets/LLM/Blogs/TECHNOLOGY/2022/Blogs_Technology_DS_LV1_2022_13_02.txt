It was 2022, and I thought my crypto portfolio was safe in Blockfolioâ€”a digital fortress. Then, the app glitched. My meticulously entered trades, my entire purchase history, vanished behind an error message. All that manual effort, gone in an instant. It was a stark reminder: in our rush to digitize everything, we often forget that technology is only as reliable as its last update. My trust in a seamless digital life? Severely shaken.
