It was supposed to be a happy 2022â€”the year we finally welcomed a new furry member to our family. The seller seemed genuine, the puppy adorable. But a routine vet visit for a microchip scan revealed a chilling technological truth: our dog had two microchips.

One was the one we were told about. The other, an older one, told a different story. The registered data revealed our "puppy" was years older than claimed. The cold, hard data from that tiny piece of tech painted a devastating picture: we had likely purchased a stolen dog.

That day, technology wasn't just a convenience; it was a whistleblower. It exposed a lie and connected us to a past life we knew nothing about. We made the difficult but right choice: reporting the seller. It was a heartbreaking lesson in trust, all revealed by a microchip no bigger than a grain of rice.
