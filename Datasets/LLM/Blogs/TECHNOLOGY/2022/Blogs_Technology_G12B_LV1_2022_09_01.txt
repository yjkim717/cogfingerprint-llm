>## The Lingering Echo of a Digital Death

It's funny, isn't it? Playing *Guns of Boom* lately, I kept thinking about how grenades leave a lingering blast radius even after you toss them. Why can't player deaths work the same way? A brief "ghost damage" – a fading echo of your impact – could add so much more tension and strategic depth. It made me wonder, are we too focused on immediate gratification in digital spaces? Maybe a little lingering consequence could be a good thing.
