It’s 2022, and I’m staring at this new AI tool, wondering if it’s truly intelligent or just a clever mimic. It reminds me of those debates about agnosticism—some people say, “I’m not sure if there’s a god,” but for me, certainty isn’t the point. With tech, I don’t doubt its power; I question its purpose. Are we creating tools that serve us, or are we just feeding the machine? Sometimes, skepticism feels like the only sane response in this digital faith.
