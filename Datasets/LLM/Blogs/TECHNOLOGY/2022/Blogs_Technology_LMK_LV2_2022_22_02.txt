"Frustration Mode: When Tech Fails Us. I still can't believe my brand new, $1820 machine broke down on me. The 'durable' tool stopped working, and now I'm stuck with a hefty repair bill. To make matters worse, the warranty didn't cover the damage. As I navigate the frustrating world of customer service, I'm reminded that even the most advanced tech can fail us. Has this happened to you? How did you handle it? I'm eager to hear your stories and find a solution to my problem before I take the next step - demanding a replacement."
