As I sat surrounded by stacks of PDF textbooks on my tablet, I realized my note-taking system needed a serious revamp. I was drowning in a sea of highlighted text, struggling to recall the key insights I'd annotated months ago. That's when I started searching for a note-taking app that could help me organize my thoughts. I wanted to be able to search by highlighter color, so I could quickly revisit the most important sections. Has anyone else been on this quest? I'm on a mission to find the perfect tool to tame my digital notes.
