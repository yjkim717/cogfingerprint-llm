**The Weight of a QR Code**

Remember 2022? It felt like *everything* was tied to a digital code.  I vividly recall the anxiety of scanning yet *another* QR code – for restaurants, museums, even just hopping on the train in Amsterdam.  Suddenly, a simple trip felt layered with bureaucracy, reliant on vaccine records and negative test results.
