**Title: Melbourne Feels Like a Different Country**

After two years living in Tokyo’s orderly, masked-up world, touching down in Melbourne feels like a form of reverse culture shock. My first instinct on the SkyBus was to fumble for a mask, only to realise I was in the stark minority. It’s a strange, almost naked feeling.

I’m thrilled to see faces again, to hear laughter in pubs without the muffled barrier. But the whiplash is real. In Japan, mask-wearing was as automatic as breathing; here, it’s a personal choice, and that freedom is both liberating and slightly disorienting. I’m still mentally preparing my vaccination certificate for entry everywhere, only to be met with a simple nod.

So, I’m reaching out. What’s the real vibe now? Are masks still expected on trams during peak hour? And more importantly, point me to the best new hole-in-the-wall coffee shop that’s opened since I’ve been gone. My Melbourne compass needs serious recalibrating.
