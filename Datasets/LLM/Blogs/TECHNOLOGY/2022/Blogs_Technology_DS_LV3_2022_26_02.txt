It’s 2022, and my gaming rig has been a loyal companion, but lately, it’s been showing its age. I’m still running an older i3 on my H470 motherboard, paired with a trusty RTX 2070 Super. Lately, though, I’ve been eyeing those buttery-smooth frame rates in newer titles and wondering if it’s time for a change.

I’ve been weighing the leap to an i5 or even an i7. It’s tempting, but I keep coming back to that 2933 MHz memory speed cap on the H470. Is it worth the investment, or will that limit hold me back? It feels like a personal puzzle—do I chase raw CPU power, knowing my RAM can’t sprint alongside it? Upgrading isn’t just about specs; it’s about finding that sweet spot where effort meets enjoyment, and my old setup gets a new lease on life.
