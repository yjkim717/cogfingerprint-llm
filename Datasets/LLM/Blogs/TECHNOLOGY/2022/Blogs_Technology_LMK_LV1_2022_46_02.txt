"Breaking into IT from the Countryside: My Ex-Wife's Journey"

As a Windows Systems Engineer, I've seen many people eager to join the IT field, but struggling to take the first step. My ex-wife, living in a rural area with limited financial resources, was one of them. I guided her through the process, and it was eye-opening to see her transform into a tech-savvy individual. We started by exploring related technologies and identifying areas that interested her the most. I introduced her to online resources and tutorials that were freely available, and we set up a home lab using old hardware. With dedication and persistence, she began to grasp the fundamentals of IT. In 2022, she's now confidently pursuing a career in the field. My advice to others in similar situations is to leverage online resources, be willing to learn, and don't be afraid to ask for help. With the right mindset, anyone can break into IT, regardless of their location or financial situation.
