>## The Algorithm Knows I Like Lavender (and Apparently, Shisha?)

It's 2022, and the uncanny valley of personalized recommendations is hitting a little too close to home. I was just researching – purely for a friend, I swear! – ways to get decent shisha flavours shipped from the US to the UK. The prices here are ridiculous, and our selection? Let's just say it leaves something to be desired.

Then, BAM. My Instagram feed is suddenly awash in ads for… lavender-infused everything. Lavender candles, lavender bath bombs, lavender *tea*. Like, okay, algorithm, I get that I’ve been searching for calming scents. But the leap from fruity shisha to a full-blown lavender obsession is a bit much, isn't it?

It's a funny reminder of how much data we're constantly feeding these systems. A few searches, a couple of clicks, and suddenly you’re branded. I'm starting to wonder if the algorithm knows me better than I know myself. Maybe it’s time for a digital detox… or at least a search history cleanse. Anyone else feeling a little creeped out by the predictive power of the internet lately?
