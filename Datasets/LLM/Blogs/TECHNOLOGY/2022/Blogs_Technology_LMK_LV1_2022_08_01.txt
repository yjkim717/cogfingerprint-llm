Here is a reflective blog post inspired by the given ideas, but related to technology:

"As I swiped through my socials on my smartphone last night, I realized I've been mindlessly scrolling for hours - a common occurrence since travelling across Europe. The constant jetlag has me sleeping 11-12 hours a night. I joked with friends that I'm turning into a digital zombie. But in all seriousness, I'm curious - is my excessive sleep a result of my tech habits or is it just the travel toll? Has anyone else experienced this? Let's chat."
