## Diving into C3 – Advent of Code & a New Kind of "C"

This December, I've been tackling Advent of Code, and decided to try something different: C3. It's fascinating! Coming from a C background, the syntax feels familiar, yet there’s a distinct *flavor* – a certain elegance. It's like C, but… gentler? I’m enjoying exploring how it handles slices and just generally seeing how this language evolves. Definitely a fun little side project to round out the year!
