Of course, here is a reflective blog post about technology from a 2022 perspective.

### The Ghost in My Pocket

It’s 2022, and I just did something radical: I left my phone in another room for an entire afternoon.

It sounds silly, but it felt like a small act of rebellion. For the last few years, this little rectangle has been my primary window to the world—my connection to work, friends, and the endless scroll of news. My thumb developed a muscle memory for refreshing apps, a nervous tic born from lockdowns.

Stepping away, I noticed the silence. Not an empty silence, but a rich, full one. I heard the birds outside, the hum of the fridge, the turning of a real, paper page in my book. I wasn’t just disconnected from notifications; I was reconnecting with a different rhythm of life, one that wasn’t dictated by pings and algorithms.

My phone is a fantastic tool, but I’d forgotten it’s not the entirety of my world. The real challenge of modern tech, I’m learning, isn’t mastering it, but knowing when to walk away.
