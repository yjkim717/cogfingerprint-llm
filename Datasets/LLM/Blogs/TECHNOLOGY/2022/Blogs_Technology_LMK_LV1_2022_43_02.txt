"To Package or Not to Package: The Testing Conundrum"

As I sat down to refactor our project's test suite in 2022, I found myself pondering a question that has sparked debate among developers: should tests and mocks reside in the same package as the code they're testing, or should they be kept separate? On one hand, having them together simplifies imports and seems to align with the principle of keeping related code together. On the other hand, it can blur the lines between internal implementation details and the public API, potentially leading to tests that are too tightly coupled to the code. As I weighed the pros and cons, I realized that our package design was influencing our testing logic. By separating tests into their own package, we could ensure a more robust test suite that focuses on code coverage and true unit testing. Ultimately, the decision comes down to striking a balance between convenience and test integrity.
