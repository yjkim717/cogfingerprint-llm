>## The Algorithm Knows My Parking Stress

It's 2022, and I’m increasingly convinced algorithms know more about my life than I do. It started subtly – eerily accurate ads. Now, it’s… well, it’s unsettling.

I live on the south side of town, and street parking is a competitive sport. My neighbors, bless their hearts, aren't always the most considerate. For weeks, I've been battling the same parking predicament – consistently blocked driveway. 

I mentioned it in passing to a friend, venting over coffee. The next day? Targeted ads for neighborhood dispute resolution apps. Seriously? My casual complaint, somehow flagged and fed to the digital beast. 

It’s a little creepy, isn't it? This constant data collection, this feeling of being *known*. Makes you wonder what else they're picking up on. Maybe they know I’m also stressed about my sourdough starter... Don't tell the algorithm.
