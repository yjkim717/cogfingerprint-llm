"Debugging Eigens" - My NumPy Nightmare (2022)

I was knee-deep in a linear algebra project, relying on NumPy's `eig` function to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors. But, to my surprise, the results didn't match my manual calculations. I was expecting the eigenvectors to represent the transformed matrix, not the original one. After some digging, I realized that NumPy's `eig` returns the eigenvectors for the untransformed matrix. It clicked when I revisited the mathematical definition: eigenvectors are scalar multiples of the original vector under the transformation. My mistake was in misunderstanding the output, not the code. Now, my code and I are on the same page!
