## Did We Lose the Fun? A Thought on Digital Utopias

Remember the early days of the internet? There was this feeling, this *hope*, that we could build something truly different, something… playful. I was thinking about the TAZ – Temporary Autonomous Zones – and how that idea resonated then. It was about fleeting communities, spontaneous creation, a joyful disruption.

Lately, I've been feeling a bit nostalgic. Projects like "Grad" felt… earnest, maybe too serious. And while "Ethersea" shows promise, I wonder if it's recaptured that initial spark. Are we so focused on building the *perfect* digital space that we've forgotten the joy of just *playing* within one? It’s 2022, and I miss the messy, unpredictable optimism of the early web.
