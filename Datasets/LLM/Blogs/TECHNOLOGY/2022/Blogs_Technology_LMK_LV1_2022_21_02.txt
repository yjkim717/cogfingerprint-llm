"Taking the Leap: Self-Employment After Abitur"

As I celebrated my 19th birthday in 2022, I found myself pondering the next step after Abitur. While many of my friends were busy applying for university programs or internships, I was considering a different path - self-employment. The idea of being my own boss and turning my passion for tech into a career was exhilarating. However, it also raised several questions. How would self-employment affect my Kindergeld? Would I be able to afford health insurance on my own? And, would I be able to gain enough experience through internships or Praktika to make my venture successful? As I navigated these uncertainties, I realized that taking the leap into self-employment requires careful planning, but it can also be a liberating experience. For those considering a similar path, I'd love to hear about your experiences!
