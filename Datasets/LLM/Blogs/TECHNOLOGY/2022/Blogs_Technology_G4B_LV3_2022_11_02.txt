**Building Something Real: Letting Go of the Grind**

It feels a little strange admitting this, but I’ve been wrestling with a quiet kind of burnout lately. The constant pressure to “monetize” everything, to squeeze every last drop of value out of my work – it was starting to feel… exhausting. I’ve spent the last year tinkering with a donation store, trying to find a balance, and honestly, it wasn’t working for me. 

So, I’m making a shift. I’m moving my donation hub to a site built on Constantiam, and it feels incredibly liberating. It’s less about the “store” aspect and more about showcasing what I *love* to build – good web design.  I’m partnering with Phantomcaptain, and through Patreon, I’ll be able to directly support the server community that’s been so incredible. 

It’s a move away from the hustle, towards something genuinely fulfilling. Sometimes, the most productive thing you can do is step back and just *build* – without the added weight of needing to constantly sell yourself.
