It was supposed to be a simple upgradeâ€”just swap out the old spring bush in my premium laptop. But that one tiny screw refused to budge. I tried everything: precision screwdrivers, rubber bands for grip, even a drop of lubricant. Nothing. Here I was in 2022, surrounded by smart devices, bested by a piece of metal. The frustration was real, making me question if my expensive tech was really built for longevity or just planned obsolescence. Sometimes, the smallest parts cause the biggest headaches.
