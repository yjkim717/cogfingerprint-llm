It’s 2022, and honestly, I’ve been thinking a lot about how digital spaces can feel so impersonal. That’s why moving Constantiam’s donation store to its own site meant more to me than just a web design project. With help from PhantomCaptain and support from our Patreon community, it became a creative hub—a place where we could build something meaningful together. Every pixel and line of code was infused with purpose, knowing all profits go straight back to the server. It reminded me that technology, at its best, isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about connection. We’re not just running a store—we’re nurturing a shared home.
