"As I navigated unfamiliar airports and city streets in 2022, my Asperger's threw me a curveball - excessive fatigue. While traveling, I'd often find myself overwhelmed, struggling to stay awake during the day. I realized that my usual productivity hacks weren't working. By embracing flexibility and prioritizing rest, I was able to recharge and make the most of my trip, turning what could've been a draining experience into a rejuvenating adventure."
