## That Interview Process… Right?

Okay, so I landed a final-round interview for a SysAdmin role – huge win! But then the recruiter sent over the details. Two and a half to *four* hours? And five different people? Seriously? My first thought was, "Are they trying to break me?"

It's 2022, and the interview process already feels intense. But this felt… extreme. I know companies want to thoroughly assess experience and fit, but is this really necessary? It definitely sparked a conversation with a mentor about how hiring practices have evolved (or haven’t!). It’s a reminder that navigating the tech job hunt is just as much about understanding the process as it is about your skills. Wish me luck!
