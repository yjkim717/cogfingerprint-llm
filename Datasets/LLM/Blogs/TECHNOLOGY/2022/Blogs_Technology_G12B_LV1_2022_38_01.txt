>## That Annoying Tilt: My Quest for Simple Video Rotation

It’s the little things, right? I was just trying to upload a quick video from my phone – a clip of my cat doing something ridiculous – and noticed it was filmed slightly crooked. Just a tilt, maybe 10 degrees. Annoying! Turns out, a lot of video editing software is overkill for such a minor fix. 

I spent a frustrating afternoon searching for something simple, something *free* that could just rotate a video a few degrees. It highlighted how much software is designed for complex projects, leaving the rest of us wanting a straightforward solution. Hopefully, someone out there has a good recommendation! Anyone else ever been defeated by a tilted home video?
