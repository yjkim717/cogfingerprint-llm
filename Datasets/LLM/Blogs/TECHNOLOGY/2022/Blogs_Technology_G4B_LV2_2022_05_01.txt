**The Pre-Conference Glow-Up?**

Remember that feeling when you finally submit a paper to a big conference like NeurIPS or ICML? There’s this intense surge of hope, right? But I’ve been thinking lately about those workshop papers – the ones that sneak in beforehand. 

It struck me: are they really just practice runs, precursors to the full submission? Or are they, in a way, becoming a *type* of publication in themselves? 

It’s weird to think about. A workshop paper gets a little buzz, maybe sparks a conversation, and then… disappears into the ether. Yet, it's still *work*, still a contribution.  2022 felt like a year of intense research, and those early workshop moments felt crucial, like a little glow-up before the main event.  What do you think?
