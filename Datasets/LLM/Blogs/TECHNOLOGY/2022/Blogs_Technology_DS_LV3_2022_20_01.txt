The notification pinged on my phone—another calendar alert for my virtual neurologist appointment. I minimized the window, the familiar pressure building behind my eyes as I stared at the blue light of my screen. It was 2022, and my world had shrunk to the dimensions of this laptop, a portal to both my remote work and my increasingly frantic search for answers.

For months, it had been this cycle: migraine, head pressure, a low-grade anxiety humming just beneath the surface. Was it the endless Zoom calls? The strain of being perpetually "on" and digitally accessible? Or was it something deeper, something a dozen frantic Google searches for "Lyme disease and neurological symptoms" couldn't pinpoint? My body had become a collection of unexplained glitches, and technology was both the suspected culprit and my only lifeline.

I’d scroll through support forums late at night, my phone’s glow a lonely beacon in the dark. I found a strange, digital kinship with anonymous usernames describing the same dizzying head pressure, the same fear. We were a community of the undiagnosed, connected by fiber-optic cables, sharing symptoms and hope across countless miles.

That virtual waiting room, the one I finally entered for my appointment, felt surreal. My future, my potential diagnosis, was now just another tab next to my email. The neurologist’s kind face appeared in the little square, a human connection breaking through the digital static. We talked, and for the first time, I felt heard. The journey wasn't over, but in that moment, I realized technology wasn't just the source of the noise; it had also delivered the signal—a connection that started me on the path to being whole again.
