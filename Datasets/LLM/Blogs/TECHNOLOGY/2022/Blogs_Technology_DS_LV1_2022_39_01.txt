Looking back at 2022, it feels like we were all trying to figure out what to do with NFTs beyond just digital art. I remember getting excited about a project I called eNftMemes—a space on the Elrond blockchain where people could turn their funniest ideas into NFTs, vote on weekly favorites, and earn rewards through auctions and staking.

It wasn’t just about ownership; it was about community and creativity. In a year full of tech buzzwords, this felt like a small, human way to bring people together. Sometimes, the best innovations aren’t the flashiest—they’re the ones that make us smile and connect.
