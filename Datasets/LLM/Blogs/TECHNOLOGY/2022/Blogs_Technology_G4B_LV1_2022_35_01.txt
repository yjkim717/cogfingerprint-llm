**The Ghosts in the Machine (and Eigenvalues)**

Okay, so I was wrestling with some Python code last month, specifically using NumPy’s `linalg.eig` function. I was trying to understand how to rotate a data set – a transformation, right? – and the output was throwing back these weird “eigenvectors” and “eigenvalues.” It felt… odd. 

The thing is, the results popped up *without* actually applying any transformation. It was like the data itself held this inherent structure, a hidden alignment.  It’s a bizarre reminder that even in our digital world, built on algorithms, there's a certain ghost-like quality to the processes we create. Pretty wild, huh? #numpy #eigenvalues #transformation #python
