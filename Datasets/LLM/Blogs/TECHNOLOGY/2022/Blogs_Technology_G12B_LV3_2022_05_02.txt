## Coming Home to a Changed Landscape (and a Slightly Confused Algorithm)

It’s surreal, isn't it? After a long time away, stepping back into a familiar place and realizing… things have shifted. That's exactly how I feel right now. I spent the last few years living in Japan, a period largely shaped by pandemic realities. Now, back in Melbourne, Australia, it’s a bit of a reverse culture shock, but not in the way you might expect. 

It's not just the traffic or the sudden craving for a proper Tim Tam (though those are definitely present!). It’s the technology. Back in Japan, things felt… streamlined. Digital payments were ubiquitous, and contactless everything was the norm. Coming back to 2022 Melbourne, I’m fumbling with cards, navigating slightly clunkier apps, and feeling like my phone’s algorithm is utterly bewildered by my sudden shift in location and preferences. 

It’s a small thing, I know. But it’s a tangible reminder that even something as seemingly constant as technology evolves, and sometimes, it takes a little while to readjust. Anyone else feeling a little tech-lag after a big change?
