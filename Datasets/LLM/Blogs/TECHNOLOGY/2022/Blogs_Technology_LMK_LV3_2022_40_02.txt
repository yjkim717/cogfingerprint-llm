As I dove back into Destiny 2 in 2022, I couldn't help but think about the countless new players joining the community. With the game's ever-expanding universe and intricate gameplay mechanics, it's no wonder that newcomers often find themselves lost in the vastness of the world. This got me pondering: how can we, as a community, make Destiny 2 more accessible and enjoyable for those just starting out?

One solution that struck me is the implementation of an in-game 'expert guide' system. Imagine being able to opt-in to being paired with an experienced player who can walk you through the game's early stages, offering valuable tips and insights along the way. Not only would this help new players learn the ropes, but it would also foster a sense of community engagement and camaraderie.

The benefits of such a system are twofold. For one, it would provide new players with a much-needed helping hand, reducing the frustration that often comes with navigating complex game mechanics. On the other hand, it would give experienced players the opportunity to share their knowledge and mentor others, promoting a sense of player mentorship and cooperation.

Guided gameplay is essential for new players to grasp the game's nuances, and an expert guide system would provide just that. By connecting new players with seasoned veterans, we can create a more supportive and inclusive community. This, in turn, would encourage more players to jump into the game, knowing they're not alone.

As I continued playing Destiny 2, I began to appreciate the dedication of the community in helping one another. An in-game expert guide system would be a natural next step in fostering this spirit of cooperation. By bringing new and experienced players together, we can create a more engaging and rewarding experience for everyone involved.
