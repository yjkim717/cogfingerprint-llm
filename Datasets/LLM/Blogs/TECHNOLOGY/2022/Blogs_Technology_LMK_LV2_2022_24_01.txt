As I sit here in 2022, surrounded by the latest gadgets and social media buzz, I often wonder: are we losing touch with what's truly important? With the constant ping of notifications and endless scrolls, it's easy to get caught up in the digital whirlwind. But as I reflect on my own tech habits, I realize it's time to take a step back. By setting boundaries and being more mindful of my screen time, I'm rediscovering the joy of living in the moment. It's a journey I'm still navigating, and one that I invite you to join me on.
