### The Freelance Safety Net: My Year of Figuring It Out

At 19, the pressure to have your entire life mapped out is immense. University brochures made it seem like the only path, but I had no clue what to study. All I knew was that I wanted to work in the digital world. The idea of traditional, unpaid internships felt limiting, and frankly, a little risky. What if I hated the field after three months? I’d be stuck.

So, in 2022, I tried something different: I became a freelancer.

It started small—managing social media for a local cafe, helping a friend’s startup with their website copy. By framing these gigs as my "freelance practica," I was able to explore different career paths on my own terms. The real game-changer, however, was the safety net. Because I was officially self-employed (*selbstständig*), I could still receive my *Kindergeld* and remain on my parents' health insurance (*Krankenversicherung*). That financial cushion was everything. It meant I could take creative risks without the immediate panic of paying rent.

This year of *Existenzgründung* wasn't about building a massive business; it was about building my confidence. I learned more about my skills and what I genuinely enjoy than any single internship could have taught me. Sometimes, the bravest step isn't a leap of faith, but building a bridge that lets you explore safely.
