"As I volunteered at a local soup kitchen in 2022, I realized that technology can be a game-changer for community service. I started using an app to organize large batch soup recipes, making it easier to scale up and reduce costs. This streamlined process allowed us to serve more people in need, while also fostering a sense of connection among volunteers. It's amazing how tech can bring people together, one delicious bowl of soup at a time."
