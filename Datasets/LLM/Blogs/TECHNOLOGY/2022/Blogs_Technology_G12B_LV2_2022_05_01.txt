**Title: The Ghosts of Workshops Past: Do Those Papers *Really* Matter?**

Okay, let’s be honest. How many of us have poured our hearts and souls into a workshop paper at NeurIPS, ICML, or ICLR? I know I have. It’s a fantastic opportunity to share early-stage research, get feedback, and feel part of the vibrant machine learning community. But a nagging question has been circling my brain lately: do these workshop papers truly *count*?

I read a really interesting piece recently asking if they impact future submissions, and it got me thinking. We treat those main conference publications with such reverence – they’re on your CV, part of your track record. But the workshop papers? They often feel… ephemeral. Like ghosts of ideas past.

It’s not to diminish the effort! It’s just… where do they fit in the bigger picture? Do reviewers consider them when evaluating later submissions? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Are workshop papers a valuable stepping stone, or just a fun side project? Let's chat in the comments!
