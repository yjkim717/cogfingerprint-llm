Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for that reflective, conversational tone and within the 2022 context. I've tried to weave in the core need (highlighted notes in PDFs) organically.

## Lost in the Highlighter Rainbow (and Loving It?)

Anyone else feel like 2022 has been a *lot* of digital textbooks? I’ve been wading through PDFs for [mention your subject/reason - e.g., a certification, a new hobby, etc.], and honestly, my highlighting game has gotten a little out of control. I've got a whole rainbow of colors marking important passages!

But then I realized… how am I ever going to *find* anything again? It's ridiculous! I’m on the hunt for a note-taking app that lets me search by highlighter color – seriously, is that too much to ask? It feels like the next logical step in digital learning. Wish me luck in the quest! Maybe 2023 will bring the perfect solution.

**Notes on this draft:**

*   **Relatable Opening:** Starts with a common 2022 experience (digital learning overload).
*   **Personal Tone:** Uses phrases like "anyone else," "a lot," "honestly," and "wish me luck."
*   **Storytelling:**  Briefly explains *why* the author is dealing with PDFs, adding context.
*   **Seamless Integration:**  The need for the app emerges naturally from the story.
*   **Year Context:** Explicitly mentions 2022.
*   **Open Ending:** Leaves room for reader engagement (do they have a solution?).



I hope this is a good starting point! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
