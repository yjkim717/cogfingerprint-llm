**Lost in the Void? Finding Your Way in Destiny’s Labyrinth**

Remember that feeling when you first jumped into a massive online world? I do. It’s exhilarating, overwhelming, and instantly makes you feel like a tiny speck in a universe of possibilities. Destiny 2, for all its brilliance, can feel *particularly* daunting for new players. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about how we welcome newcomers, and it reminded me of something I’ve always loved: Star Citizen’s “Expert Guide.” That system, connecting players with experienced folks offering personalized help, felt genuinely brilliant. 

Destiny needs something similar – a ‘Guiding Light’ to ease the initial stumble.  A way for seasoned Guardians to casually mentor new arrivals, pointing them towards the right quests, builds, and even just explaining the baffling lore.  It’s not about hand-holding, but about fostering a supportive community.  Let’s build a welcoming space where everyone feels empowered to explore, not just lost in the void.  What do you think?
