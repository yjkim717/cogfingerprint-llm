"Upgrading to a new iPhone 13 was supposed to be a breeze, but I soon found myself missing a familiar feature - voicemail transcripts on Verizon. On my old iPhone, I could quickly read messages left by friends and family. Now, I'm stuck listening to each one. After digging through settings, I realized this feature isn't supported on my new device. Has anyone else experienced this frustration? I'm not alone in expecting seamless transitions to new tech. It's a reminder that sometimes, progress means leaving something behind."
