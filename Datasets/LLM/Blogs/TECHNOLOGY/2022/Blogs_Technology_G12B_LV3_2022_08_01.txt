## Lost in the Algorithm, Found in the Quiet

Anyone else feel like 2022 has been a *lot*? I've been traveling Europe, soaking it all in, but something's been off. I'm sleeping… a *lot*. Like, 11-12 hours a night. It's bizarre! Jetlag's long gone, and I'm not suddenly a marathon runner. It got me thinking – are we all so plugged in, so constantly bombarded by notifications, that our bodies are just craving serious downtime to reset? Maybe disconnecting is the new adventure.
