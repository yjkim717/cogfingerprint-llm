Sitting in my RV near Austin last summer, I watched the thermostat stubbornly hold at 82°F despite my 15K BTU AC running full blast. The outside heat was brutal—hovering around 95°F—and I started wondering if this was just the new normal. With 50-amp service, adding a second unit seemed like the obvious tech fix, but it made me reflect: in our connected world, we’re so quick to upgrade instead of adapting. Sometimes, the simplest solutions get lost in the noise of more power, more gadgets.
