**The Unexpected Joy of Seeing My Clothes Travel the World**

It's funny, isn't it? I started this little clothing business thinking mostly about designs and fabrics. I poured my heart into creating pieces I loved, but I hadn't *really* considered the logistics. Suddenly, in 2022, I found myself wrestling with fulfillment – specifically, needing a reliable partner in both the EU and US to manage inventory and ship orders.

It felt overwhelming at first. But then, seeing those tracking numbers pop up, knowing my designs were on their way to customers across the Atlantic and in Europe… that's been surprisingly joyful. It’s a tangible connection, a little piece of my work experiencing the world. It's a reminder that technology, even the complex stuff like fulfillment centers, can actually *enable* human connection and dreams.
