The familiar chime of a Melbourne tram should have felt like coming home. But after two years in Tokyo’s orderly, masked silence, it was a culture shock. Stepping out in 2022 felt like learning to walk again. In Japan, my mask was a permanent, polite fixture. Here, I found myself the odd one out, my KN95 a stark reminder of a world my hometown seemed eager to leave behind.

I’d scroll through my phone, a digital tether to my old life, watching friends in izakayas while I nervously checked local restriction apps. My first coffee at a cramped laneway café was a small, terrifying victory. The barista’s unmasked smile felt alien, yet wonderfully human. I was re-learning my own city, one hesitant, tech-aided step at a time—from QR check-ins to finding which beloved bakery had survived via a delivery app. It was a strange homecoming, navigating the new map of post-COVID Melbourne, one where the greatest journey was re-learning how to be local.
