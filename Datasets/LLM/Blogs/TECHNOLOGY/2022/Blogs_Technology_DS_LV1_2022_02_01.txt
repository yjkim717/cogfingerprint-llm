It’s 2022, and my sleek new iPhone 13 arrived today. But something’s missing—the visual voicemail I’ve relied on for years. With my old phone, I could see and read transcripts instantly; now, I’m dialing in like it’s 2005. Verizon assures me it’s compatible, yet here I am, nostalgic for a feature that made life simpler. It’s a reminder that progress isn’t always linear, and sometimes, the little conveniences matter most.
