It was late 2022, and the crypto winter had me rethinking my positions. My stETH was sitting in my Ledger, a quiet reminder of more optimistic days with Lido. I knew I needed to unstake, but the process felt like a labyrinth. Could I just send my STETH between my own Ledger accounts? Was Curve the right pool for this swap, or was I about to make a costly mistake?

That moment of hesitation was profound. It wasn't just about navigating smart contracts; it was a personal checkpoint. It forced me to move from passive holding to active, deliberate management of my digital assets, a necessary step in taking true ownership of my financial future in web3.
