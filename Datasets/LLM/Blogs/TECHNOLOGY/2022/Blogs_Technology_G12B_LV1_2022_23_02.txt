## The Button That Almost Wasn't

It's funny the little things that stick with you, right? I was wrestling with a UI design problem at work last week – a seemingly minor detail in our new order processing system. We needed a button for orders flagged as needing more customer info before moving forward. The obvious choice? “Reject.” But that felt…harsh. Like we were immediately dismissing the customer.

We brainstormed for ages. "Hold"? Too passive. "Review"? Too generic. Finally, someone suggested "Interrogate." (Okay, maybe a *little* dramatic, but it sparked something!) Ultimately, we landed on "Verify." It felt cleaner, more proactive, less accusatory. 

It’s a tiny detail, but it highlights something bigger. Technology isn't just about efficiency; it’s about shaping the *experience*. Even a simple button can communicate tone and build trust. In 2022, with everyone hyper-aware of online interactions, that matters more than ever.



Hope this meets your request!
