"Unstaking stETH: A Journey Through Lido and Curve. As I navigated the complex world of Ethereum staking in 2022, I found myself stuck with stETH tokens on Lido. My goal was simple: convert them back to ETH. But, the process was anything but straightforward. With my Ledger wallet at the ready, I dove into the process, only to discover that unstaking involved a detour through Curve. The journey was a rollercoaster of transactions and approvals, but I finally emerged with my ETH. If you're facing a similar challenge, take a deep breath and follow my steps. With patience and the right guidance, you'll be unstaking like a pro in no time."
