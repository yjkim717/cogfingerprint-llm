For years, my "signature" hairstyle was a relic from a high school yearbook. Iâ€™d walk into the same barber, point vaguely at my head, and end up with the same uninspired side part. It was functional, but it wasn't *me*. The turning point came during a trip to Okinawa, watching people with styles that genuinely suited them. I finally asked my barber at QB House for a real consultation. It turns out, the right question was all I needed to find a cut that finally fits.
