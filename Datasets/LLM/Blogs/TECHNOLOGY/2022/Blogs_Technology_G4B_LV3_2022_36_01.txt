**The Quiet Scroll**

There’s something… isolating about endlessly scrolling in 2022. As an INTP, I crave deep understanding, but often feel like my quiet observations are mistaken for coldness. I’ve realized I’m terrified of not being *seen*, of being labeled as skeptical or detached. It’s a constant battle between wanting connection and needing space. Maybe the key isn’t to change who I am, but to find ways to share my perspective with genuine empathy – a little less scroll, a little more thoughtful engagement.
