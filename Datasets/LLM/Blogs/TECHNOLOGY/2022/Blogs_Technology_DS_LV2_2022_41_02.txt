It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my old Samsung tablet, wondering if I can breathe new life into it with LineageOS. I’ve read whispers online—maybe it could even run Pokémon Go, maybe even spoof my location to catch ’em all from my couch. There’s something deeply human about this tinkering, this refusal to let a device just die. But as I scroll through forums, a familiar doubt creeps in. Is this about utility, or just nostalgia? Am I trying to solve a problem, or just chasing the ghost of a simpler tech era? Sometimes, the upgrade we're really after isn't for the device, but for ourselves.
