You know that moment when you’re just trying to buy toothpaste and suddenly you’re signing up for a store credit card? Yeah, that happened to me at Walgreens last week. I was tapping through prompts on the card reader, and before I knew it, I’d accidentally opened an account. No annual fee, but they needed my SSN—cue the panic.

It got me thinking: in 2022, our digital lives are so seamless, yet so fragile. One misplaced tap, and suddenly your financial footprint shifts. Do I close it and risk a credit hit, or keep it and feel that nagging “what if?” It’s a tiny reminder that even in a tech-saturated world, a little human caution still goes a long way.
