raveled through countless airport security lines this year, I've become acutely aware of our reliance on digital proof. Remember lugging paper vaccination cards? Now, a grainy photo on my phone is supposed to be the golden ticket. It's convenient, sure, but a little unsettling, isn't it? Trusting a rectangle of glass with something so vital feels…new. I wonder what future travel – and life – will demand we digitally represent.
