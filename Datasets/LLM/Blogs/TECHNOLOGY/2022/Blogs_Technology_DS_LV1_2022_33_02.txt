There I was in early 2022, comfortably settled with YouTube Vanced, when suddenly the comments section went blank. My first instinct was to blame the app, so I nervously switched back to the stock YouTube app—same silence. A quick check on Newpipe confirmed it: this was a widespread YouTube server hiccup. It was a small but telling moment, a reminder of how our digital conveniences are tethered to distant servers. We customize our experience, but ultimately, we’re all connected to the same digital pulse.
