## Leveling Up: My Little Corner of the Web & Supporting Creativity

It's been a bit of a whirlwind lately! I've been quietly working on something behind the scenes, and I'm excited to finally share it. My Constantiam donation store has officially moved to a new platform. Why the shift? Honestly, it’s about streamlining things and allowing me to focus on what I truly love: web design and creating helpful resources. 

For a long time, juggling the store with everything else felt like spinning too many plates. This move lets me dedicate more energy to building better tools and sharing them with you all. 

And the best part? 100% of the profits from the store go directly to supporting PhantomCaptain – a creator whose work I deeply admire and believe in. If you're looking for a more direct way to support his incredible content, there’s also a Patreon page set up. It’s all about fostering creativity and building a community, and I'm so grateful to be a small part of it. Thanks for being here!
