## Lost in the Light? Why Destiny 2 Needs a Helping Hand (and Maybe We All Do)

Okay, let's be honest. Remember that feeling of walking into a brand new game, brimming with excitement, only to be immediately… overwhelmed? I certainly do. And lately, I've been thinking a lot about that feeling in the context of *Destiny 2*.

The game is gorgeous, the gunplay is phenomenal, and the lore is *deep*. But for new players jumping in, especially in 2022 with its ever-expanding universe, it can feel like being dropped into a galactic library without a card catalog. You’re surrounded by knowledge, but have no idea where to even *begin*.

I saw a really interesting idea floating around the community recently – a formal "Guiding Light" system, essentially pairing new players with experienced Guardians. Think of it like Star Citizen's expert guide platform, but built right into *Destiny 2*. 

It got me thinking: isn't this a broader issue? So much of modern technology, from sprawling MMOs to complex software suites, assumes a level of prior knowledge that leaves many feeling lost. We’re all, in a way, new players at some point. 

Maybe we need more built-in support, more readily available mentorship, not just in games, but across the digital landscape. A little guidance can go a long way in making technology feel less daunting and more… welcoming. Wouldn't that be something?
