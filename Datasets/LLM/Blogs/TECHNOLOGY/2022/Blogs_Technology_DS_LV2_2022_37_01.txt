It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my Steam library, paralyzed by choice—and not just the games. My old Xbox 360 controller is finally showing its age, and I’m caught in the modern gamer’s classic dilemma: Xbox Series, DualSense, or stick with the trusty DS4?

I remember the days when plug-and-play was a dream. Now, it’s about which controller feels like an extension of my hands during a frantic fighting game combo. Will the prompts match on-screen? Will Steam play nice? It’s funny how a simple peripheral can become such a personal decision.

I’ve spent more time researching button layouts and compatibility than actually playing lately. It’s a weirdly reflective process, making me realize how much I value that seamless, intuitive connection to the game. Here’s to hoping my next controller isn’t just a tool, but a bridge back to why I fell in love with gaming in the first place.
