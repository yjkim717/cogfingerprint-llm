## The Workshop Question: Does Early Sharing Hurt Your Main Shot?

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with something lately, and figured I'd throw it out there in case anyone else has felt the same. As machine learning research accelerates, we’re all pushing to get our work out there. But with fantastic workshops popping up alongside NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR – it brings up a tricky question. 

Does publishing in a workshop, even a really good one, somehow diminish your chances of getting into the “big leagues” later? A recent Reddit thread really sparked this thought. It’s a valid concern! We want visibility, but not at the expense of future opportunities. It feels like navigating a delicate balance in this fast-paced field – sharing early while preserving your core research's impact. Anyone else pondering this in 2022?
