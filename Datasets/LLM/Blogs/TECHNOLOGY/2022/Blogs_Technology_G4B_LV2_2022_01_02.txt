**The Algorithm Knows My Parking Spot**

It’s weird how quickly technology can feel…personal. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over my street parking – a surprisingly fraught battle in this city. It started with a simple app tracking availability, but now it feels like the algorithm *knows* I need a space near my building. 

Then my neighbor started parking a little too close, triggering a mini-drama. It’s funny, right? We’re relying on digital tools for convenience, but sometimes they just highlight the everyday frustrations of urban living, like a good old-fashioned neighbor dispute.  Anyone else feeling this tech-induced tension?
