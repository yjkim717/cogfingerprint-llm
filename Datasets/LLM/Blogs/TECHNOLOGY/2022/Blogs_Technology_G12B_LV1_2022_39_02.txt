>## The Algorithm and My August Escape

Remember back in 2022 when everyone was *still* figuring out the post-pandemic work rhythm? I was too. I’d spent months glued to my screen, fueled by caffeine and the relentless hum of project deadlines. Then August rolled around, and suddenly, the weight of it all felt… crushing.

I realized I was staring at a spreadsheet of vacation days, feeling oddly detached. We're so obsessed with optimizing everything – our routines, our productivity – but what about optimizing *rest*?  It made me wonder: are we so conditioned to hustle that we’ve forgotten how to truly disconnect? I finally booked a week off, and honestly, it felt like hacking the system, reclaiming a little bit of myself from the algorithm. It was a much-needed reminder that sometimes, the most productive thing you can do is absolutely nothing.
