## The Meme, the NFT, and My Existential Dread

Okay, so NFTs. We're all trying to figure them out, right? Lately, I've been spiraling about something specific: meme NFTs. Like, you take a classic Distracted Boyfriend, slap a filter on it, and sell it as art. Is that…legal? Is it *original*? 

It feels like we're dancing around the edges of copyright and intellectual property in a weird, digital shuffle. Suddenly, everything feels remixable, everything’s a potential building block. It's exciting, but also a little unsettling. Are we entering a world where true originality is just…impossible? Maybe I'm overthinking it. But the question definitely stuck with me this week.
