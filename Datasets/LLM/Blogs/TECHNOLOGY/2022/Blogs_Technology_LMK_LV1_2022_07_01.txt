As I navigated the online marketplace in 2022, I stumbled upon a harsh reality: sustainable clothing, despite its eco-friendly appeal, wasn't selling. Smaller brands, like the one I was working with, were struggling to stay afloat due to their higher price tags. The entrepreneur behind a sustainable underwear line shared her struggles with me - she wanted to sell at cost price, but needed an online platform to make it happen. It got me thinking - can tech be the answer to making sustainable fashion more accessible, and not just a luxury for the few?
