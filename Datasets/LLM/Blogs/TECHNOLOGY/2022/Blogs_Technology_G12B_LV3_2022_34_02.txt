## The Heat is On (and My RV is Feeling It!)

Okay, folks, let's be real. Living the RV life is amazing – freedom, adventure, seeing the country… But Texas summers? They’re a whole different beast. This year, with the heatwave hitting Central Texas *hard*, my little 284BHS is struggling to keep up with just one AC unit. 

It got me thinking about how reliant we are on technology to just *live* comfortably. Back in the day, folks dealt with this heat with fans and shade. Now, we expect instant, climate-controlled bliss. I'm seriously considering biting the bullet and upgrading to a second AC – a bit of a pricey investment, but honestly, sanity might depend on it! Anyone else battling the heat and tech solutions this summer? Let's commiserate!
