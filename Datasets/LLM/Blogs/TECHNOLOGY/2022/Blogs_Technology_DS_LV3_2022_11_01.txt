It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through endless tech hype about AI and the metaverse. Everyone’s searching for the next digital god, a system with all the answers. But I’m not an agnostic, waiting for proof. I’m a firm atheist in this religion of technology. My disbelief isn't skepticism; it’s a conscious choice. I don’t doubt its power—I just don’t worship at its altar. I find my truth beyond the screen, in the beautifully unoptimized human experience.
