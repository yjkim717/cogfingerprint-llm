>## The Echo in the Conference Hall

It's late 2022, and the AI landscape feels… chaotic, in a good way. We're seeing incredible breakthroughs, fueled by ever-evolving machine learning models. But something’s been rattling around in my head lately, sparked by a conversation about NeurIPS and ICML. 

Do those workshop papers *really* count? I mean, we all frantically churn them out - quick explorations, promising initial results, a chance to get feedback before a full conference submission. But are they treated as true publications? And, more importantly, do they subtly shape the playing field for future submissions?

I've noticed a trend. Ideas floated in workshops, even if preliminary, sometimes seem to reappear, refined, in the main conference tracks the following year. It raises questions about the pressure to publish, the speed of innovation, and the potential for a sort of echo chamber within the AI community. Are we building upon a foundation of “almost-there” research, or is it a necessary stepping stone toward the truly groundbreaking work? It's a thought I can't quite shake.



Hopefully, this is what you had in mind.
