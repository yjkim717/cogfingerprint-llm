**The Urgent Scroll and the Empty Inbox**

Let's be honest, 2022 felt like a constant sprint, didn’t it? For me, it was particularly true in my IT work. I’d get sucked into the urgent scroll – a new alert, a frantic Slack message – and suddenly I was just *doing*, churning out code, fixing bugs, responding to emails… without really *thinking*. 

It quickly became a pattern: a frantic burst of productivity followed by a wave of frustration. I’d ship something out, only to spend the next few hours dissecting it, realizing it was sloppy, rushed, and frankly, not very good. It felt like I was prioritizing speed over quality, and the cycle of reflection and regret started again. 

I’m learning that true productivity isn’t about how *much* you do, but about the *quality* of what you do.  Right now, I’m trying to build in more moments of self-awareness, a little reflection before I hit ‘send.’ It's a small change, but it’s making a huge difference in my work-life balance – and my sanity.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different length?
