>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone and fitting a 2022 context.  I've tried to capture the essence of the question while making it engaging.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Golden Handcuffs? Tech Salaries & The Hidden Costs**

Okay, let's be real. 2022 has been *wild* in tech. We've seen salaries skyrocket, job offers flying around like confetti, and a general feeling of…opportunity. But lately, a nagging question has been circling in my mind, and I’m betting some of you feel it too.

Does the big paycheck *always* come at a price?

I've been watching friends make jumps to seemingly dream roles – the kind with the impressive titles and the six-figure salaries. And then I hear whispers…longer hours, constant pressure, a blurring of lines between work and life.  It makes me wonder: are we chasing the golden handcuffs?

I’m not saying higher pay isn't amazing (trust me, it is!). But I’m starting to think we need to be more honest about the potential trade-offs. What's *your* experience? Are the increased demands worth the financial reward? Let's chat in the comments – I'm genuinely curious.
