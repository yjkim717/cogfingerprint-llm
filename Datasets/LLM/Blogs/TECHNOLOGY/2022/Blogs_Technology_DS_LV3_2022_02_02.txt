It was late 2022, and I was determined to relive Majora’s Mask 3D on my S22 Ultra. I’d decrypted the files, tweaked the Citra emulator settings—surely my hardware could handle it. But every time the clock tower loomed, the screen froze. That familiar crash. It’s funny how chasing nostalgia through emulation reminds you that some magic, even when unlocked, still needs the right key. The community forums are my next stop.
