>## The Pause Button on 'No'

We’ve all been there, right? Clicking through an online order, feeling that little thrill of anticipation, only to be met with a frustrating roadblock. Sometimes, things need a little more clarity. As developers, we're constantly refining user experiences, and a small detail has been on my mind lately: that button. You know, the one that *could* say "Reject," but really means "Let’s just check something."

I'm searching for the perfect label. Something that conveys a temporary pause, an invitation to collaborate with the customer, not a blunt dismissal. It’s a reminder that even in the age of automation, a little human touch – a simple "Interrogate" or "Clarify" - can make all the difference.
