>## The Golden Handcuffs? A Tech Salary Question

It's 2022, and the tech job market feels… intense. Everywhere you look, there are headlines about six-figure salaries and signing bonuses that could rival a down payment on a house. It’s undeniably tempting. But lately, a niggle of doubt has been creeping into my thoughts.
