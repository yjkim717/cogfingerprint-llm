**The Ghost in My iPhone 13**

Okay, so I just got the iPhone 13 last month, and I was *so* excited. I’ve been a loyal iPhone user for years, and I’m used to my voicemail being reliably accessible through the phone app. But… it’s gone. Vanished. Completely missing. It’s bizarre! 

I checked with Verizon, and they confirmed my voicemail *should* be there, but it’s just not showing up in the app. It's like a little ghost of a feature. It’s a frustrating reminder that even the newest tech can still have quirks, and sometimes, the things we take for granted just… disappear.  Anyone else experiencing this?

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
