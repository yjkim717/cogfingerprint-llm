I'm still reeling from my European escapade, where I found myself snoozing 11-12 hours a night. Was it jetlag or something more? As I navigated the continent, my phone became my lifeline - Google Maps, translation apps, and social media kept me connected. But was it also a crutch? In 2022, our reliance on tech can be both a blessing and a curse. I'm left wondering: was my excessive sleep a symptom of digital fatigue? As I reflect on my travels, I'm forced to confront the blurred lines between tech convenience and personal well-being.
