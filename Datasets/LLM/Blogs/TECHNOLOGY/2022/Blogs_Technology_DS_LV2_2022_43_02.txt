### The Day My Tests Stopped Being Nosy Neighbors

I used to think that for a test to be truly effective, it needed to see everything. My unit tests lived right next to my source code, peeking into private methods and fiddling with internal state. My code coverage was a beautiful, near-perfect green, and I felt like a testing champion.

Then, everything broke.

A simple refactor—changing a completely internal algorithm—shattered dozens of my tests. They weren’t verifying that the code *worked*; they were just confirming that I had typed what I thought I had typed. I was testing the *how*, not the *what*. The high coverage was a mirage, masking fragile, brittle tests.

That’s when I discovered the power of the `_test` package. It forced a beautiful separation. My tests could no longer be nosy neighbors rummaging through my cupboards. Instead, they became polite guests who only interacted with the public interface—the front door.

Suddenly, my tests were resilient. I could rewrite entire internal modules without a single test failing, as long as the promised behavior remained the same. It was a humbling shift from white-box micromanagement to trusting the contract. My tests finally stopped being about control and started being about confidence. And that’s a freedom every developer deserves.
