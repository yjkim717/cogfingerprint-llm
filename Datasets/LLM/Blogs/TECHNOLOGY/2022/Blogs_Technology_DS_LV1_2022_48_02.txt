**The Ghost in the Machine: Watching the Bots Trade**

I was staring at a real-time market data feed in 2022, watching a stock that just wouldn't budge. It felt like trying to push a car in neutral—lots of effort, no movement. The bid and ask prices were flickering, a frantic digital dance of orders being placed and canceled in milliseconds.

It hit me then: I wasn't just watching a stock; I was watching a sophisticated, automated tug-of-war. This rapid-fire cycling of orders, I realized, wasn't just noise. It was a technological barrier, a wall of algorithms designed to absorb natural buy or sell interest before it could ever truly influence the price. The order flow was being manipulated not by a person in a loud pit, but by silent code running in a data center miles away.

It’s a strange feeling, witnessing a market that’s less about human judgment and more about which system can blink fastest. Technology was supposed to make markets more efficient, but sometimes it just feels like it’s built a smarter ghost.
