"As I sit here in 2022, I'm excited to share that I've migrated my Constantiam donation store to a fresh new website. The old site was starting to feel stale, and I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to revamp and expand my offerings. As phantomcaptain, I've been pouring my heart into Constantiam, and I'm eager to provide more resources for fans. If you're interested in supporting my work, you can now do so through my Patreon or by checking out the new donation store. Here's to a brighter, more Constantiam-filled future!"
