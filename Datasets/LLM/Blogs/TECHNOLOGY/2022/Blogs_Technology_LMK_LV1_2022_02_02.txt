"I was excited to play Majoras Mask 3D on my Android device using Citra Enhanced in 2022, but Citra kept crashing. Despite having a powerful SD 8 Gen 1 processor, the game showed an encryption error. I tried various fixes, but nothing worked. Emulation on Android can be hit-or-miss, and I was disappointed. Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Citra MMJ? I'd love to hear your solutions."
