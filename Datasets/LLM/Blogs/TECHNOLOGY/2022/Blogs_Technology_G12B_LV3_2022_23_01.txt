## The Highlighter Struggle is Real (and I Need Help!)

Okay, fellow students and lifelong learners, let's be honest: how many of us are drowning in a sea of PDF textbooks? I certainly am. I’ve been trying to streamline my studying, heavily relying on digital highlighters – a glorious rainbow of knowledge, right? But here's the frustrating part: finding what I highlighted! 

I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day where someone was asking for a note-taking app that lets you search by highlighter color. Seriously, a game-changer! It feels like such an obvious feature in 2022, but it’s surprisingly hard to find. Any recommendations out there? My brain (and my highlighted PDFs) would be eternally grateful.
