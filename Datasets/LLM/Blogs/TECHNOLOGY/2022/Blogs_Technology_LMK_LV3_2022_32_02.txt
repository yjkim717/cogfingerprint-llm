The dreaded "I'm locked out" moment - we've all been there. But what happens when the people who keep your IT infrastructure running are suddenly unable to access it? That's what happened to a small business in 2022 when both Active Directory administrators got locked out of their accounts. With no one to turn to, they were forced to scramble for a solution. The crisis highlighted the importance of having a dual-control emergency access plan in place for privileged accounts. Without it, the business was left vulnerable and at risk. Implementing a robust access management system with dual control can prevent such disasters. By doing so, you can ensure that your critical systems remain accessible, even when the unexpected happens. It's a lesson learned the hard way - don't wait until you're facing a similar crisis to take action.
