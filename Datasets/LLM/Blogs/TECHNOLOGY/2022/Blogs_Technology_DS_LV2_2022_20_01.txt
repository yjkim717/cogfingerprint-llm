### The Digital Migraine

It hit me again last Tuesday—the digital migraine.

It wasn’t a physical pain, but a sudden, overwhelming static in my brain. My phone was pinging with Slack alerts, my email tab had a relentless (12) notification, and three different news sites were auto-playing videos. My focus shattered. I was staring at a sentence I’d written, but the words had lost all meaning.

In 2022, our brains are the ultimate diagnostic tool, constantly running self-scans. And the symptoms are weird. That phantom buzz in your pocket when your phone is charging in the other room. The low-grade anxiety from seeing an unread count you can’t immediately clear. The inability to watch a full movie without checking your phone.

I’ve started to think of my phone as the ER. I rush to it with every question, every twinge of boredom, seeking a quick answer or a hit of dopamine. And like the blogger awaiting their neurologist, the “tests” always come back normal. No new vital emails. No world-altering messages. Just the same digital noise.

So, I’m trying to be my own specialist. I’m the neurologist for my own attention. It means scheduling deep work blocks like they’re critical appointments and declaring my evenings a “scan-free” zone. The diagnosis is clear: connection overload. The prescription? Intentional disconnection. It’s the hardest, most necessary tech habit I’m trying to build.
