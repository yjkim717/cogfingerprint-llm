## Wrestling with Whitespace: My React Native Web Adventure

Okay, so I’ve been diving deep into React Native for Web lately, trying to build a single codebase that works beautifully on mobile *and* desktop. It's been a fun challenge, but also a source of some unexpected frustrations!

Specifically, I ran into a weird issue with my drawer navigation. On mobile, it looked perfect. But when I scaled it up to desktop, the entire app felt stretched out, with huge margins eating up valuable screen real estate. 

Turns out, React Native’s default styling doesn't always translate seamlessly to the web. After a bit of digging (and a few Expo-related head-scratches!), I finally figured out a clever way to adjust those margins using some inline styles and conditional rendering. Small victory, but a reminder that cross-platform development is all about those little adjustments! Anyone else battling similar UI quirks?
