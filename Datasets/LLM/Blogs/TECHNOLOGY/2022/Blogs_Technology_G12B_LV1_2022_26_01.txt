>## The Gentle Art of Letting Go (of Tech)

It's funny how attached we get to our tech, isn't it? I've been wrestling with that feeling lately. My old Ryzen 7 2700X build, the one that powered me through so many late-night coding sessions and gaming marathons, is finally being retired. It was a beast back in 2018!
