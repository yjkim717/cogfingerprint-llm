As I volunteered at our local community center's soup kitchen in 2022, I realized that technology can be a powerful tool for making a difference. I started exploring simple, low-cost soup recipes online and discovered a wealth of resources. By leveraging digital platforms, we were able to scale up our soup production, reduce food waste, and serve more people in need. It was a small tech hack that made a big impact.
