"The Anxiety of Waiting: When Technology Can't Ease the Mind"

As I sit here in 2022, surrounded by the latest gadgets and advancements in medical technology, I'm reminded that even with all the progress we've made, some things remain frustratingly unchanged. I'm waiting for a PCP appointment and specialist consultation to diagnose a potential case of hydrocephalus, and the uncertainty is taking a toll on my mental health. Worsening neurological symptoms like headaches, tingling, and confusion have become my unwelcome companions. The delay in diagnosis is fueling my anxiety, making it hard to focus on anything else. In a world where technology has made it possible to access vast amounts of information and connect with others instantly, I'm struck by the limitations of the healthcare system. As I navigate this challenging time, I'm learning to be patient and trust that the right diagnosis and treatment will come.
