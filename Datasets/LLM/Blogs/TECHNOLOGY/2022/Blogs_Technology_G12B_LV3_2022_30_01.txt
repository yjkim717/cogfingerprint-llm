## The Unexpected Credit Card & a Digital Dilemma

Okay, so this happened to me recently, and I figured some of you might relate. I somehow ended up with a Walgreens credit card. Somehow! I vaguely remember a signup offer at the checkout, a distracted click, and *poof* – a credit card appeared in the mail. 

It's 2022, and we're all juggling so many digital accounts and loyalty programs; it's easy to miss these things. The thing is, it doesn't have an annual fee, and I've heard keeping older accounts open can be good for your credit score. But do I *really* need another card? Ugh, the decision paralysis is real. I’m over here weighing the potential credit score boost against the sheer mental clutter of managing yet another account. Anyone else ever accidentally acquire a credit card? What did you do?
