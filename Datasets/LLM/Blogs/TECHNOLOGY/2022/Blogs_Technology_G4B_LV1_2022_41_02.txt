**Chasing Pixels and Pokémon: A LineageOS Experiment**

It’s weird, I know, but I’ve been completely consumed by a rather specific corner of the Android world lately. I’m seriously contemplating installing LineageOS on my old Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 – mostly to try and improve my Pokémon Go spoofing. Don’t judge! – and it’s made me think a lot about how we tinker with our devices. 

There’s this fascinating blend of wanting to push boundaries, tweak performance, and, let’s be honest, sometimes just mess around.  2022 feels like a year of “can I?” more than “should I?”  It’s a reminder that technology, at its core, is about experimentation.  I’m hoping this LineageOS dive will be a fun, if slightly obsessive, learning experience. Wish me luck!
