>Okay, here's a reflective blog post based on your prompt, aiming for a conversational, relatable tone and fitting the 2022 context. I've tried to weave in the feeling of student struggle while focusing on technology.

## The Blue Light & the Deadline: My Love-Hate Relationship with Productivity Apps

It's 2022, and I feel like half my life is spent staring at a screen. As an engineering student, that's probably not a huge surprise. Between lectures, problem sets, and the constant pressure to *just keep going*, my evenings often blur into a frantic cycle of coding and caffeine. 

I've tried everything to “hack” my productivity. Notion, Todoist, Forest… you name it, I've downloaded it, hoping for that elusive feeling of being *in control*. And sometimes, they work! There’s a brief, satisfying rush when I tick off a task, a digital pat on the back.

But honestly? Lately, I've been feeling… drained. The constant notifications, the pressure to optimize every minute, the guilt when I *don’t* use the app – it’s a lot. I'm starting to wonder if chasing this hyper-productive ideal is actually making things worse. Maybe a little less digital hustle and a little more actual rest is what I need. Anyone else feeling this digital burnout? Let’s commiserate!

**Notes on why I wrote it this way:**

*   **Relatable Opening:** Starts with a common experience (screen time) in 2022.
*   **Specific Detail:** Mentioning engineering provides a concrete context (linking back to your keywords).
*   **Conversational Tone:** Uses phrases like "you name it," "a lot," and "Let's commiserate!" to invite interaction.
*   **Reflective Question:** Ends with a question to encourage reader engagement.
*   **Acknowledges Both Sides:** Doesn't demonize technology, but explores the downsides of over-reliance.
