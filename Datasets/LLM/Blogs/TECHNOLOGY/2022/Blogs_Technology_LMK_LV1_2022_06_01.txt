As I dove back into Fallout 4 in 2022, I was determined to experience it at its best on my shiny new high-refresh-rate monitor. But, I was plagued by mouse lag and crashes when pushing for a silky-smooth 60fps. I tried tweaking vsync and capping my frame rate, but the perfect combo remained elusive. After some trial and error, I finally found a setup that worked - no more lag, no more crashes. If you're a fellow Fallout 4 enthusiast struggling with the same issues, I'm happy to share my hard-won solution with you.
