It’s 2022, and I’m staring at a screen full of charts, feeling like a detective in a digital world. I was analyzing some market data for a stock, and the patterns were just… off. The price would spike, then plummet, all on these tiny, questionable trades. It was a masterclass in how technology can be a double-edged sword.

On one hand, I have access to real-time data and algorithms that my predecessors could only dream of. On the other, that same tech empowers others to create these ghostly ripples—tiny manipulations in the bid/ask spread that can spook an entire market.

It made me reflect: our tools are smarter, but the game remains deeply human. The rush to react, the fear of missing out, the gut feeling that something isn't right. Technology hasn't changed the market's soul; it's just given us a faster, more complex mirror to see our own impulses reflected back at us.
