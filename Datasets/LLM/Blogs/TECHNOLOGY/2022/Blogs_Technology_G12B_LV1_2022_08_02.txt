>## The Algorithm and My Sanity: A Job Search Reflection

Okay, let's be honest, 2022 has been… a year. And for me, a large chunk of it has been spent staring at a screen, refreshing LinkedIn, and bracing for the inevitable "we've decided to move forward with other candidates." It’s a brutal cycle. You craft the perfect cover letter, tailor your resume, and pour your heart into an interview, only to be met with silence or, worse, a polite rejection.

It’s easy to get swallowed by the technology of it all. LinkedIn, the job boards, the automated applicant tracking systems – they feel impersonal, like you’re just a data point being assessed by an algorithm. And when that algorithm consistently spits you out, it really does a number on your self-worth.

I've been trying to remember that behind those rejection emails are *people*. Real people making tough decisions. And more importantly, I've been trying to prioritize my mental health. Daily walks, disconnecting from the screen, and reminding myself that my value isn’t tied to a job offer. It's a work in progress, but I’m determined to navigate this digital job search without losing myself in the process.
