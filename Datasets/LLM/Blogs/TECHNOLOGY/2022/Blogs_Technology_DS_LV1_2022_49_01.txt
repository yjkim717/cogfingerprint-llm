In 2022, I landed a new tech role with a 30% salary bump. I was thrilled—until the 3 a.m. Slack pings started. Suddenly, I was nostalgic for my old job, where the pay was modest but my evenings were my own.

I’ve realized salary is just one piece of the puzzle. Total compensation includes your peace of mind, your sleep, and the energy you have left for life outside work. A bigger number on your paycheck can come with invisible costs.

Now, I weigh job difficulty and work-life balance just as heavily as the offer letter. Because true career happiness isn’t funded by burnout.
