## The Ghost in the Machine (and My Old Calculator)

Remember the TI-84 Plus? Mine saw me through calculus, a faithful friend. Lately, I’ve been seeing posts online about loading ROMs onto graphing calculators – a bit like giving an old device a digital upgrade. It got me thinking about how we breathe new life into tech, even when it's long past its prime. A little spooky, maybe, but also pretty cool!
