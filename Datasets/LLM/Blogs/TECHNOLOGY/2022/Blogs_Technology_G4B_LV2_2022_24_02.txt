**The 4 AM Alarm & the Weight of the Commute**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt… heavy. Not just because of everything happening in the world, but because of *my* commute. As an engineering student, I was battling a seriously brutal daily slog to university – an hour each way. It started eating into everything. 

I remember nights spent scrolling, trying to squeeze in just *one* more thing, convinced I could optimize my time. But then, the exhaustion hit. Really hit. I was perpetually battling commuting fatigue, and it was directly impacting my sleep. 

Suddenly, prioritizing sleep felt like a radical act. It wasn’t about laziness; it was about recognizing that a drained brain wasn’t going to ace those exams. It was a tough lesson, but one I’m still learning.  Anyone else feel this struggle?
