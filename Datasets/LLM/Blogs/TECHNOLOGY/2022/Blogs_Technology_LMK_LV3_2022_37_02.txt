"When I grabbed my Aliexpress Xbone controller to dive into Stranger of Paradise FFO, I was in for a surprise. The button mapping was off, throwing off my gaming rhythm. As a gamer, it's frustrating when tech doesn't cooperate. This experience made me realize that even with affordable alternatives, compatibility can be a gamble. Now, I'm more cautious when choosing controller settings for a seamless gaming experience."
