**The Quiet Shame of Seeing It Online**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a little square of glass can suddenly feel like a pressure cooker? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with something that’s been bubbling up in my own community – and it started with a disturbing video I stumbled across online. It was about “g-checking,” essentially public shaming and intimidation of someone based on a minor infraction. 

Honestly, it felt… pathetic. Like a really sad, desperate attempt to exert control. I’ve seen it happen a few times, this kind of orchestrated pile-on, and each time it leaves a lingering taste of disappointment. It’s not about justice; it’s about dominance. 

We live in a world where everyone has a platform, a megaphone to broadcast their opinions – and sometimes, their judgment. But that doesn’t give us the right to tear people down. It actively undermines the sense of respect and trust that’s vital for a healthy community. 

I think we’re so quick to point fingers online, to label and condemn, that we’ve forgotten the basic human need for connection and understanding.  It felt like a stark reminder that behind every profile picture, there’s a real person, deserving of kindness and empathy.  Maybe 2022 needs to be the year we consciously choose to build, not break, each other down. What do you think?
