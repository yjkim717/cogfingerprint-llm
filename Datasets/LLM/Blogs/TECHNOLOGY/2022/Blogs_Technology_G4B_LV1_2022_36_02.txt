**YouTube Blues: When Your Browser Just Won’t Cooperate**

Okay, confession time: I spent a solid afternoon wrestling with Firefox last month. I was using the latest version (108.0.1, if you’re curious) and YouTube just… wouldn’t load. I’d deactivated every extension, even tried a full reinstall of Firefox on my Windows 11 machine. It felt like a digital ghost trying to haunt my screen! 

Seriously frustrating. It’s amazing how reliant we’ve become on seamless online experiences, and when something basic like YouTube breaks, it throws a real wrench in the works.  Anyone else had a similar tech meltdown recently?
