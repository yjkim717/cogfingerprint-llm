Of course, here is a reflective blog post from 2022.

### The App I Almost Deleted

It’s 2022, and I was ready to break up with my to-do list app. The frustration was real. It felt clunky, and I’d found a shiny new one everyone was raving about. I was moments from hitting “uninstall,” my finger hovering over the button.

But then I hesitated. I’d been with this app for years. I scrolled through my archived lists and found project notes from 2020, a grocery list from my first solo apartment, and even a forgotten goal I’d since achieved. This wasn't just a piece of software; it was a digital diary of my growth.

The old app wasn’t perfect, but it held my history. The new one might be sleeker, but it would be a blank slate. I realized the value wasn't just in the features, but in the story it already contained. Sometimes, the necessary tool isn’t the flashiest—it’s the one that’s seen you through the messy, real work of living. I kept it.
