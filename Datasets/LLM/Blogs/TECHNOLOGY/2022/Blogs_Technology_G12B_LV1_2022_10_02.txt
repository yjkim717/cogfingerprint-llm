## The Ghosts in My Guitar Rig

It’s funny the things that linger, aren’t they? I recently dusted off an old Line 6 Pod XT – a relic from my early 2000s guitar obsession. I remembered the thrill of that thing, the endless tweaking of amp models and effects, the feeling of finally having a wall of sound at my fingertips. 

But revisiting it in 2022 proved… challenging. 

See, I’m a Mac guy through and through. But getting this vintage piece of gear to play nice with my modern setup? Forget about it. Driver conflicts, compatibility errors… it was a digital nightmare. I spent a frustrating afternoon wrestling with it, eventually conceding defeat and borrowing a friend's Windows 10 machine. 

Suddenly, the update process was smooth. It felt like I was appeasing some digital ghost, a requirement from a bygone era of computing. 

It made me think about all the tech we accumulate – the devices that become obsolete, the software that refuses to cooperate. It’s a reminder that progress isn't always linear, and sometimes, the path forward requires a detour through the past. Now, at least, my Pod XT is humming along, a quirky time capsule in my signal chain.
