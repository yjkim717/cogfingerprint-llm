"Frustrating Firefox woes! I was having a rough morning in 2022 when YouTube just wouldn't load on my browser. I tried reinstalling Firefox and even deleted the AppData, but nothing worked. Other websites loaded fine, so I knew it wasn't my internet connection. I was stumped. As a tech enthusiast, I was determined to get to the bottom of it. After some digging, I discovered it was a browser issue specific to Mozilla Firefox. If you're experiencing the same problem, you're not alone. Has anyone else had a similar issue with Firefox and YouTube?"
