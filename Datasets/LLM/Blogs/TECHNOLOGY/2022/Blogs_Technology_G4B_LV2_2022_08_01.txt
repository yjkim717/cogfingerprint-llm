**Lost in the Time Zones: My Tech-Fueled Jetlag Blues**

Okay, confession time: 2022 was a *year* of travel. Europe, glorious Europe! But as someone who tends to lean into intense focus, the whole “jetlag” thing hit me hard. I’m not neurotypical, and Asperger’s definitely amplified the disorientation – it felt like my internal clock was stuck in a permanent loop. 

I started relying heavily on my smartwatch, tracking sleep patterns obsessively. Ironically, the *more* I tried to control it with technology, the worse it got. It made me realize sometimes, disconnecting and just… letting go, is the best recovery strategy.  Anyone else find tech adds to the travel chaos?
