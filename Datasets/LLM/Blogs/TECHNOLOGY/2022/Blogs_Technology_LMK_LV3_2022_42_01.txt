"As I built my React Native app for web using Expo in 2022, I hit a snag - making it look great on desktop screens. With Drawer navigation, I struggled to add left and right margins for a more responsive design. After some trial and error, I discovered a simple solution. By wrapping my content in a View with a max-width and using flexbox to center it, I achieved a clean and modern look. This small tweak significantly improved my app's desktop appearance, and I'm excited to share this hack with fellow developers."
