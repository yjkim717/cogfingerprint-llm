**Melbourne, Sausage Rolls, and Seriously Weird Vibes**

Right, so I’m back. Officially back in Melbourne after a glorious, chaotic few months in Japan. And let me tell you, stepping off the plane felt… strange. It’s that weird reverse culture shock thing, isn’t it? Like your brain’s still running on Tokyo time. 

I’d spent months navigating incredibly strict COVID rules – masks everywhere, social distancing, pre-booked everything. Then, BAM, Melbourne. Suddenly, people are crammed into cafes, ordering sausage rolls with gusto, and generally just… existing. It’s a sensory overload! 

I’ve been spending a lot of time just observing, trying to recalibrate.  Part of me misses the quiet order of Japan, the hyper-organized public transport. But there’s a real vibrancy here, a delicious, slightly messy energy.  I'm even starting to enjoy the sausage rolls.  It’s a reminder that even after a huge shift, it’s okay to feel a little lost – and maybe even a little excited – about finding your way back.
