"Rebooting My Life: Navigating the Post-COVID Tech Landscape"

As I stepped off the plane in Melbourne in 2022, I felt like a relic from another era. After years of living abroad during COVID, I was hit with a wave of reverse culture shock. Everything felt foreign, from the crowded public transport to the casual chats with strangers about the latest sausage roll obsession at the local bakery. But it was the tech landscape that really threw me. I was used to navigating the world with a different set of digital tools, and it took me a while to adjust to the new normal. As I settled back into my routine, I realized that my relationship with technology had changed. I was more mindful of my screen time, and I had developed a new appreciation for the simple things in life. It was time to reboot my digital habits and find a new balance in this post-COVID world.
