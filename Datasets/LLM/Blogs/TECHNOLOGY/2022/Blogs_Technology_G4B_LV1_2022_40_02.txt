**Lost in the Stars? Maybe We Need a Little Help**

Okay, let’s be honest. I’ve spent *way* too much time wandering around Star Citizen lately, completely bewildered by the sheer scale of it all. It’s gorgeous, brilliant, and utterly overwhelming for someone just starting out. I remember that feeling – the desperate desire to just *understand* how everything works. 

It got me thinking about how much smoother the onboarding experience could be for games like Destiny and, honestly, a lot of other sprawling online worlds. What if there was a gentle hand, a digital “Guiding Light”? 

I’m picturing something like a volunteer-run system, maybe integrated through Discord, connecting new players with experienced volunteers. Like a bespoke tour guide, offering tailored advice and answering those frustrating, repetitive questions. 

It’s not about holding your hand, of course. But a little support, a little shared knowledge, could really shift the dynamic and make the galaxy feel a bit less daunting.  Wouldn't that be amazing?  What do you think?
