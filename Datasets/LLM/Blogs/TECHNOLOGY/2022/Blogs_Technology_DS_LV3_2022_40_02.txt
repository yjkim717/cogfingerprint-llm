It’s funny how a single moment can shift your perspective on something you thought you understood. For me, that moment came in late 2022, while I was watching a friend try to get into *Destiny 2* for the first time. I’d been playing for years, but seeing it through his eyes was a revelation. He was lost. The sheer scale of systems, the unspoken community knowledge—it was a wall, not a welcome mat.

I remember thinking about the guides and YouTube videos I’d consumed years ago, the silent pact we make as players to teach each other outside the game itself. And then I thought of Star Citizen’s Guide System. It’s this brilliant, official framework that lets experienced players volunteer as in-game mentors. They don’t just moderate chats; they actively reach out, answer questions in real-time, and help new pilots navigate the vastness of space.

What if Destiny had that? An official, in-game channel to connect a new Guardian feeling overwhelmed with a community volunteer who’s been there. It wouldn’t just be about reducing confusion; it would be about building bridges from day one. Instead of a cold, automated tutorial, you’d get a human connection—a veteran saying, “Hey, I see you’re struggling with this mission. Let me show you a trick.”

This isn’t just about quality-of-life features. It’s about the soul of a live-service game. True accessibility isn’t just colorblind modes and adjustable UI; it’s about making the community itself accessible. An expert guide system formalizes the best part of our culture—the willingness to help—and weaves it directly into the fabric of the game. It turns a sprawling, intimidating universe into a place you can confidently call home.
