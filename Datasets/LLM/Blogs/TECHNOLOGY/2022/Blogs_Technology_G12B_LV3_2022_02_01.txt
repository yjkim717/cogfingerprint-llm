## Where Did My Voicemail Go? A Little iPhone Frustration

Okay, I need to vent for a minute. I upgraded to the iPhone 13 last fall (2022), thrilled as always with the new camera and speed. But there’s this little thing that’s been bugging me – my voicemail. I used to *love* the seamless integration on my older iPhones (I’ve been an iPhone user since the 11!), especially when I was on a different carrier. The transcribed messages, the easy management…gone! Now, on Verizon, it’s just… clunky. It feels like a step backward. Anyone else experiencing this? It’s a small thing, but it’s definitely a reminder that not every upgrade is perfect.
