"As tech professionals, we often chase higher salaries, but is it worth the trade-off? I'm not just talking about the long hours or demanding deadlines. I'm talking about the toll it takes on our work-life balance and overall job satisfaction. In 2022, the tech industry is booming, but are we sacrificing our well-being for a fatter paycheck? I've seen colleagues thrive in challenging roles, but also burn out. Is a higher salary a fair compensation for increased stress and pressure? It's a question I'm still grappling with, and one that I think many of us need to consider."
