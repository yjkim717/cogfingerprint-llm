"As I dusted off my old Line 6 Pod XT, I couldn't help but wonder if it still had a place in my 2022 music setup. I'd heard horror stories about older tech being left behind, and I was concerned that its compatibility with newer Mac OS versions might be a challenge. After some digging, I discovered that while the Pod XT is still a beast of an amp sim, getting it to play nice with modern computers requires some creative problem-solving. I've come across a few enterprising souls online who've managed to hack together workarounds, including using the Line 6 Monkey to update the device's firmware. It's heartening to see that with a bit of tinkering, this old gem can still be coaxed into working with the latest Mac OS. For now, the Pod XT is staying in my rig â€“ a testament to the ingenuity of the music tech community."
