As I dive into my PDF textbooks this semester, I'm on the hunt for the ultimate note-taking app. I'm tired of sifting through pages of highlighted text, trying to recall the key points I annotated in yellow versus green. My ideal app would let me search by highlighter color, making it a breeze to review material. With the rise of digital learning in 2022, I'm not alone in seeking a tool that streamlines my study routine. Is there an app out there that can help me colour-code my way to academic success?
