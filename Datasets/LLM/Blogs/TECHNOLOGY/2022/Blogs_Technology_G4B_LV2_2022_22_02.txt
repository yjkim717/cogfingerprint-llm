**The Day My Robot Broke Down (And My Budget Did Too)**

Let me tell you, 2022 felt like a year of shiny new tech – until my little home assistant decided to stage a full-blown rebellion. A simple “broken bolt” turned into a cascade of “spring bush” issues and, honestly, a seriously expensive repair. It wasn't just the cost of the replacement parts; it was the sheer frustration of navigating the replacement process. 

It really made me think about how reliant we’ve become on these complex systems, and how easily they can throw a wrench – or a bolt – into our carefully planned lives.  Anyone else had a similar tech meltdown this year?
