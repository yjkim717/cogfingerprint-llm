"When Code Gets Too Hot to Handle"

I still recall the 2022 coding workshop where I learned a valuable lesson about handling "hot" code - not literally, but figuratively. A colleague, excited to dive into a project involving complex algorithms, reused his gloves - not coding gloves, but the kind you wear when working with spicy ingredients. Unbeknownst to him, his gloves had previously been used to handle ghost peppers. As he began typing away, the capsaicin residue on his gloves transferred to his eyes, causing a burning sensation. We all burst out laughing at the unexpected mishap. The experience taught me that just as we need to handle spicy ingredients with care, we must also approach complex code with caution and attention to detail. By doing so, we can avoid "burning" ourselves and create a smoother development process.
