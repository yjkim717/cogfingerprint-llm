**The Quiet Hum of Worry**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we become tethered to our devices, seeking answers and validation in the glow of a screen. Lately, I’ve been noticing a persistent, low-level hum of anxiety, a sort of digital restlessness. It started subtly – scrolling endlessly, comparing myself to perfectly curated Instagram feeds. 

Then came the headaches, a dull throb that seemed to intensify with each notification. I found myself obsessively researching symptoms online, fueled by a creeping fear, not unlike the worry a Reddit user might have about something neurological.  It’s a strange echo of that feeling, isn’t it?  We’re so connected, yet sometimes desperately alone with our concerns.  I’m trying to step back, and just *be*, without the constant pull of the digital world.
