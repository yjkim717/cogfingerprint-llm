**The Great Job Hunt & The Vacation Question**

2022 felt like a year of pivots, didn't it? I was constantly refreshing job boards, sending out applications – basically, a full-blown job hunt. And amidst all the excitement, a surprisingly persistent question popped up: “How many vacation days do you need?” 

It wasn't just about the number, really. It was about feeling secure, about having a little breathing room to recharge. I spent ages negotiating with potential employers, trying to figure out what “normal” looked like.  It made me realize how much we undervalue time off, especially in this always-on tech world.  Anyone else feel me on this?
