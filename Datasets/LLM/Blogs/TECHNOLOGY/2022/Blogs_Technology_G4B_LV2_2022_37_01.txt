**The Button Blues: Why My Controller Choices Matter**

Okay, let’s be honest – sometimes tech feels less about innovation and more about… buttons. Specifically, *which* buttons and how they make a game *feel*. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with this, and it's surprisingly personal. 

I’m a sucker for fighting games, you know? But I've noticed a frustrating trend: so many games just don’t translate the PlayStation prompts – the little light flashes that tell you what button to press – to the Xbox controller. It’s a tiny thing, but it throws me completely. 

I spent a good chunk of last week researching the DualSense and DS4, trying to find a controller that felt… right. It’s weird, isn’t it? We’re so used to these complex machines, but a small difference in button layout can completely change the experience. 

Maybe it’s just me, but it feels like a little piece of the game is lost when those familiar prompts are missing. What about you? What controller quirks drive you crazy?
