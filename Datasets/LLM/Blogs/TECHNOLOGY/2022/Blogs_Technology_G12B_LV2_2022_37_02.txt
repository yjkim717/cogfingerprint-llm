## When Tech Just...Doesn't Quite Click

Okay, so I’ve been diving back into *Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin*, and I'm having a weird time. My Xbox controller works perfectly fine in everything else – Forza, Halo, you name it. But in this game? Certain buttons have *double* functions. It's baffling! 

It's a small thing, I know, but it's got me thinking about how we expect seamless integration with technology. We assume it *just works*. And when it doesn't, that little disconnect can be surprisingly frustrating. It’s a reminder that even with all our advancements, tech can still throw curveballs. Anyone else ever have that “huh?” moment with a game or device?
