**The Scroll and the Sleep Deprivation**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt… exhausting. I was a university student juggling a ridiculous commute – an hour each way – and desperately trying to carve out enough sleep.  I was glued to my phone, doomscrolling through news and social media, trying to fill the endless hours.  It felt productive, right? Wrong. 

I was running on fumes, battling a constant, low-level fatigue that bled into my classes and my mood. My energy was shot, and honestly, my mental health took a serious hit.  I realized I was using technology to *avoid* feeling tired, instead of finding ways to actually combat it. 

There’s a weird paradox, isn’t there? We’re supposed to be connected *because* technology offers connection, but it also steals our time and drains our energy.  It made me rethink my relationship with my devices – a much-needed digital detox, if you will.  Anyone else feeling this pull?
