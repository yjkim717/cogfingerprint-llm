**The Spreadsheet Struggle (and Why I Finally Embraced My Bank)**

Okay, real talk. Last year, I was *deep* in spreadsheet territory when it came to personal finance. Every single transaction record, painstakingly entered and then… categorized with a color-coded system that only *I* understood. It felt impressive, sure, but also exhausting. 

I’m a bit of a control freak, I admit. But then I started browsing Reddit – a fellow Redditor was asking about simplifying spending tracking. And it hit me: my bank website has *everything*! 

Now, I’m using SQL queries (don't worry, I'm just *looking* at them!) to automatically classify my transactions. It’s shockingly easy, and honestly, freeing. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most powerful tools are already at our fingertips.  Anyone else ditching the spreadsheets for digital simplicity?
