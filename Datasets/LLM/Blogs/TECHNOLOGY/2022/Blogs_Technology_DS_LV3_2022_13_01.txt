It’s 2022, and I’m a web developer in Canada running my own *auto-entreprise*. When a French client reached out, I was thrilled—until they asked for my SIRET number. I didn’t have one, and the panic set in. How could I handle payments and formalities from overseas?

Turns out, you don’t always need a SIRET to collaborate internationally. After some research, I found straightforward payment platforms and drafted clear invoices with my Canadian business details. It was a reminder that in our connected world, borders are less about barriers and more about bridges—if you’re willing to navigate them. Sometimes, the biggest hurdles are just paperwork and a little bit of courage.
