It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my high-refresh monitor, wondering why Fallout 4 feels like wading through molasses. I’d dreamed of buttery 60fps in the Commonwealth, but instead, I got crashes, mouse lag, and that stubborn vsync refusing to cooperate. It’s funny—we chase these tech upgrades for immersion, only to spend hours tweaking .ini files like digital alchemists. Each fix felt like a small victory, a quiet triumph in a battle against invisible code gremlins. In the end, it wasn’t just about smoother frames; it was the stubborn joy of making something work, against all odds.
