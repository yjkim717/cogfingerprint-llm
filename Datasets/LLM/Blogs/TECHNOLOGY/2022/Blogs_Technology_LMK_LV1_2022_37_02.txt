"I'm still fuming about my Stranger of Paradise FFO experience on my xbone knockoff controller. Despite tweaking controller settings, the button mapping was all wrong. I switched control types, re-mapped buttons, and even tried different configurations, but nothing worked. It was a frustrating 2022 gaming moment. Has anyone else had similar issues with this game and a non-official xbox controller? I'm still searching for a solution."
