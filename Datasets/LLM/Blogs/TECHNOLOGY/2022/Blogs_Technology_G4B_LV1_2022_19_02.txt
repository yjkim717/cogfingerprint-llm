**The Algorithm of Worry**

Okay, so 2022 feels like a year of learning to *not* control everything, honestly. It started with moving in with Chloe and her mom, Sarah. Sarah’s lovely, genuinely wants to help, but she’s... a lot. Like, a *lot* of offers. “Should you try this tea? Let me just adjust the thermostat!” It’s triggering something deep, you know? 

I realized it was connected to this weird anxiety I’ve always had – a need to manage, to predict, to keep things ‘just so.’ It’s probably rooted in my childhood, a constant feeling of needing to be in control, which honestly never really worked. 

And then, it bled into my tech life. I’d meticulously schedule everything in Google Calendar, color-code my to-do lists, and feel this surge of relief when everything was…perfect.  I even started using those habit-tracking apps, obsessively checking off each little task. 

It hit me – I was letting an algorithm dictate my peace.  Chloe gently suggested I just *let things be*.  It’s a conscious effort now, to step back from the digital control and embrace a little chaos.  It’s terrifying, but also… strangely freeing.
