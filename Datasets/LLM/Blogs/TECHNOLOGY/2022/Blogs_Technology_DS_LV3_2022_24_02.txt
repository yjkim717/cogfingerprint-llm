The alarm screams at 5:15 AM. My laptop, still warm from last night’s coding marathon, sits beside me like a guilty conscience. This is the reality of my 2022: a brutal two-hour commute each way to engineering school.

I used to think technology would save me—streaming lectures on the train, debugging on my phone. But the constant motion and screen glare are a different kind of drain. By the time I get to campus, my brain feels like a processor throttled by heat. The toughest calculation isn't the physics problem on my screen; it's the nightly trade-off. Do I sacrifice another hour of precious sleep to understand this algorithm, or do I close my eyes and hope I can just pass?

The fatigue is a silent tax on my education, paid in yawns and caffeine.
