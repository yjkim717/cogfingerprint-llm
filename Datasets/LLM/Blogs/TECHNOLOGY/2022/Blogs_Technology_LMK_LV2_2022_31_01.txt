"As we dive into the world of cell biology in 2022, I'm struck by the complexity of proteins. We know genes code for them, but what about the rest? Post-translational modifications and chemical reactions play a huge role. It's like a masterclass in customization - the proteome is shaped by more than just genes. This got me thinking, what's the real proportion of proteins not directly coded by genes? The answer might just redefine our understanding of protein function."
