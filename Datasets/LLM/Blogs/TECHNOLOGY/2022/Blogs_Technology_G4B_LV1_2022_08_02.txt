**The Scroll & The Soul**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 felt like a year of endless LinkedIn scrolling. I was applying for jobs *religiously*, crafting cover letters that felt robotic, and then… the rejections started piling up. It’s brutal, right?  Each “not at this time” felt like a little punch to the gut.

It hit me – the digital world can be a fantastic tool, but it’s easy to let it steal your energy. I started prioritizing walks, actually *talking* to people, and reminding myself that one rejection doesn’t define my worth.  It’s a constant balancing act, isn’t it?
