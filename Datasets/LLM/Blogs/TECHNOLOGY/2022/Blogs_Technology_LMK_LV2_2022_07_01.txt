As I scroll through my feeds in 2022, I'm struck by the irony of sustainable clothing entrepreneurs struggling to stay afloat. Despite the growing awareness of climate impact, smaller eco-friendly brands are still finding it tough to gain traction. One such entrepreneur is selling sustainable items at cost online, simply to keep their business alive. It's a harsh reminder that our digital platforms, while powerful, aren't always conducive to supporting the values we claim to care about. Can we rethink our online spaces to prioritize the planet, too?
