**The Unexpected Burn of the Algorithm**

Okay, so 2022 was… a lot, right? I dove headfirst into optimizing my entire workflow with new AI tools – basically, outsourcing almost every repetitive task. It felt amazing at first, like a super-efficient productivity boost. But then, last week, I started getting this *weird* hand pain. 

Turns out, I’d been reusing the same glove – the one I used for keyboard cleaning – after it’d been handling the output from a particularly aggressive data scrubbing algorithm. Seriously, the thing was practically vibrating with digital spice! 

It was a bizarre, almost physical reminder that even the most ‘invisible’ technologies can have a real impact.  We’re so focused on speed and automation, we forget to consider the consequences of our digital interactions.  Maybe it's time to clean my tools too.
