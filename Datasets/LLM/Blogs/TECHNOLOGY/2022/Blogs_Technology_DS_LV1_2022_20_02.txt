### **Original Text Inspired by the Medical Summary**

The world has started to feel like it’s wrapped in thick, muffling cotton. It began with the headaches—not your average tension headache, but a deep, persistent pressure that feels like my skull is slowly filling with cement. Then came the mental fog, a confusion so profound I sometimes forget a task midway through a sentence. My fingers have begun to tingle with a strange, persistent numbness.

My primary doctor, after reviewing my MRI, used words I had to look up later: "ventricles prominent." The radiologist’s report suggested it could be hydrocephalus, a dangerous buildup of fluid in the brain. They’ve ordered an MRI with contrast for a clearer picture, and the wait for my neurologist appointment next month feels like an eternity. Every new wave of dizziness, every moment of confusion, is a terrifying question mark. I’m trapped in this limbo, trying to manage these worsening neurological symptoms while the calendar ticks down, hoping for answers before things get any worse.

### **The Unplanned Digital Detox (2022)**

It’s funny how a single, stupid moment can reset your entire perspective. For me, it was dropping my phone face-down on the pavement last week. The screen didn’t just crack; it died completely, a spiderweb of black obliterating my portal to the world.

The first 24 hours were filled with a low-grade panic. I felt phantom vibrations in my pocket and an urge to “just check” something—anything. But as the days passed, a strange quiet settled in. Without the constant pull of notifications and the infinite scroll, I started noticing things. I read an entire book in one sitting for the first time in years. I had long, meandering conversations with my partner without either of us glancing at a screen.

It made me realize that in 2022, our technology isn’t just a tool; it’s the environment. We’re swimming in it, and we don’t notice the current until we’re suddenly pulled ashore. My new phone arrives tomorrow, but this unplanned digital detox taught me a valuable lesson: I need to be the one who decides when to dive in and when to climb out and just breathe.
