"To Test or Not to Test: The Great Package Debate"

As I sat down with my colleague to discuss our latest Go project, the conversation turned to a topic that's sparked debate among developers for years: where to put our test code. Should it live alongside our implementation code in the same package, or be cordoned off in a separate test package? My colleague argued that keeping tests together with the code they're testing makes it easier to catch errors and ensures everything is working as expected. I countered that separating tests into their own package promotes a cleaner code organization and forces us to test our code through its public API, just like any other consumer. As we weighed the pros and cons, I realized that this debate isn't just about code structure - it's about our approach to testing and the principles that guide our development practices in 2022.
