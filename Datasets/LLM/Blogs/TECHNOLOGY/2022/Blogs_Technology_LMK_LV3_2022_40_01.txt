"As I set up my Linux media streaming box, I realized I needed a more streamlined way to control it from across the room. Ditching the clutter of a full keyboard and mouse, I started exploring minimal alternatives. With i3wm as my window manager and Wayland providing a seamless display experience, I discovered a world of remote control possibilities. Now, I can effortlessly navigate my media library and enjoy my favorite shows with just a few keystrokes, making for a more relaxed viewing experience."
