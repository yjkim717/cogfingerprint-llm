The endless scroll. We've all been there - mindlessly swiping through social media, comparing our coding skills to that one developer who seems to have it all together. I was there too, feeling like I wasn't good enough, until I caught myself. I realized that I was comparing my behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel. As a hobbyist programmer in 2022, I've come to understand that the constant pursuit of being the "best" can be crippling. My journey with coding, much like my experiences with other hobbies like dancing and playing guitar, has taught me the importance of mindfulness. By focusing on my own progress, rather than measuring myself against others, I've found a sense of joy and fulfillment. I've learned to appreciate the small wins, and that's what keeps me coming back to the screen, eager to learn and improve.
