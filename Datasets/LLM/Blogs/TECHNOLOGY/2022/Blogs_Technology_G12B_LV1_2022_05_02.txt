## The Algorithm Knows My Sausage Roll Preference (And That’s… Weird?)

Okay, so I'm back. Back from a stint overseas, and honestly, the reverse culture shock is hitting harder than I anticipated. It’s not just the driving on the left, or the sheer volume of aggressively friendly dogs. It’s… the technology.

I spent six months in a place where contactless payment was practically mandatory. Everything was streamlined, efficient, and subtly tracked. Coming back to Australia in 2022, where cash still exists and queuing is a national pastime, felt like stepping into a time warp. 

But the *really* weird thing? The algorithms.

I mentioned to a friend I was craving a sausage roll and a vanilla slice. Just casually, in conversation. Now? My Instagram feed is flooded with bakeries, articles about the “perfect” pastry, and targeted ads for… you guessed it, sausage rolls and vanilla slices. 

It's unsettling. Like, I get it, data is king. But the level of personalization feels almost intrusive. I’m not even sure *how* it knew. Was it my friend's diligent social media sharing? Did my voice assistant overhear me? 

It’s a stark reminder that even the simplest craving, the most mundane desire, is now fuel for the digital machine. And honestly, I’m just trying to enjoy my pastry in peace. Maybe I'll unplug for a while.
