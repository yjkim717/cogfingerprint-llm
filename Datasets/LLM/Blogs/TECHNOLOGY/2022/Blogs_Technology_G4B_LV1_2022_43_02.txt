**Keeping Tests Separate: A 2022 Lesson in Go**

Okay, let’s be honest, staring at a tangled mess of testing code *inside* your Go packages is a nightmare. I hit that wall pretty hard last year while refactoring a project. It felt productive at the time, but it quickly became a maintenance headache. 

I realized I was blurring the lines between my actual code and how it was tested. That’s when I started seriously pushing for separate test packages.  

Now, I'm a huge fan of mocks – they’re fantastic for isolating units. But the real key is decoupling.  Designing tests around interfaces, rather than concrete implementations, makes them so much more flexible and reusable. Seriously, it’s a sanity saver.  Anyone else feel this way about test organization?
