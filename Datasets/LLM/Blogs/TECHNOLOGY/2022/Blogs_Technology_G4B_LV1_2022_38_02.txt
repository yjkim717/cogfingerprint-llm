**The Anxiety of the Algorithm**

Remember 2022? We were still navigating a world *shaped* by technology, especially when it came to travel. I vividly recall obsessing over those COVID-19 tests and the endless rules surrounding flight entry to the Netherlands. It felt like every decision was filtered through an algorithm – a negative test, then vaccine records… it was exhausting! 

It made me think about how much we trust these systems, how quickly we accept them as ‘normal’.  There’s a weird anxiety in letting technology dictate so much of our lives, isn’t there?  It’s a reminder to actually *feel* our way through the world, not just follow the digital prompt.
