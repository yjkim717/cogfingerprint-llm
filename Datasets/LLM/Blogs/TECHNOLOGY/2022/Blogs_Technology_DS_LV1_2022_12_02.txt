It’s funny—in 2022, I was back in Italy for a few weeks and tried using Poste Italiane’s Punti Poste for my eBay orders. I figured, why not lean into local tech? But the hiccups were real: navigating Ricapito services felt like decoding an ancient map. It reminded me that even in our hyper-connected world, convenience isn’t universal. Sometimes, the simplest digital solutions still trip over old-world logistics. A small lesson in patience, wrapped in a package slip.
