Breaking into the IT Industry: Lessons from Two Decades of Experience

As I sit here in 2022, reflecting on my 21-year journey in the IT industry, I'm reminded of the countless individuals I've met who are eager to break into this dynamic field. If you're one of them, you're likely wondering where to start. I'll share some hard-earned insights to help you navigate this exciting profession.

When I first started, the tech landscape was vastly different. The internet was still in its relative infancy, and cybersecurity wasn't the pressing concern it is today. Fast forward to now, and it's clear that the IT industry has evolved at a breakneck pace. Yet, despite these changes, some fundamental principles remain the same.

To succeed in IT, you need a willingness to learn and adapt continuously. The field is constantly evolving, with new technologies and innovations emerging all the time. My advice is to start by building a strong foundation in the basics â€“ programming, networking, and problem-solving. From there, explore areas that genuinely interest you, whether that's cybersecurity, data analytics, or cloud computing.

Don't be discouraged if you don't have a technical background. I've seen many successful IT professionals come from non-technical fields. What's more important is your attitude and dedication to learning. Seek out online courses, attend industry events, and connect with professionals in the field.

Breaking into the IT industry requires perseverance, curiosity, and a willingness to learn. By following these principles and staying committed to your goals, you can set yourself up for success in this rewarding and challenging profession.
