It’s 2022, and I’ve been reflecting on the trade-offs we make in tech. Last year, I landed a higher-paying role—the kind you brag about at parties. But behind the salary bump was a hidden cost: endless deadlines, constant pressure, and blurred lines between work and life.

I’d find myself answering Slack messages during dinner, my stress levels spiking with every notification. Sure, the money felt great, but was it worth sacrificing evenings with family and moments of quiet?

Now, I’m learning to redefine success. It’s not just about climbing the ladder or padding your bank account—it’s about preserving your peace and finding genuine career happiness. Because what good is a bigger paycheck if you’re too drained to enjoy it?
