### A Bold Blueprint for the Canucks' Offseason

As the dust settles on another season, it's time for the Vancouver Canucks to be proactive and creative in reshaping their roster. The path forward might require a difficult but necessary step: capitalizing on the value of a top-six winger like Brock Boeser or Conor Garland. Trading one of them for a package of futures—draft picks and promising prospects—would inject crucial cost-controlled talent and flexibility into the system.

The freed-up cap space should then be aggressively used to target a high-upside free agent. André Burakovsky, fresh from a Stanley Cup win and entering his prime, represents the perfect blend of size, skill, and scoring touch the Canucks' top-six needs.

Finally, with assets acquired from a trade, management should place a call to New York. The primary target? Braden Schneider. The young, physical, right-shot defenseman is the ideal, long-term partner for Quinn Hughes. His defensive stability would unleash Hughes’s full offensive potential, finally solving a years-long puzzle on the blue line. This three-part plan is a bold but coherent strategy to build a faster, deeper, and more balanced team for the future.

And here is a reflective blog post on technology for 2022.

### The Year We Stopped Just "Going Online"

Remember when "going online" was a thing? In 2022, that idea finally became a relic. This year, the digital and physical worlds didn't just overlap; they fused. My "Aha!" moment came when I found myself more comfortable in a client's custom-built metaverse conference room than in a laggy Zoom call. The shared sense of space, even a virtual one, changed the connection entirely.

It’s not just the metaverse. It’s the quiet integration of AI that writes my first drafts and the blockchain protocols I don't see but now trust with digital assets. The conversation has shifted. We're no longer asking *if* a technology works, but *how* it rewires our human experience. The frontier isn't about getting us online anymore; it's about building a world where the line between IRL and URL doesn't exist. And honestly? It's both thrilling and a little terrifying to watch it happen in real-time.
