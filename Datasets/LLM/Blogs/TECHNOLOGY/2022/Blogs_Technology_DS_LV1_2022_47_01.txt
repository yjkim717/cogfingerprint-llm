### The Rush: My Biggest Tech Mistake of 2022

It’s 2022, and I’m drowning in a sea of completed tickets. My monthly metrics are through the roof. I should feel like a rockstar, right? Instead, I’m in a meeting, my manager gently pointing to a graph of performance issues that perfectly mirrors my "productivity" spike.

The truth hit me hard. In my rush to prove my worth, I’d started treating my work like a fast-food order—quick, standardized, and ultimately unsatisfying. I was so focused on the *quantity* of tasks I closed that I completely neglected the *quality* of the work I was doing. A script deployed in five minutes would cause hours of headaches later. A "quick fix" would become a recurring nightmare for the support team.

I was competent, but I was careless. This year forced a brutal but necessary self-reflection. Speed is valuable, but a durable, well-considered solution will always win the race. Now, I take a deep breath before I code, asking not "How fast can I finish?" but "How well can I build this?" The difference has been night and day.
