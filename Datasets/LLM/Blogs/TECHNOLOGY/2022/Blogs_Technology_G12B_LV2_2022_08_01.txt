## My Apple Watch is Telling Me I'm *Really* Tired (and Maybe I Am)

Okay, so I'm back from a whirlwind trip through Europe, and something’s…off. I'm sleeping. A *lot*. Like, 11-12 hours a night. I figured jetlag was to blame, and the tons of walking definitely contributed, but even now, weeks later, it’s persisting. My Apple Watch is diligently tracking my "active calories" burned, and it's impressive, but it’s also highlighting just how much I'm *not* doing while awake. 

It got me thinking: are we so obsessed with tracking our activity that we miss the bigger picture? Maybe my body is just screaming for rest after all that hustle. Anyone else experiencing weird tech-fueled self-discovery lately?
