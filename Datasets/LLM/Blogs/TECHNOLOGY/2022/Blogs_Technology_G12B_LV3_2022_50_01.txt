>## The Unexpected Comfort of a Disconnected Weekend

It’s 2022, and we're *always* online, right? I realized this past weekend just how much I rely on my phone, and how draining it can be. A friend suggested a digital detox – a complete disconnect. Initially, I felt anxious, a little lost. But then… quiet. I rediscovered the joy of reading a physical book, actually *talking* to my family, and noticing the details around me. It wasn't about rejecting technology, but remembering there's a whole world thriving offline. A gentle reminder that sometimes, the best connection is with ourselves.
