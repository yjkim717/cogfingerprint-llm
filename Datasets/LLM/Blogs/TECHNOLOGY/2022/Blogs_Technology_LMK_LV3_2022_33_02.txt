It wasn't just me; friends and fellow users were experiencing the same issue with Vanced and NewPipe too. It's disheartening when tech glitches disrupt our online interactions. Has the convenience of YouTube come at the cost of reliability? Perhaps it's time to rethink our dependence on these platforms and explore alternative solutions."
