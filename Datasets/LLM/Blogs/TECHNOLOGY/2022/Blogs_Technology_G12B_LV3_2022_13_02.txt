It's 2022, and we entrust so much to our devices. Lately, I've been thinking about how vulnerable we are. A Blockfolio user recently shared a frustrating experience – an app glitch threatening all their manually tracked crypto data. It hit home.

A reminder that even with all this tech, a little backup plan is always a good idea.
