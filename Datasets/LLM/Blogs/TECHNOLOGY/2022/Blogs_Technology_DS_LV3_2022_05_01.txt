It was late 2022, and I was staring at my screen, my latest AI model humming quietly on my laptop. The NeurIPS workshop deadline was approaching, and a familiar question echoed in my mind: *Is this it? Is this paper my final word, or just the first step?*

I remembered a colleague who’d submitted a promising workshop paper to ICML, only to face scrutiny because their "preliminary" ideas were already public. The academic world can be a tricky landscape. A workshop can feel like a safe space to test the waters—to share raw, exciting concepts without the pressure of a full conference submission. But that early visibility is a double-edged sword. It’s a chance to get invaluable feedback, to connect with peers who are equally passionate, yet it also means your ideas are out there, potentially limiting where they can travel next.

Navigating this isn't about right or wrong answers; it's about intention. Are you seeking collaboration and early critique, or are you guarding a concept for a grander debut? Understanding the unwritten rules of each venue is the real key to turning those initial drafts into something lasting.
