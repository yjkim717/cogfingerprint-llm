## The Algorithm and My Dinner Plate: A Low-Carb Confession

It’s funny, isn't it? How we obsess over optimizing *everything* these days. I've been on a low-carb, bordering-on-keto journey for years now, and I've conquered so many food substitutions – pasta? Zucchini noodles! Bread? Cloud bread (don't even get me started!). But potatoes… and rice… those have been surprisingly tricky. The cravings are real!

It feels a bit absurd, this constant quest for the “perfect” alternative. Like I’m trying to outsmart an algorithm, searching for the precise, low-carb equation that will satisfy. I've been exploring shirataki rice and cauliflower rice, and even some fancy potato alternatives, and honestly? It’s a work in progress. 

This whole journey mirrors our relationship with technology, doesn't it? Always searching for the next upgrade, the better version, sometimes losing sight of what truly brings us joy. Maybe a simple baked potato (in moderation!) wouldn’t be the end of the world. 2022 has been a year of re-evaluating what "optimization" really means.
