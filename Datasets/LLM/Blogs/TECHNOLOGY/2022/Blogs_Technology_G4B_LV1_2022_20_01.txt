**The Static in My Head & the Glow of the Screen**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How reliant we’ve become on these little screens? Late 2022, and I was completely consumed. I was battling a really strange mix of symptoms – constant palpitations, foggy thinking, and a creeping sense of… disorientation. I’d spent weeks bouncing between ERs, convinced I was losing my mind. 

The doctors were running tests – Lyme tests, brain scans – trying to pinpoint the cause. It felt like a digital maze, chasing phantom signals.  I started obsessively researching online, of course, fueled by Google and the desperate need for answers. 

Ironically, while trying to understand my body, I was glued to my phone, scrolling, comparing, and feeling *more* anxious. It was like the technology, meant to connect us, was amplifying the static in my head.  It made me realize how important it was to step back, to breathe, and to actually *feel* what was happening, instead of just searching for a digital diagnosis.
