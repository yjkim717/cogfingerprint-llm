**The Scroll and the Shame**

Remember 2022? Scrolling felt… different. It wasn’t just mindless entertainment; it was a constant, low-grade competition. I’d find a new hobby – pottery, sourdough baking, even just learning a new guitar chord – and immediately start measuring myself against everyone else’s Instagram highlight reel. 

Suddenly, my wobbly bowls and slightly-burnt loaves felt *wrong*. It was a weird form of self-comparison, fueled by this relentless social media pressure. I started setting these ridiculously high, unrealistic goals just to keep up the appearance of being “good” at something. 

Honestly, it was exhausting.  I realized I was letting the curated online world dictate my joy.  It took a conscious effort to step away from the scroll and just *do* the thing, for myself.  Anyone else feel this pull?
