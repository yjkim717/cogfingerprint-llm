As I built my React Native app with Expo in 2022, I hit a snag when deploying it to the web. On desktop screens, the layout stretched to uncomfortable widths, making it hard to read. To fix this, I turned to Drawer Navigation and responsive design principles. By adding margins to my app's container, I was able to constrain the width and improve the overall user experience. This simple tweak made a huge difference, and my app now looks great on both mobile and desktop devices. It was a great reminder that responsiveness is key to a seamless user experience across platforms.
