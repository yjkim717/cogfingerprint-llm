It’s 2022, and my trusty H470 motherboard has been a loyal companion—but lately, my aging i3 just isn’t cutting it in newer games. I’ve been weighing an upgrade to an i5 or even an i7, hoping for smoother frame rates and less stuttering during intense moments.

But here’s the catch: my board caps memory speed at 2933MHz. I’ve read endless debates about how faster RAM can boost gaming performance, and part of me wonders if I’m leaving potential on the table. Still, I keep reminding myself that the CPU does most of the heavy lifting, and a jump to an i5 should deliver the noticeable improvement I’m craving.

Sometimes, chasing every last megahertz can distract from what really matters. Maybe it’s time to embrace the upgrade and enjoy the games, limitations and all.
