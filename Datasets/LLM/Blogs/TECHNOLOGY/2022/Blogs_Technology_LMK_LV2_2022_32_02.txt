"Locked Out: A Cautionary Tale of Admin Access"

I'll never forget the frantic call from a small business in 2022. Their two Active Directory (AD) administrators had inadvertently locked themselves out, bringing their operations to a grinding halt. As they scrambled to find a solution, I couldn't help but think of the countless organizations that face similar risks every day. The problem was clear: their reliance on a single point of access for administrative privileges had become a ticking time bomb. The solution lay in implementing a dual-control emergency access system, ensuring that no single individual could lock out the entire domain controller. This incident served as a wake-up call, highlighting the importance of robust security measures. It made me realize that even the most seemingly trivial oversights can have catastrophic consequences. Have you assessed your organization's vulnerability to such risks?
