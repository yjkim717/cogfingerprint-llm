## The Trade-Offs of the Upgrade Cycle

It’s funny how trends bleed into everything, isn't it? Lately, I’ve been thinking about the constant push for the "latest and greatest" in tech, and it reminds me of sports. Specifically, hockey trades. 

Like a team looking to rebuild, I’ve been evaluating my own digital ecosystem. Do I *really* need that new phone? Is upgrading my laptop worth the investment, or am I just chasing a shiny object? It feels like I'm weighing Boeser's scoring potential against Garland's youthful energy, trying to figure out what mix of existing assets and future possibilities will truly move me forward.

Maybe the best approach isn’t always acquiring the biggest, newest thing. Perhaps it’s strategically shedding what’s no longer serving me and finding a focused upgrade – a Burakovsky, if you will – that delivers targeted value. 2022 has been a year of reassessment for everyone, and my tech habits are no exception. What are you trading in for the next season?

I tried to capture the essence of the hockey analogy while weaving it into a reflection on tech upgrade cycles and the feeling of evaluating choices in 2022. Let me know if you'd like me to tweak it or explore a different angle!
