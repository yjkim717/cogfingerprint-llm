## Twenty-One Years and Counting: Why I’m Finally Sharing My IT Journey

It’s a funny thing, looking back at a career. Twenty-one years. Seems like a lifetime in the tech world, doesn’t it? I started back when dial-up was still a *thing* and "the cloud" was something you looked at on a rainy day. I've seen so much change – the rise of smartphones, the explosion of social media, the complete shift to cloud technologies dominating everything.

Honestly, for a long time, I just…did my job. I navigated the ever-shifting landscape, troubleshooting everything from printer jams to complex server issues. I started in a help desk role, slowly expanding my skillset, always learning, always adapting. It’s been a winding road, bouncing between different companies, different roles – a true IT generalist experience.

But lately, I've been thinking a lot about those just starting out. The sheer volume of information, the constant buzz about new certifications, the feeling of being overwhelmed… I remember that feeling vividly.

So, I’ve decided to do something about it. I’m embarking on a project to compile all the lessons I’ve learned over these past two decades into a practical guide for aspiring IT professionals. It won't be about the latest buzzwords (though those will get a mention!), but about the fundamentals, the mindset, and the practical steps to build a solid IT career in 2022 and beyond. 

It’s a big undertaking, but I'm excited to share what I know and hopefully make the journey a little less daunting for the next generation of tech folks. Stay tuned!
