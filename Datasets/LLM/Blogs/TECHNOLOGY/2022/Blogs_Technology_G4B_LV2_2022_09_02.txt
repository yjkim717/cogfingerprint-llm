**The Quiet Annoyance of Solo Snipers**

Remember 2022? Gun of Boom was… a thing. I got really into it, chasing those perfect sniper shots. But lately, it felt less like a game and more like a slow, frustrating defeat. So many players seemed to just camp, popping out to snipe, completely ignoring the team. It’s a weird feeling, watching a game you enjoy turn into a lost cause because of a few individuals prioritizing personal glory over actually *playing* together.  Anyone else feel this way about online games?
