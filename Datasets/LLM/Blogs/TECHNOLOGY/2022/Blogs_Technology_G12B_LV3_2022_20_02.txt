>## The Weight of the World (and My Phone)

It's funny how quickly things can shift, isn't it? Just a few weeks ago, I felt…fine. A little tired, maybe, pushing through the usual end-of-summer slump. But lately, it’s been more. Headaches that linger, a constant low-grade fatigue, and this odd tingling sensation that seems to creep in when I’m staring at my screen for too long.

It's unsettling, to say the least. I'm navigating the usual anxieties about health – you know, the internet rabbit hole of worst-case scenarios. While I wait for appointments, I've been reflecting on something else, too: our relationship with technology. 

Living in 2022, it feels like our brains are constantly being bombarded. News cycles, social media, endless notifications… it's a relentless stream of information. Could this constant stimulation be contributing to this feeling of being…off? I’m not sure, but it’s definitely got me thinking about disconnecting, about prioritizing brain health in a world that demands constant connection. Maybe a digital detox is in order.
