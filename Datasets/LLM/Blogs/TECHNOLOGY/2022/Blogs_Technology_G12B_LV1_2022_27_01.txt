>## The Ghosts of Online Communities

It's funny how quickly things change online, isn't it? I was just reminiscing about TAZ, that old forum, and feeling a wave of nostalgia. It used to be *the* place for creative, slightly chaotic discussions about digital art and emerging tech. There was a playful energy, a willingness to experiment. 

Lately, it feels… different. More serious, less vibrant. I even saw a thread about Ethersea, a project I was initially excited about, devolve into a pretty intense debate. It just felt a bit much.  I'm seeing this pattern across a few spaces, even on subreddits I used to frequent.  Maybe it’s just me getting older, but I miss the days when online communities felt like playgrounds, not battlegrounds.
