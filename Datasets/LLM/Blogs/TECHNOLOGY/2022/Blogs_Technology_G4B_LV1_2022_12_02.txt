**Lost in Translation (and Tracking Numbers)**

Remember last year, I was obsessing over sending a little handmade gift to my aunt in Florence? It felt so…complicated. I’d wrestled with international shipping, the whole Poste Italiane Points Post thing – basically, tiny post offices scattered across Italy – and the sheer panic of tracking a package across continents. 

Honestly, 2022 felt like a weird mix of incredible connectivity and frustrating disconnect. We could video call my aunt instantly, but figuring out the *logistics* of getting a present to her felt surprisingly old-school.  It made me realize how much we rely on apps and online ordering, yet sometimes, the simplest things still need a little human touch and a whole lot of patience.
