"As a parent in 2022, I've struggled to balance my child's love for Minecraft with online safety concerns. When they started playing the Windows 10 edition with friends, I worried about unwanted interactions. I wanted to remove certain friends without shutting down multiplayer entirely. After some digging, I discovered a solution that worked. Now, my child can still enjoy creative worlds with trusted friends, and I can breathe a little easier."
