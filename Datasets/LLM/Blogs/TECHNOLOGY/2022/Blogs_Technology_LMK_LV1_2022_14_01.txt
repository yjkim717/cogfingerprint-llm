As I dived into Tera Online on my rig in 2022, I wanted to create a mesmerizing video loop for Wallpaper Engine. I was specifically drawn to the Starscape server. The challenge? Hiding the UI during server select to achieve a seamless visual. After some tinkering, I finally found a way to record the perfect loop. Now, my desktop is alive with the vibrant world of Tera, a testament to the endless possibilities of gaming and tech fusion.
