## The Tiny Screw That Made Me Question Everything

Seriously, you guys. I’m staring at a single, minuscule screw. A *tiny* screw that’s currently holding my $250 mechanical keyboard hostage. I love this keyboard. I really do. The clicky keys, the satisfying weight… it was an investment, a splurge I justified with promises of boosted productivity and a generally more enjoyable typing experience. 

But now? Now I’m wrestling with stripped threads and a growing sense of frustration. It feels ridiculous – a $250 keyboard brought down by something you could lose in the carpet. It’s making me question the whole idea of investing in tech. Is it worth the hassle when even the smallest thing can derail the whole thing? Anyone else ever feel this way?
