It’s 2022, and my new 144Hz monitor was supposed to be a game-changer. But in Fallout 4, it felt like wading through molasses. I’d tweak ipresentinterval, toggle vsync, and pray the fps cap didn’t invite crashes. Hours slipped by in a cycle of hope and frustration. It struck me then: sometimes, chasing technological perfection pulls us further from the joy it’s meant to deliver. I finally found a stable 60fps, but the real victory was learning when to stop optimizing and just play.
