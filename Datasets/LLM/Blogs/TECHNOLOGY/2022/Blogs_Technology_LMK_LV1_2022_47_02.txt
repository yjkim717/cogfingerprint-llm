"I still can't believe the grueling interview process I went through for a sysadmin position in 2022. It spanned several weeks, with multiple rounds of questioning and technical assessments. While I understand the need for thorough vetting, the lengthy process left me drained. As someone who's on the admin side of tech, I appreciate a rigorous evaluation, but a more streamlined approach would've been appreciated. It made me wonder, is a long interview process really necessary?"
