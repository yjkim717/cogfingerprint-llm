It’s 2022, and my trusty Ryzen 7 2700X and MSI B450 Tomahawk Max are finally moving on. I remember unboxing them—the Wraith Prism cooler glowing in my first real build. It feels strange to pack them up for a hardware swap, sealing the box to be shipped to a new home. Tech moves fast, but these parts served me well. Here’s hoping they power someone else’s projects and dreams just as reliably. On to the next upgrade.
