>## The Backend's Quiet Revolution: Less Code, Happier Frontends

It's 2022, and we're all feeling the pressure. Frontend frameworks are evolving at breakneck speed, demanding more and more from developers. But what about the backend? For too long, it's felt like a separate, almost disconnected entity. I've been wrestling with this disconnect lately, particularly while building a new application with Angular.

The core issue? Business logic scattered everywhere. Frontend components reaching into the backend for tiny bits of data, complex transformations happening client-side... it’s messy, hard to maintain, and frankly, not ideal.

I started exploring the idea of a more integrated approach – a backend library that *actively* participates in state management alongside the frontend. Think DTOs beautifully crafted on the server, pre-processed and ready for consumption. Suddenly, the frontend becomes a presentation layer, focused on what it does best: displaying data and handling user interactions.

It's a shift, for sure. But I'm convinced that bringing the backend closer to the state management conversation can unlock a new level of efficiency and clarity in our application architecture. More to come as I dive deeper!
