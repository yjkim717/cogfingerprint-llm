"As I navigated Berkeley's enrollment center in 2022, I struggled to plan my classes with the schedule planner. Frustratingly, the available seat counts were often inaccurate, making it hard to secure a spot in the courses I needed. I wished for a more reliable academic guide to help me stay on track. Has anyone else had a similar experience with this tool?"
