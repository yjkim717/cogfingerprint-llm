>## The Algorithm and the Unseen

It's 2022, and we're all swimming in algorithms. They curate our news, suggest our music, even nudge us towards potential friends. It's fascinating, isn't it? But lately, I’ve been thinking about what *isn’t* being curated. What remains unseen, unpredicted. 

We demand data, evidence, proof. Yet, there's a part of me, a quiet space, that feels… something beyond the measurable. Not necessarily a “God” in the traditional sense, but a sense of underlying connection, a mystery the data simply can't grasp. Maybe it's akin to those who believe in something *without* needing a religion. Just… a knowing. A quiet acceptance of the unknown, even amidst the constant hum of processing power.
