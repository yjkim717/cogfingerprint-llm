## The Salary Trap: When Does More Money Mean Less Life?

It’s 2022, and the tech world is booming. We’re all chasing those six-figure salaries, right? I definitely was. But lately, I've been doing a lot of thinking. As I climbed the career ladder, the paychecks got bigger, sure, but so did the hours, the stress, and the sheer *difficulty* of the job. 

I started wondering: is there a point where chasing that next salary bump just isn't worth it? Where the work-life balance vanishes and the constant pressure becomes unbearable? For me, it's starting to feel like that point. I’m realizing that career progression shouldn’t just be about the numbers. It's about finding genuine happiness and fulfillment. Maybe that means prioritizing something else entirely.
