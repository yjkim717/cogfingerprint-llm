My body has its own internal clock, and it doesn't care that I'm in Rome. While others are powered by espresso and wanderlust, my system demands a solid eleven hours of sleep. It's not jet lag or fatigue from walking the cobblestones; it's just my autistic brain's non-negotiable need for deep restoration. Managing my energy isn't about doing more, but about honoring this need. So, I trade a late night for a quiet morning, recharging so I can truly see the Sistine Chapel, not just rush through it.

And here is a reflective blog post about technology for 2022.

Remember the "metaverse" hype in 2022? We were promised sleek VR offices and digital concerts. Instead, my most meaningful tech moment was far simpler: a glitchy video call with my grandparents. The pixelated image and audio lag didn't matter. In that imperfect connection, I saw the real promise of technology—not to build a flawless new world, but to tether us more gently to the one we already have. It’s the human moments, not the specs, that truly upgrade our lives.
