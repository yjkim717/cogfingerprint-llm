Looking back to 2022, I remember landing that final interview for my first sysadmin role. The excitement quickly turned to disbeliefâ€”five back-to-back sessions over nearly four hours. Was this marathon really necessary for an entry-level admin gig? It felt more like an endurance test than a conversation. In our fast-paced tech world, I still wonder if such lengthy processes truly reveal the best candidates or just the most patient ones.
