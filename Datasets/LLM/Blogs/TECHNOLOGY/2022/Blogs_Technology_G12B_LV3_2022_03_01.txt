## Is That Meme *Really* Yours? NFTs and the Murky Waters of Originality

Okay, so I stumbled across a fascinating discussion on Reddit the other day – someone wondering about the legal side of NFT memes. Specifically, can you *really* mint and sell an NFT based on a modified or mashed-up meme? It got me thinking. 

We're in this wild 2022 NFT space, and originality feels… complicated. Memes are built on remixing and recontextualizing, right? But copyright is still copyright. It’s a tricky balance. Are we celebrating creative evolution or skirting the edges of intellectual property? Definitely something to ponder as the digital landscape keeps shifting!
