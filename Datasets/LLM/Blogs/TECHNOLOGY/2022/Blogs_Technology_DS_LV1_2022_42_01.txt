It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my React Native Web app stretched awkwardly across a widescreen monitor. The drawer navigation works beautifully on mobile, but here, it feels like a tiny boat lost in a vast ocean. I’d chosen Expo for its simplicity, but now I’m wrestling with margins on desktop screens—how do you contain that sprawling canvas without breaking the drawer’s flow?

After some trial and error, I found that a little thoughtful margin styling goes a long way. It’s a reminder that in tech, we often build for one world, only to discover another. Adapting isn’t just about code; it’s about seeing through the user’s eyes, no matter the screen size.
