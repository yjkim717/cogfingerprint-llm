"Reclaiming My ETH: A Journey Through Lido and Curve. As I sat staring at my stETH tokens, I realized it was time to unstake and get back to ETH. I had staked with Lido, enticed by the promise of passive income, but now I needed liquidity. I navigated to Curve, the go-to DEX for stETH swaps, and began the process. The journey was smooth, a testament to the seamless user experience of DeFi in 2022. I swapped my stETH for ETH, feeling a sense of freedom and flexibility. The Ethereum ecosystem had delivered."
