**The Echo in the Algorithm**

Remember that feeling of watching something *just* a little too fast? Like a glitch in the matrix? Lately, I've been noticing it more and more online, particularly within those corners of Reddit obsessed with stock trading – the Superstonk world. 

It’s unsettling to see coordinated buying spikes, fueled by rapid trading and whispers on platforms like DEX, followed by these sudden, inexplicable bursts of green. It feels less like genuine market response and more like… an echo. An echo deliberately amplified by an algorithm, pushing and pulling prices in a way that feels increasingly manufactured. 

2022 has been a year of rapid technological shifts, and it’s making me wonder how much of our online experience is truly organic, and how much is being subtly, powerfully shaped behind the scenes. It’s a question worth pondering, isn’t it?
