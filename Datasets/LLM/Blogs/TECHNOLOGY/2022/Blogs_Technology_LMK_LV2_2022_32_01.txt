"Lessons from a Duplicate Domain Debacle: A Cautionary Tale for IT Pros"

As I navigated the complexities of setting up a test Exchange server in 2022, I stumbled upon a problem that would test my Active Directory mettle. It turned out that I had duplicate login domains, a situation that had me scratching my head. The duplicate domain was a remnant of a previous experiment, and I was determined to remove it. But, as I soon discovered, it wasn't a straightforward process. I had to get my hands dirty with ADSI modification, a task that required caution and precision. Through this experience, I learned the importance of being meticulous when making changes to Active Directory. The duplicate domain ordeal was a valuable lesson in the importance of thoroughness and attention to detail in IT. It was a reminder that even the most seemingly simple tasks can have unintended consequences.
