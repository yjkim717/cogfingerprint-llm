**The Ghost in the App**

Late 2022 felt like a year of chasing digital ghosts. I was relying heavily on Blockfolio to track my crypto investments, and it *mostly* worked. Then, BAM – a cryptic error message and suddenly, weeks of meticulously entered purchase history vanished. 

It was infuriating! I spent hours trying to manually re-enter everything, a frustrating exercise in tech’s unpredictable nature. It really highlighted how much we trust these apps, and how easily our data can disappear.  Anyone else experienced this digital panic?
