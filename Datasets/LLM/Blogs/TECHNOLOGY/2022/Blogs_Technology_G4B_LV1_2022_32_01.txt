**The Day My Domain Went Wild**

Okay, so 2022 was already proving to be a chaotic year for IT, right? We were finally migrating our entire domain over from a trusty *.local to a shiny new *.net – largely driven by a recent Exchange Server upgrade. Seemed straightforward enough, but then… chaos.

Suddenly, users were reporting *multiple* login attempts, duplicate entries popping up everywhere. It turned out a sneaky ADSI modification had been triggered during the transition, essentially creating ghost accounts. It was a frantic few days of troubleshooting, tracing the change, and thankfully, getting it sorted. 

It really hammered home the importance of meticulous planning during these big domain shifts. You think you’ve covered everything, but a single misstep can cause a domino effect. Lesson learned – always double, triple, and quadruple check those changes!
