**The Ghosts of Pokemon Go**

There’s something strangely nostalgic about staring at an old device, isn’t there? I was scrolling through a forum the other day, and stumbled upon a conversation about LineageOS and Pokemon Go. Someone was wrestling with whether to revive an ancient Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 – a tablet practically obsolete by 2022 – and try to spoof locations to catch those elusive Pokémon. 

It struck me as a tiny, poignant reminder of 2020. That frantic summer, glued to our screens, chasing digital creatures.  The idea of trying to breathe new life into that tablet, just for a fleeting return to that simple joy, felt… hopeful. 

Maybe it’s not about the tech itself, but the memories it holds.  Sometimes, chasing a ghost in the system is a worthwhile pursuit.
