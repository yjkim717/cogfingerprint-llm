"As an INTP navigating the digital age of 2022, I've often found myself pondering the intricacies of online social interactions. While technology has bridged geographical gaps, it has also amplified the complexities of human connection. To improve my social skills and foster personal growth, I've been experimenting with online communities centered around shared interests. By embracing this blend of technology and social interaction, I'm learning to better understand autistic behaviors within myself and others, one digital connection at a time."
