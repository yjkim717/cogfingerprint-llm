**Lost in the Scroll – And Finding Myself**

Okay, so 2022 felt *weird*, right? Everywhere you looked, everyone was glued to their phones, scrolling endlessly. I started noticing it too – this constant need to consume, to check for updates. It reminded me a little of how I felt reading *Tower of Dawn*. 

Initially, the sheer scale of Vaselyan’s worldbuilding was overwhelming. But as I kept going, I started to *feel* it, to understand the history and the people. It's the same with social media, I think.  You get lost in the noise, but if you really pay attention, there's a story there – a story of connection, but also of isolation.  I'm trying to be more mindful of my scroll time, and find those deeper connections instead.
