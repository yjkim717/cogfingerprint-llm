### The Digital Campfire: Why Our Games Need Guides

I remember the first time I logged into a major online game. It was 2022, and the world outside was still a bit wobbly, so we were all building new ones on our screens. I was dropped into a universe of breathtaking scale and… utter silence. I had a gun, a vague objective, and absolutely no idea what to do next. I felt like I’d been handed the keys to a cathedral with no map, left to wander its echoing halls alone.

That feeling came rushing back recently when a friend tried to get into Destiny 2. Listening to her overwhelmed questions on Discord—"What’s a ‘god roll’?" "Why is everyone rushing past this boss?"—I realized we’re missing a crucial layer in our digital worlds. We have incredible matchmaking to find teammates, but we don’t have a system to find *mentors*.

What if games like Destiny implemented an official, volunteer guide system? Not just a fancy tutorial, but a program where seasoned players could raise a virtual hand and say, “I’m here to help.” New lights could opt-in, getting paired with a veteran for their first few missions. This guide wouldn’t just show them how to complete a strike; they could point them toward the best community-made resources, explain the unwritten rules of the Tower, or even just be a friendly face in the chaos.

Technology has given us the tools to build sprawling, complex worlds. But we’ve forgotten the oldest technology of all: the campfire. For millennia, we’ve gathered around it to share stories and pass down knowledge. A guided game system would be exactly that—a digital campfire where the community’s wisdom is shared, not scattered across a hundred different wikis and YouTube channels.

It’s about transforming a collection of players into a true community. It’s the difference between being given a key to a building and being welcomed home. In 2022, our games are more socially connected than ever; it’s time we designed that connection to be a little more human.
