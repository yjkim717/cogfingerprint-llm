It’s 2022, and I’m deep into emulating Majora’s Mask 3D, chasing nostalgia. But my Citra MMJ keeps crashing, and Citra Enhanced insists my ROM is encrypted—even though I decrypted it myself. It’s a tech puzzle that reminds me how fragile digital preservation can be. Sometimes, the magic of reliving old games clashes with the stubborn reality of software quirks. A humbling, yet oddly charming, reminder that not everything works as planned.
