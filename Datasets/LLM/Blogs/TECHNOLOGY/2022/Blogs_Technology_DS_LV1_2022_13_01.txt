Itâ€™s funny how a simple invoice can remind you that the world is both vast and incredibly small. In 2022, I was just a Canadian web developer, a one-person show running an auto-entreprise. My office was my laptop, and my clients were everywhere.

Then came a project with a French company. The work was the easy part. The payment details? That was the puzzle. My client needed a SIRET number and a dedicated business account for international transfers through my Wise and Stripe setup. I didn't have a French SIRET, of course. It was a stark, practical reminder that while technology lets us build and collaborate across oceans in an instant, the frameworks of business and finance are still firmly rooted on the ground, in specific countries and their rules. The digital world is borderless, but our bank accounts are not.
