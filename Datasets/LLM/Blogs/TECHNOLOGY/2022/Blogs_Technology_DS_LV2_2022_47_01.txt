### The Tyranny of the To-Do List

I used to wear “busy” like a badge of honor. In my IT world, a cleared ticket queue was the ultimate prize. I’d rush through configurations and scripts, chasing the high of a completed checklist.

Then, 2022 happened. The pressure to deliver faster than ever was immense. But my “quick” fixes started boomeranging. A rushed deployment caused a minor system outage. A hastily written script needed a complete rewrite the next day. I was moving fast, but going nowhere.

It hit me during a rare quiet moment: I was prioritizing quantity over quality, and my mental health was paying the tab. The constant sprint was leaving me drained and my work sloppy.

So, I’m trying something radical: slowing down. I now block out time for deep work and, more importantly, for self-reflection. It’s not about being slow; it’s about being intentional. The real efficiency isn't in how many tasks you start, but in how few you have to do twice. My to-do list is shorter, but my satisfaction—and the quality of my work—is finally growing.
