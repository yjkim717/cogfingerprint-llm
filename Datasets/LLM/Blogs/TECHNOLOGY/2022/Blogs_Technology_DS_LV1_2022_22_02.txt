It’s 2022, and my new machine—barely three months old—is already fighting me. A single, stubborn screw is blocking the spring bush replacement, mocking my collection of precision tools. I’ve tried everything: speed-outs, vice grips, even gentle persuasion. It feels symbolic of modern tech—sleek on the outside, yet one tiny, broken part can bring everything to a halt. Sometimes, the most advanced solutions fail, and you’re left wrestling with the basics, wondering if durability was just an afterthought.
