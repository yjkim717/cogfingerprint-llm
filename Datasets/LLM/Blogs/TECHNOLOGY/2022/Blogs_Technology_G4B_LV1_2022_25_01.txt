**The Day ADFS Said “Nope” to Renewals**

It was late 2022, and we were wrestling with our ADFS farm – a beast of a system, honestly. We were smack-dab in the middle of a certificate renewal, and suddenly, we hit a wall. The error messages were cryptic, pointing to a problem with detecting joined machines. It felt like a digital roadblock! 

After hours of digging, a senior engineer suggested a seemingly simple fix: adding the ‘member’ parameter to the `set-adfs sslcertificate` command.  It was a tiny tweak, but it unlocked everything.  It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, the most elegant solutions are the simplest, and that even established systems can throw you a curveball.  What a relief!
