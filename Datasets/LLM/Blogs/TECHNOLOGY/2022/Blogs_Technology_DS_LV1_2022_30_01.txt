Remember that frantic feeling in 2022 when every app and website seemed to demand a subscription? I almost fell for it with a digital wallet service. The sign-up was a breeze—almost too easy—and before I knew it, I had a new "account" I never truly wanted. It instantly reminded me of my aunt, who accidentally opened a store credit card just to get a one-time discount.

It got me thinking about our digital footprint. We click "agree" so quickly, creating accounts and profiles without a second thought. These aren't physical cards we can cut up, but they are just as real in the data they hold. That year was a wake-up call for me to be more intentional, to treat every digital "sign-up" with the same caution as a financial commitment. Our attention is the new currency, after all.
