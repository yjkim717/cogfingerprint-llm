>## The Algorithm Knows Me Too Well (and I Opened a Walgreens Credit Card Because Of It?)

Okay, real talk. I feel a *little* silly admitting this, but I need to get it off my chest. Remember those targeted ads? The ones you swear are reading your mind? Well, they apparently read mine loud and clear. 

It started with a minor cold. I was browsing online pharmacies, looking for some decongestant. Next thing I know, I'm seeing ads for a Walgreens credit card – promising rewards and discounts. I told myself it was just a harmless click, a quick look. But then… I filled out the application. I don't even remember *actively* deciding to do it! 

It's 2022, and the targeted advertising is so slick, so personalized, it’s almost unsettling. I'm now the proud (and slightly embarrassed) owner of a Walgreens credit card I didn’t really need.  Anyone else ever feel like technology is subtly steering your decisions? I'm seriously considering closing it, and wondering if I'm overreacting. Maybe I should just embrace the rewards points… Nah.
