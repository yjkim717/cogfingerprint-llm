### The Day I Stopped Fearing the Asterisk

I remember the first time I imported a library with a wildcard—the humble asterisk. My professor saw it in my code during a review, his face a mask of polite horror. “You’re importing the *entire* standard library?” he asked, as if I’d just tried to drink from a firehose. “What about namespace collisions? You’re just polluting the global scope!”

That lesson stuck with me for years. Implicitly pulling in an entire library was the mark of a lazy, sloppy programmer. It was a cardinal sin, right up there with not commenting your code. The risk of two functions with the same name clashing was too great. The compiler would get confused, and so would anyone reading your code. It was just… messy.

But a conversation with a colleague last week made me question this deeply ingrained instinct. We were looking at a modern language where the standard library is lean, intentional, and its functions are perfectly namespaced. The compiler is smart enough to handle any ambiguity at, well, compile time. There is no “pollution.” There is only convenience.

It hit me then: my fear of the wildcard wasn’t about logic or performance. It was a ghost from a different era of computing, a piece of cargo-cult programming I’d accepted without question. I was avoiding a potential pitfall that the language’s design had already elegantly solved.

It makes you wonder, doesn’t it? How much of what we consider “good practice” is just a workaround for limitations that no longer exist? We cling to these rules to feel safe, to feel like we have control over the chaos of code. But sometimes, the real progress isn't in writing more precise code, but in trusting the tools to understand our intent. Maybe that asterisk wasn’t a sign of laziness, but a quiet vote of confidence in the language itself. I think my old professor would be horrified to hear it, but I’m starting to see the beauty in that little star.
