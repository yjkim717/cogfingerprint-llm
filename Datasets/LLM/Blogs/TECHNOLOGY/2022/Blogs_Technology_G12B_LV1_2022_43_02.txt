## The Quiet Rebellion Against Over-Testing

It's 2022, and we're swimming in testing frameworks. Which is fantastic! Good testing is vital. But lately, I've been feeling a bit… uneasy about *how* we test. Specifically, how much we’re often digging into the internal workings of our code.

I’ve been wrestling with the concept of "white box testing," and whether we're sometimes taking it too far.  We obsess over code coverage, chasing that 90%+ metric, and often end up writing tests that are intricately tied to the *implementation* of a function, rather than its *interface*. 

Recently, a small shift in my thinking started. I began structuring my tests into separate packages – the classic `_test` convention.  Suddenly, it felt… cleaner. I was forced to think harder about what the function *actually does* and how to verify that, without needing to know *how* it does it. Mocks became a natural consequence, allowing me to isolate components and truly test their contracts.

It’s a subtle change, but it's shifted my focus. I'm less concerned with line-by-line coverage and more focused on ensuring that the pieces of my system play nicely together.  I'm curious: am I alone in this feeling? Do you find yourself battling the urge to test implementation details? I'd love to hear your thoughts on finding that balance between thoroughness and avoiding overly brittle, implementation-dependent tests.
