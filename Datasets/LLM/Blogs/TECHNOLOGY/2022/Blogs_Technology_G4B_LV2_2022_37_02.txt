**Controller Chaos & Nostalgia**

It’s funny how a simple game can throw you for a loop, right? I was diving into *Stranger of Paradise* recently – a brutal, beautiful RPG – and my Xbox controller started doing…weird things. Suddenly, my block was mapped to my trigger! Turns out, it was a budget controller from AliExpress. 

It made me think about how we all adapt tech to fit our needs and budgets.  There’s a certain romance in wrestling with unexpected settings, a little bit of frustration mixed with a whole lot of perseverance.  It’s a reminder that tech shouldn't always be seamless, sometimes it’s the quirks that make it memorable.
