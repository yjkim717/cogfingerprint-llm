Looking back at the tech landscape of 2022, it strikes me how much our digital strategies mirror team-building in sports. We often cling to familiar tools or platforms out of loyalty, much like holding onto a player for their past performance. But real growth sometimes means making tough trades—letting go of what’s comfortable to embrace innovation.

It’s like swapping a reliable but aging piece of software for a dynamic new technology that scales with your vision. In the end, progress isn’t just about upgrading; it’s about courageously reshaping your toolkit for the future, ensuring every component aligns with where you’re headed, not just where you’ve been.
