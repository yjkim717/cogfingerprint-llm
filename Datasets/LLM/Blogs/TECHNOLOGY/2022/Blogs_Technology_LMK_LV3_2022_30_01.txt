The Uninvited Credit Card: To Keep or Not to Keep?

I still recall the day I accidentally signed up for a Walgreens credit card. I was checking out online, and before I knew it, I was enrolled in their rewards program and had a shiny new credit card. At first, I panicked, thinking about the potential risks of identity theft. But as I looked into it, I discovered that the card had no annual fee. So, I was faced with a dilemma: should I close the account immediately or keep it? Closing it would eliminate any potential risks, but it might also affect my credit score. On the other hand, keeping it wouldn't hurt, and it might even help my credit utilization ratio. After weighing my options, I decided to keep it, but with a vow to monitor it closely. It's a cautionary tale about being mindful of our online actions and taking control of our financial management.
