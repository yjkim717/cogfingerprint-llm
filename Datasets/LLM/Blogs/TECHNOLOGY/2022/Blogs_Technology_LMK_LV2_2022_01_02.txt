The irony of smart homes. In 2022, we're surrounded by tech that's supposed to make life easier, yet we're still stuck on the basics - like parking. I recall a neighbor complaining about people parking in front of their house, and it hit me: with all our advancements, why haven't we solved this issue? Perhaps it's time to apply some of that smart tech to our streets. Imagine being able to reserve a parking spot or receive alerts when a space is available. It's a small solution, but it could make a big difference in our daily lives.
