It’s 2022, and I’m reflecting on how much of my digital life feels like it’s not directly “coded” by me. My phone suggests routes, my watch nudges me to breathe—these aren’t features I explicitly asked for, but they emerge from the complex interplay of algorithms and data, much like some proteins aren’t directly made from genes. It’s a quiet reminder that the most meaningful tech isn’t always what we build intentionally, but what grows organically from the systems we create.
