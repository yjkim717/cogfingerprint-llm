It’s 2022, and I’m in Europe, armed with sleep trackers and productivity apps, yet I’m clocking 11–12 hours of sleep nightly. My routine back home was optimized for efficiency, but here, the fatigue is real. Between time-zone shifts and constant movement, my body’s begging for rest, not more screen time. I’m learning that even with all the tech in the world, sometimes the best hack is to just listen—to slow down, recharge, and let travel work its magic on its own terms.
