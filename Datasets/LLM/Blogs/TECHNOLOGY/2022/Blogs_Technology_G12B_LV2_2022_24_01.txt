## The Algorithm and My Reading List

It's funny, isn't it? How reliant we've become on algorithms. In 2022, I noticed it most with my reading. For years, I'd meticulously curate my "to-read" list, feeling like a literary architect. Then, I started letting the "recommended for you" sections take over. 

Initially, it felt liberating – endless suggestions! But lately, I've been feeling a little…boxed in. All these similar thrillers, all this predictable self-help. I miss the thrill of stumbling upon a truly unexpected gem, the joy of a friend's passionate recommendation. Maybe it's time to reclaim my architect hat and build a reading list, less optimized, more *me*. What about you – where are you letting the algorithm lead?
