"Rebooting My Relationship with Technology: A 2022 Reflection"

As I sat in front of my laptop, scrolling mindlessly through social media, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It was 2022, and the world was more connected than ever, yet I felt increasingly disconnected from the things that truly mattered. I realized that my relationship with technology had become unbalanced, with my screen time skyrocketing and my mental health suffering as a result. Inspired by the nuanced worldbuilding and character arcs found in Sarah J. Maas's works, like 'Tower of Dawn', I decided to take a step back and reboot my tech habits. By setting boundaries and prioritizing face-to-face interactions, I've begun to reclaim my time and energy. Just as Chaol's character development in 'Tower of Dawn' showed me the importance of growth and self-awareness, I'm learning to navigate the digital landscape with intention and purpose. It's a journey, not a destination â€“ and one that's helping me stay grounded in a world that's increasingly online.
