There I was, mid-2022, staring down a single, rusted screw. My machine was down, and this tiny piece of hardware was mocking my entire collection of power tools. I’d already tried the proper screwdriver, the impact driver, even a little percussive maintenance. Nothing. It felt like a personal failure. In our world of smart devices and instant updates, it’s humbling how a 50-cent screw can bring everything to a grinding halt. Sometimes, the most advanced technology is just a well-placed vice grip and sheer stubbornness.
