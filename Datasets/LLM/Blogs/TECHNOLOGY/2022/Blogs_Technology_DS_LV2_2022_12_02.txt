Remember that frantic video call in 2022? My nonna, determined to video-call her sister, was wrestling with her new tablet. "The internet is broken!" she declared, pointing at the frozen screen. It was just a loose charger cable.

That moment hit me. We chase the latest tech, yet the most profound connection often comes from helping someone master the basics. Her triumphant, pixelated "Ciao!" was worth more than any gadget. Technology's real magic isn't in the specsâ€”it's in the bridges we build, one patient lesson at a time.
