)_The Netherlands and the Digital Maze_

Okay, so planning a trip to the Netherlands this year? Me too! I was digging through the Dutch government's website – you know, checking entry requirements – and honestly, it felt like navigating a digital labyrinth. Specifically, the vaccine situation. Negative COVID test in hand, but still unsure if proof of vaccination was *really* needed. 

It's a strange feeling, isn't it? Relying on technology for clarity, only to find it’s adding to the confusion. We’ve become so dependent on online information, yet sometimes a simple phone call feels less stressful. Hopefully, they’ll streamline things soon! Anyone else wrestling with travel tech frustrations lately?
