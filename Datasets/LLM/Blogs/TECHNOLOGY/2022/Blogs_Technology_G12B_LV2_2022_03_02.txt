## Is This Meme Even *Mine*? NFTs & the Wild West of Online Creativity

Okay, so I’ve been diving into the NFT space, and it’s… a lot. Lately, I've been wrestling with a specific question: can you *really* copyright a meme, especially one you’ve tweaked or mashed up?

Honestly, it’s blurring the lines of intellectual property in a way I’m not sure we’re ready for. What do *you* think? Is there a way to navigate this new digital landscape fairly, respecting the original creators while still fostering innovation? Let's chat!
