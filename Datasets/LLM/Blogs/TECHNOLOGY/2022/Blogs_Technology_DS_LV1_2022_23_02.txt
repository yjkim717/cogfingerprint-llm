Remember the frantic scramble in 2022? We were all trying to automate everything, convinced that speed was the ultimate metric for success. I fell for it, too, pushing my team to build a checkout process that was lightning-fast. The result? A cascade of errors from missing customer details. We were moving so quickly, we forgot to ensure we were moving in the right direction.

That small, intentional stop for quality control didn't slow us down; it saved us. It taught me that true efficiency isn't about relentless speed, but about building trust, one accurate order at a time. Sometimes, the smartest tech decision is knowing when to gently tap the brakes.
