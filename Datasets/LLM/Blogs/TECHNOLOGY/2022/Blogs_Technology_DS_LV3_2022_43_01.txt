Remember those endless loops writing helper functions for slices in Go? Yeah, me too. When generics finally landed in early 2022, it felt like a new era. I decided to channel that collective sigh of relief into an open-source package. Crafting those Map, Filter, and Union functions wasn't just about cleaner code; it was about building a shared toolkit for all of us. It’s a small contribution, but it’s my way of giving back to the community that’s given me so much.
