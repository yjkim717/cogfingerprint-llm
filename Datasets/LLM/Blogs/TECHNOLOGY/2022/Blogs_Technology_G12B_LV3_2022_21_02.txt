## The Gig Life and Growing Up: A 2022 Reality Check

Remember being 19 and feeling utterly limitless? That’s where my mind went when I saw a Reddit post the other day. A concerned sibling was wondering if their 19-year-old sister, fresh out of high school and eyeing internships, could also dip her toes into the freelance world without jeopardizing crucial things like child allowance and healthcare. 

It struck a chord. 2022 feels like a turning point, doesn't it? The traditional path – school, full-time job, benefits – is blurring. More young people are exploring self-employment, even alongside internships. It's smart, resourceful, but also… complicated. Navigating benefits as a freelancer, especially when you're still figuring out adulthood, is a whole new level of challenge. Let's hope she finds a way to balance ambition and security!
