The headache started subtly, a dull throb behind my eyes that I blamed on screen fatigue. But soon, it was joined by a persistent tingling in my fingers, a strange numbness that made typing feel foreign. By the time my doctor mentioned hydrocephalus and ordered an urgent MRI, my mind was a fog of confusion and fear.

In 2022, as the world buzzed with AI breakthroughs and metaverse hype, I found myself retreating into the most basic human concern: my own malfunctioning body. While friends debated neural networks, I was lying perfectly still in a neurology clinic, listening to the rhythmic knocking of the MRI machine—technology not as innovation, but as lifeline.

Those weeks of waiting taught me that no algorithm can replicate the relief of a clear diagnosis, no app can substitute for human expertise. Sometimes, the most advanced technology isn’t about building something new, but about understanding what we already are—and helping us heal.
