>## The Little Things That Throw You: A Voicemail Mystery

It's funny how tech frustrations can really get under your skin, isn't it? I finally upgraded to an iPhone 13 this year, excited for all the bells and whistles. But I've stumbled upon a weird little annoyance: my voicemail transcriptions are…gone. Vanished! I relied on those little text snippets on my iPhone 11 and 12 – a lifesaver when I was juggling too much. Now? I’m back to listening to every message. 

It's a small thing, I know. But it highlights how we build these routines around technology, and when they disappear, even temporarily, it feels…disruptive. Anyone else experiencing this Verizon/iPhone 13 voicemail weirdness? Let's troubleshoot together!
