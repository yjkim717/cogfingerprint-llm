As I binge-watched my favorite show on Netflix in 2022, I found myself missing a feature I had grown accustomed to - the ability to jump forward or backward with a simple click, and pause with a tap on the screen. I wondered, can VLC be tweaked to offer a similar experience? Can its interface be customized to match the seamless viewing experience of Netflix? I'd love to see VLC evolve to include these intuitive features.
