**The Walgreens Card Conundrum**

Okay, so 2022 was *weird*, right? I was scrolling through Walgreens’ app last fall, trying to snag a quick photo print, and BAM – a credit card offer popped up. I impulsively clicked ‘apply,’ and now I’m staring at it, wondering if I made a huge mistake. It’s got an annual fee, and I’m second-guessing everything. 

It’s funny how easily these little digital temptations creep in.  It really got me thinking about how quickly we sign up for things without really considering the long-term implications.  Should I just close it immediately?  Anyone else have a similar tech-induced regret? Let me know in the comments!
