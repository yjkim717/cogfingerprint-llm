**The Moment I Realized Just Two-Factor Isn’t Enough**

It’s funny how quickly a tech problem can feel utterly terrifying. Last year, a small business I was consulting with hit a wall – a complete Active Directory lockout. Suddenly, everyone was staring at a blank screen, and the panic was real. 

We’d invested in 2FA, which is great, but it wasn't enough. They hadn’t really planned for an *emergency*. That’s when it hit me: security isn’t just about layers; it’s about having a clear path to get *through* those layers when things go wrong. Dual control, quick administrator access – these aren’t just technical terms, they’re lifelines. Password management needs to be proactive, not reactive. It’s a humbling reminder that even the strongest tech defenses need a human element.
