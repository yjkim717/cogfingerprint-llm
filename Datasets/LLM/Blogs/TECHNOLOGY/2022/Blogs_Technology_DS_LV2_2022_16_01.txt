It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my Ledger screen, feeling like I’ve locked my keys in a high-tech car. My stETH from Lido is just sitting there, and I need to get back to regular ETH via Curve. It’s one of those moments where crypto feels less like the future and more like a puzzle box I’m not smart enough to crack.

But then it clicks—each step on Curve, guided by tutorials and a bit of faith, starts to make sense. There’s a strange satisfaction in navigating these digital labyrinths, a reminder that we’re all just feeling our way through this new world together. Sometimes, the real reward isn’t the ETH—it’s the quiet victory of figuring it out.
