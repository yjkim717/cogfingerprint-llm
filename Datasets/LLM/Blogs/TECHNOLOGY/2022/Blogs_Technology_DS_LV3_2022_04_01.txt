It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through yet another video of someone getting “g-checked” by strangers online—digital hoods where faceless users posture, threaten, and mock others from behind a screen. It’s pathetic, honestly.

I remember a clip where a group of young people—yutes, as some call them—were targeted just for expressing an opinion in a gaming forum. The immediate jump to verbal violence, the performative aggression… it felt so hollow. Why do we treat this like it’s normal? Like it’s some kind of rite of passage?

In real life, standing up to a rival might demand courage. But g-checking random people online? That’s not strength—it’s insecurity masked as dominance. We’ve built these incredible tools to connect, learn, and grow, yet here we are, using them to intimidate and belittle. It’s a sad misuse of the very technology meant to bring us together.

Maybe it’s time we redirect that energy—toward building each other up, not tearing innocent voices down.
