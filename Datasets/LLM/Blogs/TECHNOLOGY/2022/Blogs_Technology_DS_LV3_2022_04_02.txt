It’s 2022, and I’m sitting in my London flat, scrolling through endless shisha flavour reviews on my phone. The usual suspects—Al Fakher mint, double apple—are fine, but my curiosity is piqued by exotic blends available across the pond. Watermelon chill, blueberry muffin… names that sound more like dessert menus than smoke.

But here’s the catch: shipping from the US stings. I weigh the cost against the thrill of discovery. Isn’t that just like tech today? We have the world at our fingertips, yet access isn’t always seamless. A few clicks, a pricey delivery fee, and I’m gambling on taste from thousands of miles away.

It feels symbolic—a small rebellion against limited local options, powered by global digital storefronts. In a way, my shisha hunt mirrors our connected yet fragmented world: so close, yet just out of reach without a little sacrifice. Maybe that blueberry muffin will be worth every penny.
