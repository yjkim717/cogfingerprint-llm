## My Digital Lecture Pile & the Quest for Order (2022 Reflections)

Okay, confession time: my desktop looked like a PDF explosion zone this semester. As a university student, I was drowning in lecture materials. I’d been trying to wrangle it all within my Obsidian vault – linking notes, adding attachments – but it felt… chaotic. 

It really made me think about how we approach digital organization. Is shoving everything into one giant "knowledge base" always the answer? Or is there merit in a more modular approach? Still figuring that out, but at least I’m facing the pile head-on! Anyone else wrestling with the digital deluge?
