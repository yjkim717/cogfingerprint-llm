>## The TikTok Interview and the Weight of Online Reviews

So, I’m in a weird spot. I just finished the technical rounds for a role at TikTok – a dream, honestly. But the waiting period before the final interview has been… unsettling. I’ve been doing the usual deep dive into employee reviews, and let's just say the picture painted wasn't entirely rosy. Lots of chatter about long hours and blurred work-life balance.

It’s 2022, and we’re all supposedly more aware of mental health and sustainable careers. Yet, the pressure to chase these coveted tech roles, especially at a company as influential as TikTok, feels immense. I keep wrestling with it – is this a necessary evil for career progression? Or am I willing to prioritize something more?

Honestly, it’s made me question the whole process. How much should we weigh online reviews? How much should we trust anonymous voices? It's a tricky balance, and a conversation I think many of us in tech are having right now.
