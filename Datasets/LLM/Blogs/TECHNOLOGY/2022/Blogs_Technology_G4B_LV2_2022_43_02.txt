**The Year I Finally Untangled My Tests**

2022 felt like a year of frantic sprints in Go. We were building a new API, and testing... well, testing felt like just *more* code crammed into my main package.  I was throwing together quick unit tests, and honestly, they were a tangled mess.  

Then I stumbled across the idea of truly separate test packages – a revelation! It felt almost rebellious at first, like admitting my code wasn’t perfect. But separating the tests really forced me to think about interfaces. Instead of mocking concrete implementations, I started designing tests around *behavior*. 

Suddenly, my code felt cleaner, and my tests… well, they actually *tested* something meaningful.  I even started tracking code coverage – a surprisingly motivating metric.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best way to improve your code is to step back and build a better system for testing it.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
