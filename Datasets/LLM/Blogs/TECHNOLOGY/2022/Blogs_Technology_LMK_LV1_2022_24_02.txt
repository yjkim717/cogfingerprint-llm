As I navigated the crowded commute to my engineering course in 2022, I realized that the exhaustion wasn't just from the early morning wake-up call. The constant glow of screens on my phone and the laptops of fellow passengers seemed to be sucking the energy out of me. I was guilty of mindlessly scrolling through social media during my daily travels, further draining my already depleted batteries. It wasn't until I started prioritizing sleep and implementing energy management strategies that I saw a significant boost in my academic performance. By setting boundaries around my screen time and making time for rest, I was able to tackle my coursework with renewed vigor. It's funny how a simple change in habits can make all the difference â€“ now I'm more mindful of how I use technology, and it's helping me stay on top of my game.
