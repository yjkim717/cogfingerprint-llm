As I sat in front of my laptop in 2022, I couldn't help but think about how technology has changed the way we approach men's grooming. Just like how I struggled to find the perfect hairstyle, my friends and I would often scour the internet for inspiration. We'd land on blogs and forums discussing the best barbers in Singapore, like QB House. It was a game-changer. With a few clicks, I could book an appointment and get a stylish cut. It's amazing how technology has simplified our lives, one hairstyle at a time.
