## The Blue Light Battle: My Engineering Brain vs. My Bed

Okay, real talk. 2022 has been… a lot. Between a brutal engineering curriculum and a daily two-hour commute, I've felt permanently stuck in a state of low-power mode. It’s a weird cycle: tired from the day, I reach for my laptop to cram in just *one more* chapter, and BAM – blue light overload. 

I used to think more screen time equaled more studying. Turns out, it just equaled more exhaustion. My brain felt like it was running on fumes, and my grades definitely reflected that.

I’ve started experimenting. Strict “no screens” after 9 pm. Ironically, scheduling *actual* downtime – reading a physical book, even just stretching – has made me way more focused during study sessions. It’s a slow process, battling the urge to just scroll, but I’m finally starting to feel like I'm fighting *with* my brain, not against it. Anyone else wrestling with the tech-sleep balance? Let me know your tips!
