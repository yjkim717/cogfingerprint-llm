As I navigated the complexities of frontend state management in 2022, I realized that my business logic was scattered across the codebase. I yearned for a more streamlined approach. That's when I started exploring Java backend libraries that could seamlessly integrate with my frontend state management library. By shifting my business logic to the backend, I achieved a cleaner, more maintainable architecture. The result? A more scalable and efficient application. I'm now convinced that backend integration is the key to unlocking true frontend simplicity.
