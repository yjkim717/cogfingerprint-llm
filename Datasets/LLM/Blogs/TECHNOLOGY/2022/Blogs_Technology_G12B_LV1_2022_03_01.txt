>## Is My Remixable Meme Worth Anything? (Seriously.)

Okay, so I dove headfirst into the NFT world a few months back, mostly because everyone online was talking about it. And naturally, my brain went straight to memes. Like, could you take a classic, remix it a bit, slap it on a blockchain, and *sell* it? 

It's a surprisingly tricky question. Copyright law gets murky fast when you’re dealing with something as inherently derivative as a meme. Are you creating something new, or just profiting off someone else’s viral moment? It's definitely making me rethink the whole concept of originality in the digital age, and whether a simple tweak is enough to warrant ownership – and a price tag. Anyone else wrestling with this?
