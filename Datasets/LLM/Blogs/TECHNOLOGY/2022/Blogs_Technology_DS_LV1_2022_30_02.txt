It’s 2022, and I’ve just aced the technical rounds for TikTok’s SRE role—the hiring manager call is next. But instead of celebrating, I’m uneasy. Whispers of relentless on-call rotations and endless workdays echo in my mind. Is landing a dream job worth sacrificing life outside it? I’m torn between ambition and balance, wondering if any company truly values both. Sometimes, the hardest decisions come after you’ve already succeeded.
