Remember when Go developers joked about generics like they were mythical creatures? Well, 2022 made them real. I spent years writing the same slice-filtering logic repeatedly—tedious, but it built character, right? Now, diving into this new open-source library feels like trading a hand-cranked car for a smooth electric ride. It’s not just about cleaner code; it’s that giddy thrill of watching our community evolve, turning shared frustrations into elegant solutions we can all build on together.
