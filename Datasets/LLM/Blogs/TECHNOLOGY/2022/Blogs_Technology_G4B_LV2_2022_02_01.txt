**The Ghost in My iPhone’s Voicemail**

It’s funny how quickly tech feels… frustrating. I recently upgraded to an iPhone 13, and I was so excited about all the bells and whistles. But then I realized something odd: my voicemail is *missing* features I’ve used for years. It’s like my phone is playing a cruel joke. 

I’m digging into Verizon’s app, trying to find transcripts – a simple thing I always relied on. It’s a reminder that even the newest gadgets aren’t always an improvement, and sometimes, the familiar is worth holding onto.  Anyone else feeling this phantom voicemail frustration?
