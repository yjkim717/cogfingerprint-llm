It’s 2022, and I’m standing in an airport line, clutching my phone like a lifeline. On its screen: my digital vaccine pass, a QR code that feels more powerful than my passport. I can’t help but marvel at how a few kilobytes of data now hold the key to crossing borders, to reuniting with family, to reclaiming a sliver of normalcy.

Technology, once a backdrop to our lives, has become the stage itself. It’s woven into our most human moments—our longing, our caution, our hope. This little rectangle in my hand isn't just tech; it’s a bridge back to each other. And honestly? I’ve never been more grateful for progress.
