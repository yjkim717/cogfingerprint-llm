As I sweltered in my RV last summer, I wondered if my single AC unit was up to the task. With temperatures soaring in 2022, I questioned its performance. I began researching an upgrade to a second unit. I learned that a 15,000 BTU unit draws around 15-20 amps, a crucial consideration for my RV's electrical system. I'm now weighing the benefits of a dual AC setup against the potential strain on my rig's power. Will the upgrade be worth it, or can my trusty single AC soldier on?
