## Sometimes, "Good Enough" is *Really* Good

It's funny how often we chase the "best" version of something, isn't it? I’d been eyeing the Viair 400P-RV air compressor – all those extra feet of hose, specifically marketed for RVs. But after wrestling with the decision, I realized my regular 400P does the job perfectly for my truck *and* my travel trailer. 

2022 felt like a year of realizing that sometimes, the upgrade isn't actually necessary. We're all bombarded with "better, faster, stronger," but a little practicality goes a long way.  It saved me some cash, and honestly, I'm just as happy airing up my tires.  Less clutter, same result. A reminder to appreciate what you have, right?
