### The Ghost in the Machine: My 2022 Job Hunt

I remember the exact moment the hope drained out of me in 2022. It wasn't a dramatic, tear-filled phone call, but a silent, automated email. "After careful consideration..." Another one. Iâ€™d fallen into the "Quick Apply" trap on LinkedIn, firing off dozens of applications into a digital void, only to be met with a chorus of automated rejections. It felt less like a human process and more like shouting into a server rack.

My mental health took a nosedive. The constant pings and impersonal responses chipped away at my confidence. So, I made a rule: for every five applications I sent, I had to write one thoughtful, personalized cover letter. It forced me to slow down and reconnect with my own story. It wasn't about the job I might get, but about reminding myself of the professional I was. In a world of instant applications, my cover letter became my most radical act of self-care.
