**The Scroll and the Silence**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2022, when we’re perpetually connected, feeling truly *present* can feel like a disappearing act. Lately, I’ve been battling a strange mix of symptoms – headaches, a bone-deep fatigue, and a persistent, prickly tingling in my hands. Alongside it, a low-grade anxiety has been creeping in, making it hard to focus. 

It made me think about how much of my attention is pulled into the endless scroll.  Scrolling through news, social media, trying to keep up… it’s exhausting. Like my brain is constantly buffering, desperately seeking a signal, and missing the quiet signals of my own body. 

Maybe, just maybe, stepping away – intentionally disconnecting – is a form of self-care. A way to find that elusive silence and let my system reset.  I’m hoping a little less screen time will bring a little more clarity.
