As I reflect on the ever-changing world of tech in 2022, I'm reminded of the Canucks' offseason moves. Just as a hockey team must strategically assemble its roster, we're seeing a similar dance in the tech world. The rise of cloud computing has given companies the flexibility to "trade" resources, scaling up or down as needed. Meanwhile, the talent pool is akin to free agency - top engineers are in high demand, and companies are competing to attract the best. Players like Burakovsky and Boeser are coveted assets, just like skilled devs. As we look to the future, I wonder: will companies like Amazon and Google continue to be top "trade targets" for talent? And how will emerging tech leaders like Garland (if he were a tech mogul, that is) shake up the landscape? The parallels are intriguing, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.
