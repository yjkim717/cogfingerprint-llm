"As a gamer living in the UK with an Italian PSN account, I've often wondered how PlayStation Network determines code compatibility. It's 2022, and region locking still puzzles me. Can I use a code from a UK store to top up my Italian account? The answer lies in understanding PSN's account region policies. After digging deeper, I discovered that PSN codes are region-specific, and compatibility depends on the account's registered region. This experience taught me to always check the region before making a purchase, ensuring a seamless gaming experience."
