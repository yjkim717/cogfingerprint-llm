## The Day Our Kingdom Lost Its Keys (and What We Learned)

Remember that feeling of quiet panic when something *critical* breaks? I do. We had a doozy last fall. Two of our senior Active Directory admins – locked out. Simultaneously. It felt like the digital kingdom had lost its keys. 

We'd built layers of security, of course, plenty of 2FA, the works. But what happens when even *that* becomes a hurdle in an emergency? Suddenly, you're staring down the barrel of a serious outage.

Thankfully, we had a plan – a dual control process built in for just such a situation. It wasn't glamorous, involving a bit of a frantic scramble and some old-school troubleshooting, but it worked. It reminded me that while fancy security tools are vital, the real safeguard is a well-thought-out recovery process, and the willingness to test it *before* disaster strikes. 

It also highlighted a valuable lesson: even the most complex systems sometimes need a little bit of n factorial-level thinking to solve. Sometimes, the simplest, most documented recovery steps are your best defense.
