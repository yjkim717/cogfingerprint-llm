## The Algorithm Knows I'm Overthinking This

It's 2022, and I'm staring at a perfectly curated Instagram feed, feeling… disconnected.  I’ve always been a bit of an analyzer, a chronic “what if?” kind of person, and the hyper-personalization of everything online just amplifies it.  The algorithm *knows* I spend too long reading articles about obscure topics. It *knows* I'm skeptical of anything too shiny and optimistic.

And honestly? It’s a little unsettling.  Is this heightened awareness of how I’m being categorized making me *more* withdrawn? I catch myself overthinking even simple interactions online, wondering if I’m presenting the 'right' version of myself. Maybe a little less data, a little more genuine spontaneity is what I need. Less algorithm, more… human.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
