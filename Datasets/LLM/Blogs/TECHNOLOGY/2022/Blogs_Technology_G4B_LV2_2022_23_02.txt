**The Little Button That Could (and Sometimes Shouldn’t)**

Remember those days when a simple “Submit” button was enough? Now, it’s…complicated. I was staring at a screen last week, reviewing order processing reports, and it hit me: we needed a better label for a specific button. One that gently alerts a customer their order needs a tweak – a tiny “Customer Correction Needed” button. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? How technology is supposed to *simplify* things, but sometimes it just adds another layer of potential frustration.  A clear, honest button label – that’s the kind of tech I appreciate.  It’s about empathy, really.
