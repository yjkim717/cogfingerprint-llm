"Renewing ADFS Certificates: A Lesson in Persistence. 

In 2022, managing Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) became a bit of a headache for me when it was time to renew our SSL certificate. Our 2016 ADFS setup was running smoothly, but the renewal process hit a snag. After some trial and error, I discovered that using the 'Member' parameter with the Set-AdfsSslCertificate cmdlet was the key to resolving the issue. This simple yet crucial step had been overlooked, and it was a valuable learning experience. It reminded me that even in the world of technology, where processes are often automated, human insight and persistence are essential. By reflecting on this challenge, I've gained a deeper understanding of ADFS and certificate management. For those facing similar issues, I hope sharing my experience can save you some time and frustration."
