## The Peril of the Digital Fortress

Okay, let's be honest. We’ve all been there. Holed up, strategically positioned, feeling *unbeatable* in a game. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with this feeling in *Guns of Boom*, specifically around the whole "snipe camping" thing. It's tempting, right? Find a good spot, rack up those headshots. 

But here’s the rub: when it becomes *all* about my perfect vantage point, and I’m expecting my teammates to clean up the mess, it just…doesn’t work. It's a frustrating cycle. Gaming, at its core, should be about teamwork and strategy, not relying on others to bail you out. 2022 has shown me that even in a virtual world, leaning too heavily on a single tactic can leave you stranded and staring at a loss screen. It’s a lesson I’m carrying into other aspects of my digital life, too.
