"As I dove into Go in 2022, I struggled to find a robust library for common data structure operations. Inspired by the language's newly introduced generics feature, I created goutils - an open-source package offering reusable helper functions for slices and maps. It's been rewarding to see others benefit from this project. goutils has simplified my own code and fostered a sense of community, showcasing the power of collaborative open-source development."
