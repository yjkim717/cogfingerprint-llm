Living abroad in 2022, my digital life hit a snag. I’d built my PlayStation account back home, but now, trying to redeem a European PSN code, I was stuck. Would it work based on my account’s region, or my current IP address? It felt like my identity was split—my gaming history anchored in one place, my physical self in another. It’s a reminder that in our connected world, sometimes the simplest tech, like a game code, can highlight just how tethered we still are to digital borders.
