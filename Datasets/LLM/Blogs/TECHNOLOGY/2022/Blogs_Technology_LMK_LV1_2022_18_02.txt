"Locking Down Local Admins: A Sysadmin's Quest"

As a sysadmin, I've always been on the lookout for ways to tighten up our organization's security posture. Recently, our vulnerability scan flagged a concerning issue: our local administrator accounts had too many privileges. Specifically, they were allowed to log on to the network, which is a big no-no. So, I set out to deny them that access using Group Policy in Active Directory.

My goal was to restrict the "Log on locally" user right to only authorized personnel. I navigated to the Group Policy Management Console and created a new GPO, linking it to the relevant OU. I then edited the policy, heading to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment. There, I found the "Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services" and "Deny access to this computer from the network" policies.

After some trial and error, I successfully configured the GPO to deny local administrator accounts network access. Our next vulnerability scan came back clean â€“ a small win, but a crucial one. I learned that sometimes, it's the little tweaks that make the biggest difference in security.

This experience reinforced the importance of regularly reviewing our Group Policies and User Rights Assignments. As we continue to navigate the ever-evolving threat landscape in 2022, it's clear that staying on top of these details is essential to keeping our organization's digital assets secure. With this change in place, I can rest a little easier knowing our local admins are locked down and our network is just a bit more secure.
