It’s 2022, and my LinkedIn notifications have become a source of dread. Each “Thank you for your interest…” email feels like a tiny paper cut to my confidence. I’ve spent weeks tailoring my resume with the right keywords, only to be met with automated silence.

The emotional toll is real. I’ve had to consciously step away from the screen, turning off job alerts to protect my mental health. My self-care now includes a walk after every application, a small ritual to remind myself that my worth isn’t tied to an inbox.

This job search has taught me that resilience isn't about ignoring the sting of rejection, but about building a life outside of it. The right role will come, but in the meantime, I’m learning to be kinder to myself.
