It’s 2022, and I’m standing in my driveway, staring at my truck’s flat dual rear wheels. My old air compressor just gave up, and I’m diving into reviews for a replacement. The Viair 400P-RV keeps popping up, bundled with hoses and battery clamps perfect for an RV. But I don’t have an RV—just my trusty truck and a TT battery in the bed.

I realized something: tech isn’t one-size-fits-all. The "upgraded" RV model offered extras I’d never use, while the standard 400P was simpler, cheaper, and exactly what I needed. Sometimes, the right tool isn’t the one with the most features—it’s the one that fits your life. Lesson learned: know your own setup before you buy.
