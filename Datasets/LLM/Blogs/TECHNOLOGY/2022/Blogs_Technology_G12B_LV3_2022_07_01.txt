## The Algorithm and the Apricot: A Small Business Reflection

It's 2022, and the online world feels…complicated, doesn't it? I've been wrestling with that feeling lately as I navigate running a small sustainable underwear business. We pour our hearts into creating ethical, eco-friendly pieces, but frankly, demand for higher-priced sustainable goods has taken a hit. 

It's a tough spot. We’re exploring online marketplaces, even considering selling at near-cost just to keep things afloat. It feels counterintuitive, almost like surrendering to the algorithm. But maybe it’s not about fighting it. Maybe it’s about finding a way to connect – a digital apricot offered with genuine care, hoping someone notices the sweetness beneath the surface. It's a reminder that even in the vastness of the internet, human connection still matters.
