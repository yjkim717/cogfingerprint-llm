**The Ghost in the Code: Why Do We *Really* Import?**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with something lately, and it’s a surprisingly frustrating little quirk in how we write code. Specifically, those automatic module imports – you know, when your language just *assumes* you want to use something without you explicitly saying “import this.” 

It’s late 2022, and we’re drowning in libraries and frameworks.  Python, JavaScript, even Rust – they all have ways of doing this. But I’ve been thinking a lot about the *semantics* of it all.  Is it actually making our code cleaner, or just…hiding complexity?

I remember last year, debugging a particularly nasty piece of code, and it took forever to trace back why a function wasn’t finding a crucial utility. Turns out, it wasn't a logic error, but a missing import!  It felt a bit like the code was deliberately playing tricks on me.

I’m not against convenience, of course.  But sometimes, forcing yourself to write `import my_module` feels more honest. More like you’re acknowledging what you’re using.  It’s a slightly more deliberate approach, and honestly, it can make your code easier to understand – even for yourself!  What do you think?  Are implicit imports a blessing or a curse?
