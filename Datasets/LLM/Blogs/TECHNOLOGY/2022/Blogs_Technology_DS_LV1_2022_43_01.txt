It’s 2022, and Go has finally embraced generics—what a game-changer! I recently dove into building an open-source utilities package, crafting helper functions for slices and maps that felt almost magical. With full test coverage and clear go-doc comments, it’s been a labor of love. Reflecting on this journey, I’m struck by how small, well-documented tools can empower developers and foster collaboration. Sometimes, progress isn’t just about big leaps, but the thoughtful details we share.
