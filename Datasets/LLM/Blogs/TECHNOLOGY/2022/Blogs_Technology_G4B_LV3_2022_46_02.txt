**The Quiet Confidence of Building Your Own Path in Tech**

Remember back in 2022 when I was staring down the barrel of an IT career change in Ireland? Honestly, it felt a little daunting. I had a spark of interest, a decent grasp of some basics, but…well, limited formal experience and a budget tighter than a drum. 

The biggest shift came from realizing I didn’t *need* a perfectly polished resume. Instead, I doubled down on self-teaching – online courses, tinkering with projects, and devouring tech blogs. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was *mine*. 

That quiet confidence – knowing I was building my skills brick by brick – became my secret weapon. It’s a reminder that passion and a willingness to learn can take you further than any certificate ever could.  If you're feeling that same pull towards tech, embrace the journey. Your unique experience is your advantage.
