It was one of those 2022 afternoons, wrestling with React Native and Expo, when I realized my app looked fantastic on mobile but completely lost its charm on desktop. The drawer navigation worked smoothly, but the content stretched awkwardly across wide screens, feeling sparse and uninviting. I needed a solution—a way to add those perfect left and right margins for web layouts without breaking the drawer’s seamless functionality.

After some trial and error, it hit me: sometimes, the smallest adjustments make the biggest impact. Just like in life, creating boundaries—whether in code or our daily routines—can bring clarity and structure. Now, my app feels balanced, no matter the screen size, and I’m reminded that thoughtful design isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about creating comfort for everyone who uses it.
