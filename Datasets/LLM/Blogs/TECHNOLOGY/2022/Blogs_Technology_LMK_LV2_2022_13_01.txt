"Getting Paid in Euros: A Canadian Developer's Dilemma"

As a Canadian web developer, I've worked with clients from all over the world, but a recent project with a French company threw me a curveball. They wanted to pay me in euros, and I had no idea how to make it happen. I started digging, trying to figure out the info sec requirements for receiving international payments. It wasn't just about getting paid - it was about doing it securely and complying with regulations. I wondered, do I need a special account? Will my bank charge me an arm and a leg in fees? And what about the receipt? What info do I need to include? After some research, I found the answers. If you're a freelancer or business owner dealing with international clients, you're probably facing similar questions. I'll share my findings, from setting up an IBAN to invoicing in euros. Let's navigate this together!
