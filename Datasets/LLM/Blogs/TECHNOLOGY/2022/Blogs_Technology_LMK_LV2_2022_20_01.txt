**Lost in the Digital Haze: A Reflection on Our Tech Obsession**

As I sat in the dimly lit hospital room, waiting for the CT scan results, I couldn't help but think about the strange trajectory my life had taken. Just a year ago, I was a carefree 23-year-old, glued to my phone, scrolling mindlessly through social media. But after experiencing bizarre brain symptoms and heart palpitations, my world was turned upside down.

Multiple ER visits and a pending appointment with a neurologist later, I found myself pondering the role technology played in my life. Was my constant connectedness to my devices exacerbating my condition? Or was it a mere coincidence?

In 2022, we're more connected than ever, yet feelings of isolation and disconnection linger. We're constantly bombarded with information, and our brains are wired to respond to every ping and notification. It's no wonder our minds are frazzled.

As I awaited my diagnosis, I realized that my tech habits needed a reboot. I'm not advocating for a complete digital detox, but rather a more mindful approach to our tech usage. By being more intentional with our time online, we can reclaim some of the calm and clarity we've lost in the digital haze.

My journey with Lyme disease is still unfolding, but one thing is clear: it's time to reassess our relationship with technology. By doing so, we might just find that we're not only healthier but also more present in the world around us.
