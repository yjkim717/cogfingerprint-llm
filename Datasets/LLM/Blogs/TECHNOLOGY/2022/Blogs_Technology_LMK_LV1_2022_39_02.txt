"As I switched tech jobs in 2022, I wondered: how many vacation days would my new employer offer? Would I be able to negotiate for more? I asked fellow seniors in the field - some had 25 days, others 30. The variance was surprising. One colleague shared that they had successfully negotiated extra days when joining their current firm. It got me thinking - what's the standard? Should we be pushing for more? As we navigate the ever-changing tech landscape, it's clear that downtime is essential. What's your experience with vacation days in the tech industry?"
