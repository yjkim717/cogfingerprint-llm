## The Ghosts of Python Past: Why I'm Suddenly Obsessed with Implicit Imports

It’s late 2022, and I’m knee-deep in a new project – a little utility tool written in a language I’m tentatively calling “Veridian.” It’s early days, still very much a playground, but something about it has completely captivated me. And it all boils down to a seemingly small feature: implicit imports.

Now, I’ve been a Python developer for… well, let’s just say a *while*.  And Python’s explicit import system is as familiar to me as the back of my hand. I’ve spent countless hours wrestling with circular imports, tracing `sys.path` issues, and generally feeling like I'm playing a detective game to figure out *why* my function isn’t finding the module it needs.

So, the idea of *implicit* imports – where the language automatically makes certain standard library functions and modules available without you explicitly writing `import` statements – initially felt… unsettling. Like a design flaw. My brain screamed, "But where's the clarity? How will you *know* what's available?"

But the more I played with Veridian, the more it started to click. It's almost… liberating. You can focus on *solving* the problem, rather than constantly managing dependencies and remembering which modules hold which functions. It feels cleaner, more intuitive, especially for smaller scripts and exploratory coding.

Of course, there are potential pitfalls. Namespace collisions are a real concern. Veridian handles this cleverly by prioritizing core language features and providing a clear mechanism to override implicit imports if necessary. It’s designed to be predictable.

I keep thinking about how much time we, as programmers, spend on boilerplate.  On tasks that, while necessary, often distract from the core logic of what we’re building. Implicit imports, done right, feel like a small step towards reducing that cognitive load.

It’s forcing me to re-evaluate some ingrained assumptions. Maybe the explicit import model, so deeply ingrained in languages like Python, isn't the *only* way. Maybe there's room for a different approach, one that prioritizes developer flow and discoverability, even if it challenges our established instincts.  It’s a fun thought experiment, and one that’s making me look at code – and language design – with fresh eyes.
