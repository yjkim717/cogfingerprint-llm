## The Scroll That Never Ends: Are We Missing the Forest for the Algorithm?

Remember when "doomscrolling" was just a quirky new term? Now it feels like a defining characteristic of 2022. I've been thinking a lot about our relationship with tech lately – specifically, how it’s designed to keep us *in*, rather than move us *through*. 

It's like that feeling when you're deep in a series you love, and you hit a book that everyone says is…difficult. (Anyone else feel me on *Tower of Dawn* and the Throne of Glass series?!) You might grumble, but you know it’s *necessary* to understand the whole picture.

Social media, endless news feeds…they're all the same. We get sucked in, chasing that next notification, that fleeting dopamine hit. But are we actually consuming? Or just endlessly scrolling, missing the bigger story happening offline? 

Maybe it’s time to be more intentional. To treat our digital lives like we would a really good book – read it with purpose, and then *close it* to go experience the world outside. Just a thought. What do you think?
