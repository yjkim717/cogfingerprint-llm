As I was building my latest web application in 2022, I found myself wrestling with a familiar problem: where to put the business logic. My frontend state management library was handling the UI state beautifully, but I was struggling to integrate it with my backend. I wanted to keep the business logic on the server-side, where it belonged, but the available libraries didn't seem to be cooperating. I began searching for a Java library that could seamlessly integrate with my frontend state management library, allowing me to manage state changes and business logic in a unified way. After weeks of searching, I'm still on the hunt for the perfect solution. Has anyone else encountered this challenge? I'm eager to hear about your experiences and learn from your solutions.
