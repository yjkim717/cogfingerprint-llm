Here in Central Texas, the summer heat is relentless. Last July, as temperatures hit 94 degrees, I found myself questioning my RV’s single 15K BTU air conditioner. My 2022 284BHS felt more like a greenhouse than a retreat. Was this normal, or was it time for an upgrade? It’s a tech problem many of us face: when does comfort demand an investment? Staring at the thermostat, I realized that sometimes, the smartest upgrade isn’t just about more power—it’s about reclaiming your peace.
