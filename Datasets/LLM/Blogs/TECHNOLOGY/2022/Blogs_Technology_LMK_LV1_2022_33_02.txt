"As of late 2022, I've noticed a frustrating trend across multiple YouTube clients - comments just aren't loading. Whether I'm using Vanced, the stock YouTube app, or even NewPipe, the issue persists. It's got me wondering: is this a problem with the apps themselves, or is YouTube the culprit? With multiple platforms affected, I'm leaning towards the latter. Is YouTube intentionally limiting comment loading?"
