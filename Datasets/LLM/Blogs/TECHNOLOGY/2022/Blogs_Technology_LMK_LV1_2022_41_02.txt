"I was digging out my old Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro and wondered if it could be repurposed for Pokémon Go spoofing. The catch? It's running an outdated Android version. I considered installing LineageOS to breathe new life into it. But will it work? I'm not alone in seeking answers. Many users have successfully used LineageOS on unsupported devices for various tweaks. Will it enable Pokémon Go spoofing on my trusty old tablet? I'll be sharing my findings on whether this daring experiment pays off."
