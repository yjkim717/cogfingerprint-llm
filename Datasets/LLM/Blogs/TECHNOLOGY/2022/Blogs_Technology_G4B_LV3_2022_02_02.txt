**Pixel Ghosts and Frustrated Fingers**

There’s something deeply comforting about revisiting childhood favorites, right? I was absolutely determined to finally tackle *Majora’s Mask 3D* again on Citra – that Android emulator – hoping for a nostalgic trip. Instead, I got a frustrating series of crashes. It felt like the game itself was refusing to cooperate, a digital ghost haunting my device. 

Honestly, it’s a surprisingly poignant feeling. Like technology, even beloved classics, can have its limits. Maybe it’s a hardware issue, maybe not, but it reminded me that sometimes, the best experiences are the ones we can *actually* finish.
