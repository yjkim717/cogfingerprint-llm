The perpetual quest for the perfect button label. In 2022, I found myself pondering this very problem while optimizing an order processing assembly line.

As I wrestled with the dilemma, I realized that sometimes, the smallest UI elements can be the most vexing. Have you ever struggled to find the right label?
