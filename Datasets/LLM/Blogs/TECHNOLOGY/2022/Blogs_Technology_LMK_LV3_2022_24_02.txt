"Finding Balance as an Engineering Student: Lessons from a Tiring Commute"

As I reflect on my university life in 2022, I'm reminded of the daily struggles I faced as an engineering student. Long commuting hours left me drained, both physically and mentally. I often found myself sacrificing sleep to keep up with coursework, but this only led to burnout. It wasn't until I prioritized rest and re-evaluated my daily routine that I started to feel more energized and focused. I realized that a good night's sleep was not a luxury, but a necessity for tackling complex engineering problems. By making sleep a priority, I was able to approach my studies with renewed vigor and clarity. This experience taught me that balancing academic demands with personal well-being is crucial for success. By finding this balance, I've become a more resilient and effective student, ready to tackle the challenges of my field.
