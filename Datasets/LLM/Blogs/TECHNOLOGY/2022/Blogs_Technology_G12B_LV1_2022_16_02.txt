## The Curious Case of My Digital Home

It’s funny how much our digital lives get tangled up with our physical ones. I was wrestling with a PlayStation Network code the other day – a small gift from a friend – and it sparked a weird thought. My PlayStation account was created years ago in Italy, a relic from a study abroad trip. Now, I live in the UK. Simple enough, right?

Apparently not for the digital overlords. Redeeming that code became a frustrating exercise in navigating region locks and IP address checks. It made me realize how intensely platforms try to pin us down to a specific location, even when our lives are beautifully, wonderfully *un*fixed. It's a reminder that even in the boundless expanse of the internet, borders still exist, coded into the very fabric of our online experiences. Makes you wonder what other digital walls we're unknowingly bumping up against.
