**The Sticky Bits of Going Global (and Why Stripe Might Be Your Friend)**

2022 felt like the year I finally started seriously thinking about building things *for* the world, not just my little corner of it. I was helping a friend, a brilliant Canadian web developer, tackle a fascinating project – setting up invoicing for a French client. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. 

Suddenly, I was drowning in terms like “SIRET number” and the bewildering world of international payment processing. It highlighted a huge gap in my own understanding of how tech truly connects people across borders.  We were looking at options like Wise and Stripe, trying to figure out the easiest, most reliable way to get paid. 

It’s a reminder that brilliant code is only half the battle.  Building a truly international business – even a small one – demands a whole new layer of logistical thinking.  It’s not just about pixels and lines of code; it’s about understanding the rules, the regulations, and the subtle nuances of different markets.  And honestly? It’s a little daunting, but also incredibly exciting.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect (like the challenges of international payments) or adjusting the tone?
