## The Schedule Planner Paradox of 2022

Okay, so navigating Berkeley course enrollment this year has been...a journey. I swear, the schedule planner is a beautiful, hopeful thing, showing all these available seats. But then you hit the Enrollment Center, and suddenly, *poof*, half those seats have vanished! It's like an online mirage. I spent a good hour chasing phantom spots, cross-referencing everything. It really makes you wonder â€“ are these systems even talking to each other? Just another reminder that technology, even at a place like Berkeley, isn't always seamless.
