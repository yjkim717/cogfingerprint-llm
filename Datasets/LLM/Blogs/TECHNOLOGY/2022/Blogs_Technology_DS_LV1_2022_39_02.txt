Back in 2022, after a decade coding, I decided to switch companies. The salary offers were competitive, but I dug deeper—I asked about vacation. Negotiating those extra zile de concediu felt awkward at first, but my senior experience gave me the confidence. It wasn’t just about days off; it was valuing my well-being. That conversation reshaped how I see tech culture. Now, I encourage every developer to consider time as part of their package. After all, great code needs a rested mind.
