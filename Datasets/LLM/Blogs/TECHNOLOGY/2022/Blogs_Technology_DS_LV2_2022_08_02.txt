### The Ghost in the LinkedIn Machine

It was the third "Quick Apply" rejection of the week, and the silence was deafening. No name, no feedback, just a sterile email from a "Talent Acquisition System." In 2022, the job hunt can feel less like a human endeavor and more like shouting into a void, hoping an algorithm finds your echo worthy.

I found myself refreshing my inbox more than I was refreshing my skills. My self-worth became inexplicably tied to the whims of automated screeners. It was a dark, lonely loop.

The turning point? I had to consciously disconnect to reconnect. I set a hard "tech curfew," muting all job alerts after 6 PM. I started writing one old-school cover letter a week for a role I truly loved, focusing on quality over quantity. The "Quick Apply" button is a siren song, but protecting my mental health meant remembering thereâ€™s a person, not just a profile, on this side of the screen.
