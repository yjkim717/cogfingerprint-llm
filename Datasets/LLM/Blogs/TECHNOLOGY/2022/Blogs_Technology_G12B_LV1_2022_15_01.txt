## The Weight of Beautiful Skies

It's funny how much we chase visual fidelity. Lately, I've been diving back into Skyrim, and the mods are a rabbit hole. Specifically, I'm wrestling with Cathedral Weathers and Seasons â€“ gorgeous, transformative overhauls. But my aging laptop, powered by an i5-9300h, is protesting. Frame rates dip, and I'm constantly tweaking settings. It's a reminder that even the most stunning digital worlds come at a cost, and sometimes, a little less rain is worth a smoother experience.
