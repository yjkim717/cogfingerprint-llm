As I sat in front of my screen in 2020, I couldn't help but wonder: how can I track my website's stats without compromising user privacy? With GDPR regulations looming, I sought a solution that wouldn't require consent. I discovered IP address masking - a game-changer for GDPR compliance. By masking IP addresses, I could collect website data without infringing on user rights. It was a relief to find a balance between data collection and privacy. Now, I can focus on creating content that resonates, knowing my analytics are compliant and respectful of my users' trust.
