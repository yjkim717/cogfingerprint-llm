**The Imposter Syndrome Algorithm**

It’s weird, right? Starting college, especially as a CS major in 2020, feels like everyone else already knows the secret handshake. I’m a freshman, and honestly, a little terrified. My path wasn’t the typical linear one – a few coding classes in high school, boom, ready for Silicon Valley. Turns out, it’s a *lot* more involved.

I’ve been wrestling with this nagging feeling of being behind, especially when I think about computer science interviews and building a solid resume. It’s a classic imposter syndrome algorithm kicking into overdrive. 

I reached out to some upperclassmen, and the advice was surprisingly simple: focus on building, not on appearing perfect.  Start small projects, contribute to open source, and just *do*.  It’s a reminder that learning isn’t a race, and my unique journey is actually a strength.  Anyone else feeling this way?
