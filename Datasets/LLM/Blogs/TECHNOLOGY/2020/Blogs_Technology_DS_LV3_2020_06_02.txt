It’s 2020, and like many of you, I’ve been spending more time at home—digging into old passions. For me, that meant revisiting *Xenogears*, a game I’ve loved since my teens. But this time, I decided to do more than just replay it: I started a YouTube project to explain its dense, beautiful story.

Balancing this with my day job and family hasn’t been easy. Late nights editing, learning about lighting and audio, scrapping drafts that didn’t feel right. But slowly, the production quality improved. More importantly, I felt connected—not just to the game, but to viewers who’d message saying, “You put into words what I’ve always felt.”

Creating something meaningful, even in small bursts, has been a grounding force in a chaotic year. It’s reminded me why we tell stories—and why we keep sharing them, no matter the medium.
