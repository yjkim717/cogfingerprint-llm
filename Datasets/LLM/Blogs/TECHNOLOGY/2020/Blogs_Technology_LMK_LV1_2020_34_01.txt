As a parent in 2020, I'm no stranger to the challenges of getting my 3.5-year-old to bed on time. Despite our consistent nighttime routine, my child still resists sleep, leaving my partner and me utterly exhausted. We've tried everything from a relaxing bath to a soothing bedtime story, but somehow, our little one always manages to find a way to stall. I've started to think that it's not just about the routine, but about the screens. With the pandemic forcing us to spend more time at home, our child's exposure to tablets and TVs has increased. I've noticed that on days when we indulge in more screen time, bedtime becomes even more of a battle. It's 2020, and technology is supposed to make our lives easier, but is it possible that it's actually making parenting harder? I'm starting to think that a digital detox before bed might be just what we need to reclaim our evenings.
