Securing Your Standalone Windows Server 2019: A Developer's Journey

As a software developer in 2020, I've seen my fair share of security breaches and cyber threats. So, when I was tasked with setting up a standalone Windows Server 2019 for business use, I knew I had to get it right. The server would be used for remote work, and I was determined to make it as secure as possible.

My first concern was Remote Desktop configuration. I knew that leaving the default settings on wouldn't cut it, so I started by changing the default RDP port. This simple step significantly reduced the number of automated attacks on my server. I also set up a VPN to add an extra layer of encryption and security.

But securing Remote Desktop was just the tip of the iceberg. I soon realized that there were many other potential security pitfalls to watch out for. For instance, I had to ensure that the server's firewall was properly configured to block any unnecessary incoming traffic. I also made sure to keep the server and its software up-to-date with the latest security patches.

Another crucial aspect was file transfer security. I decided to set up an SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) server to enable secure file transfers. This ensured that sensitive data was encrypted both in transit and at rest.

As I worked on securing my standalone Windows Server 2019, I realized that server security is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. It requires constant monitoring and maintenance to stay ahead of emerging threats.

Looking back, I learned that securing a server is not just about implementing security measures; it's also about being proactive and vigilant. By taking a holistic approach to security, I was able to create a robust and secure environment for my business.

If you're in a similar situation, I hope my experience can serve as a guide. Remember to stay on top of your server security, and don't be afraid to seek advice from experts. With the right measures in place, you can ensure that your standalone Windows Server 2019 is a secure and reliable foundation for your business.

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, it's our responsibility as developers and IT professionals to stay informed and adapt to new threats. By doing so, we can create a safer and more secure digital world for everyone.
