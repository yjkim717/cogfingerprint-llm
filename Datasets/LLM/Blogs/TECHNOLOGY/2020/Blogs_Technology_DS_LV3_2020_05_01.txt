It’s 2020, and I’m staring at a blank C++ project, dreaming of a 2D multiplayer game that might one day find its home on Steam. The ambition is there—the thrill of building something from scratch, of weaving together gameplay and Steam integration. But the path feels lonely. I’ve spent hours sifting through libraries and tutorials, wrestling with security concerns and the haunting thought: how do I bring artists into this technical maze? It’s more than code; it’s about creating a world others want to inhabit. And right now, that world is just a quiet, hopeful blueprint waiting for its first spark of collaboration.
