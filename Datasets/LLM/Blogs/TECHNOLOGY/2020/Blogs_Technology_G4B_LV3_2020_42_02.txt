**Tiny Seeds & Silicon: Navigating Fertility in a Digital Age**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2020, when we could video call anyone across the globe, trying to conceive felt… incredibly complicated.

We were researching home insemination kits, comparing them to IUI and even, with a slightly hesitant heart, IVF. It felt like we were building a fertility plan with algorithms and data, a far cry from the intuitive "feeling" we’d imagined.

It’s a brave new world for trying to start a family.
