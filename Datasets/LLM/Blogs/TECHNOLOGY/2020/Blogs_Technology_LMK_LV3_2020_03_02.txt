Here is a reflective blog post inspired by the given summary, but related to technology:

"As I navigated the complexities of online learning in 2020, I realized that technology was not just a tool, but a bridge to new opportunities. For international students like myself, who were seeking to pursue a medical degree in Germany, it was a lifeline. With the pandemic restricting travel, online platforms enabled us to connect with universities, attend virtual information sessions, and even participate in online Studienkolleg preparatory courses. The recognition of foreign diplomas, a crucial step in the admission process, was also facilitated through digital channels. As I looked back on this experience, I understood that technology had not only made it possible for me to pursue my dreams, but had also opened doors to a more accessible and inclusive education system."
