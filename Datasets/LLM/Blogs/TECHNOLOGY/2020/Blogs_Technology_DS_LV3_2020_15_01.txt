As a longtime Dark Souls veteran, diving into Monster Hunter World in 2020 felt like coming home—yet I was utterly lost. The combat’s familiar weight was there, but the mechanics were a new language. With friends uninterested, I turned online, finding fellow hunters eager to guide a newcomer. It reminded me that even in isolating times, technology weaves communities where veterans and beginners unite, turning solo struggles into shared triumphs. Gaming isn’t just escapism; it’s connection.
