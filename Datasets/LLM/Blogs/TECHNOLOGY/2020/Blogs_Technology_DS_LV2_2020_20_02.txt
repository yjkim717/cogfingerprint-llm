It’s 2020, and I’m staring at a listing for a secondhand PC: GTX 1080, Ryzen 5 1600, $850. My console days feel numbered. I remember the thrill of high-res FPS gaming on a friend’s rig—the fluidity, the crisp details. But is this the right leap? That hardware was top-tier a few years back; will it hold up now? It’s not just specs, it’s about joining a new world. Part of me is ready to dive in, wallet in hand, hoping this machine unlocks the PC experience I’ve dreamed of.
