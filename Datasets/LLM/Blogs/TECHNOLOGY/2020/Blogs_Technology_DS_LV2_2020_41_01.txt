### The Ghost in the Machine

It was 2020, and my entire world was suddenly contained within a 13-inch screen. As I clicked from video call to video call, a strange thought hit me: this little laptop, a tool for connection, was more powerful than the supercomputers that sent astronauts to the moon.

It got me thinking about power, and not just processing power. I remembered an article I’d read about military tech—billions spent on complex weapon systems that sometimes get canceled before they even launch. Oversight issues, budget missteps… the whole saga felt like a distant, bureaucratic drama.

But staring at my own screen, I saw a parallel. We pour our lives, our work, and our relationships into these technologies. We’re in our own acquisition program, constantly upgrading, chasing the next feature. But are we overseeing the process? Or are we just allocating our time and attention to systems that don’t always serve us?

That year forced a kind of personal acquisition reform. I had to ask what “tech” was truly essential. The answer wasn’t the fastest processor, but the most human connection—a simple video chat with a loved one. It’s a lesson that, frankly, should appeal to everyone, no matter your politics or profession. Sometimes, the most advanced system is the one that helps you remember what you’re building it all for.
