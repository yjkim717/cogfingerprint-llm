"Lockdown and the Digital Dilemma: Finding Balance in a Virtual World"

As I sit here in my home office, surrounded by screens and wires, I'm reminded of the drastic changes 2020 brought upon us. The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to retreat into our homes, and technology became our lifeline to the outside world. While it's been a blessing to stay connected with loved ones and continue working remotely, I'm starting to feel the strain of being constantly "on". The blurred lines between work and personal life are taking a toll on my mental health. As I navigate this digital landscape, I'm learning to set boundaries and prioritize self-care. It's a delicate balance, but one that's essential to maintaining my sanity in this virtual world.
