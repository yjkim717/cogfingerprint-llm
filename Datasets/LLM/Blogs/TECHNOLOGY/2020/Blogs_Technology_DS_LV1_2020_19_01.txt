It’s 2020, and I’m thinking about Atlantis again—not the mythical city, but the fictional one from Stargate. The Ancients left behind a treasure trove of tech, yet somehow, schematics for the ZPM—their ultimate power source—were missing. It’s like having a digital archive full of dangerous blueprints but nothing for the one thing that could save everyone from the Wraith.

It reminds me of today’s tech world: we store endless data, but often overlook preserving the foundational knowledge we might desperately need later. Are we, like the Atlanteans, leaving critical gaps in our digital legacy? Maybe it’s time to rethink what truly deserves a spot in our databases.
