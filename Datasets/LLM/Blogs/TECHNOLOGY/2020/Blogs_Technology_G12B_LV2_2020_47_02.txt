## The Tiny Rebellion of My Logitech Mouse

It's 2020, and honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm battling technology more than I'm benefiting from it. We’re all reliant on these little devices, right? Zoom calls, online grocery shopping, trying to keep up with the news… it all hinges on things *working*. 

So, imagine my frustration when my brand new Logitech wireless mouse decided to stage a tiny rebellion. Random lag. Just… freezing. It's infuriating! I’ve spent a good hour wrestling with drivers, checking USB ports, even trying a different mousepad (because, you know, *maybe* it was the mousepad’s fault?). 

It’s silly, really. It’s just a mouse. But that little hiccup throws off my entire workflow. Suddenly, I'm not focused on writing or researching; I’m focused on *fighting* my computer. 

It’s a reminder, isn't it? How much we take for granted. How easily our routines can be disrupted by something so seemingly minor. And how, in a year already overflowing with unexpected challenges, even a lagging mouse can feel like a monumental annoyance. 

Anyone else feeling the tech-related frustrations lately? Send help (and maybe mouse recommendations!).
