### The Baptism in the Code: Breaking Our Own Infinite Loops

I’ve been thinking a lot about loops lately. Not the fun, musical kind, but the ones we get stuck in. The mental and digital ruts. It all clicked for me while replaying an old favorite video game, *BioShock Infinite*. There’s this moment where the hero, Booker DeWitt, ends an infinite cycle of violence across parallel realities by making one brutal choice: he is drowned at the very baptism that would have created his monstrous alternate self, Zachary Comstock.

It’s a heavy, metaphysical concept. But in the strange, isolated spring of 2020, it started to feel less like science fiction and more like a user manual for our digital lives.

Think about it. What are our social media feeds if not a kind of alternate reality? Algorithms meticulously curate a world for us, a reflection built on our past clicks, likes, and shares. My "Zachary Comstock" is the angry, polarized version of myself the platform thinks I want to be. It feeds me outrage, confirms my biases, and shows me a world where everyone I disagree with is a villain. It’s a comfortable, self-righteous loop, and for years, I just kept getting baptized in that river of algorithmic affirmation.

The lockdown made the loop undeniable. Stuck at home, my digital and real worlds merged. The endless scroll of bad news and hot takes wasn't just a distraction; it was shaping my reality, my mood, my very outlook. I was in an infinite loop of anxiety and frustration, and the algorithm was right there, handing me the next hit, ensuring the cycle would continue.

So, I decided to do a Booker DeWitt. Not literally, thankfully! But I decided to "drown" the data-stream that was creating my problematic digital self. I didn't just log off for a day; I performed a digital baptism. I went into the settings of every app and platform and ruthlessly pruned my interests. I unfollowed the professional provocateurs. I muted the keywords that sent me spiraling. I actively sought out and followed voices and topics that were constructive, curious, and kind.

It was uncomfortable at first. My feed felt alien, almost sterile. The familiar rush of indignation was gone. But slowly, a new reality emerged. I saw more science, more art, more community efforts. The algorithm, deprived of its old fuel, started building a new reflection—a better one.

The loop was broken.

The lesson wasn't that technology is evil. It’s that it’s a mirror. It will happily perpetuate any version of ourselves we feed it, good or bad. In 2020, we were all forced to look into that mirror more closely than ever before. The power, then, isn't just in consuming the reflection, but in having the courage to change what we show it. We have to be willing to drown the parts of our digital selves that hold us back, to break the cycle and choose a better reality. It’s the most important control-alt-delete we’ll ever press.
