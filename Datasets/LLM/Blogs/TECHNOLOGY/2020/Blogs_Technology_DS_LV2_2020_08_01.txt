It’s 2020, and I’m detoxing from my phone. I deleted social media apps, craving quiet in a noisy world. At first, the silence was unnerving. But now, I notice the birds outside my window. My mind feels clearer, detoxed from the digital perfume of endless scrolling. Who knew less tech could feel so rich?
