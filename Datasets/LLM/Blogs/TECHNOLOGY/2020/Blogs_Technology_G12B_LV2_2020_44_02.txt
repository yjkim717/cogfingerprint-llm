Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a 2020 context. I've focused on the impact of video conferencing, given that was a very prominent technological shift during that year.  I've included a few options for a title at the bottom.

## The Ghostly Glow of Connection

Remember early 2020? The world shifted, and suddenly, my living room became my office, my kitchen table a conference room.  And the portal? My laptop screen. We all spent *so* much time staring into those little rectangles, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy through pixelated faces. 

It was bizarre, wasn’t it? Seeing the same familiar colleagues, but somehow…distant.  The subtle cues of body language were lost, the easy laughter felt manufactured. I found myself hyper-aware of my own background, frantically tidying before each call. 

Looking back, I'm struck by how profoundly technology both connected and isolated us. It kept us working, kept us in touch with loved ones, but also introduced this strange, ghostly glow to our lives.  I wonder if we'll ever fully shake off that feeling, that subtle disconnect, even as the world slowly returns to something resembling 'normal'.  It’s a reminder that connection, true connection, is about so much more than just seeing a face on a screen.
