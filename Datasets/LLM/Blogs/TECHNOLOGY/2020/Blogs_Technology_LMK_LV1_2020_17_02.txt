"Securing a Standalone Windows Server 2019: Lessons Learned"

As I sat in front of my computer screen in early 2020, staring at the login page of my newly installed Windows Server 2019, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. I had decided to host some of my personal projects on this standalone server, and I knew that security was going to be a top priority. With the rise of remote work, I was going to need to access it via Remote Desktop, and I was also planning to use it to host some FTP and HTTP services.

My first thought was to lock down Remote Desktop by changing the default port and limiting access to a specific IP address. I also made sure to set up a strong password and enable Network Level Authentication. Next, I turned my attention to securing my FTP service. I decided to use SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) instead of the traditional FTP, as it provides an additional layer of encryption.

As I dug deeper into server security, I realized that there were many other potential vulnerabilities to consider. I made sure to keep my server up-to-date with the latest security patches, and I configured the Windows Firewall to restrict incoming traffic to only the necessary ports. I also set up monitoring to keep an eye on any suspicious activity.

Looking back, securing my standalone Windows Server 2019 was a steep learning curve, but it was worth it. I've gained a much deeper understanding of server security, and I feel confident that my server is now a secure environment for hosting my services.
