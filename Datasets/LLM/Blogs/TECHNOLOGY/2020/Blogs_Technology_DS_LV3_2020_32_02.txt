It’s 2020, and I’m staring at this Supermicro LCD display, thinking it’d be a quick weekend project. I’d read about LCDproc and FreeBSD drivers, felt confident. But here I am, hours deep, wrestling with code while this conveniently removable screen just mocks me from the rack. It’s a humbling reminder that in tech, even the “simple” upgrades can turn into personal quests—frustrating, yes, but also weirdly rewarding in the struggle. Anyone else find solace in these stubborn little battles?
