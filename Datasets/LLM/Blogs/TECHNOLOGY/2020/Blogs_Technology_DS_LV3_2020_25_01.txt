Remember those frantic 2020 virtual classrooms? I was the IT guy, troubleshooting why a student’s Chromebook refused to load our science video. It worked fine on my Windows laptop, but on her device—just a spinning wheel. I checked everything: ChromeOS was updated, our Lightspeed web filter was correctly set. That little device, a lifeline to learning, just sat there with its blinking power light. It was a stark reminder that in a world rushing to digital, the smallest tech hiccup can feel like a massive roadblock, leaving one kid stuck and waiting.
