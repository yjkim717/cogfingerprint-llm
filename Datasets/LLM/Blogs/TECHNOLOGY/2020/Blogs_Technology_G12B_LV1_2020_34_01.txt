## The Blue Light and the Bedtime Battle

It’s 8:30 PM, and I’m staring at my phone, feeling a familiar pang of guilt. My little guy, Leo, is *finally* asleep, but I'm still scrolling. It feels ridiculous, doesn't it? Especially when I’m constantly lecturing myself about the importance of a good sleep routine.

This whole year has been… a lot. Work’s been intense, the news is relentless, and honestly, my brain feels like a tangled ball of yarn. So, I’ve been leaning heavily on my phone for a little escape. But lately, I've noticed a direct correlation between my late-night scrolling and Leo’s increasingly restless nights. 

He’s three and a half, and bedtime is already a negotiation. Add the blue light glow from my screen right before he drifts off, and it's like pouring gasoline on the fire. I'm practically fighting a tiny, adorable sleep demon.

Maybe it's time to power down a little earlier, for both of our sakes. Anyone else finding the line between connection and disruption blurring a little *too* much these days?
