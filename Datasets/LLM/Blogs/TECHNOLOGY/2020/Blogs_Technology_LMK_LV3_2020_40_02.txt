The Destiny 2 community's rollercoaster of expectations is a familiar tale in the gaming world. As we navigated 2020, it became clear that the hype surrounding new game rewards often outpaced reality. Bungie, the game's developer, wasn't responsible for the hype, but they bore the brunt of community backlash when expectations weren't met. This phenomenon speaks to a larger issue - our tendency to create unrealistic expectations around technology and gaming. We get caught up in the excitement, and before we know it, we're demanding more than what's possible. As we reflect on our interactions with technology, it's worth considering the role we play in shaping our own satisfaction. By managing our expectations and appreciating the efforts of developers like Bungie, we can cultivate a more positive and rewarding gaming experience. By doing so, we can enjoy the journey, not just the destination.
