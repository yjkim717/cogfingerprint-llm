ravery and uncertainty. It’s 2020, and the world feels… uncertain. I’d been putting off learning Python, convinced I wasn't "techy" enough. The self-doubt was a real roadblock. But then I realized, what did I have to lose? I started a simple online course, and honestly, the process itself – the small victories, the frustrating debugging – has been incredibly valuable. It’s not about becoming a coding expert overnight, but about pushing past the fear and embracing the learning journey.
