**Pixel Dust and Family Trees**

Remember 2020? It felt… strange, didn’t it? Like we were all just trying to build new family trees out of pixels – Zoom calls, online shopping, and a whole lot of staring at screens. I found myself thinking about legacy, about how we leave our mark. 

It’s funny, I was scrolling through some Star Wars fan theories the other day, specifically about Rey and Baby Yoda potentially having twin children. It sparked this thought:  we’re creating our own legacies now, digitally. The photos we share, the online communities we build – they're like branches on a family tree stretching into the future. 

Maybe those little digital connections, those shared memes and virtual hugs, will be the stories our descendants tell about this weird, beautiful, and undeniably connected year.  What do you think?
