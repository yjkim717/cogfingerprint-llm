**Rethinking the Way We Build War Machines: A Call to Action for 2020**

As we dive into a new year, it's time to take a hard look at the way the US military acquires new weapon systems. The current process is broken, and it's costing us big time - not just in dollars, but in the trust of the American people. In 2020, we need to rethink the way we develop and procure military tech.

For decades, the acquisition process has been plagued by delays, cost overruns, and a lack of transparency. The F-35 fighter jet is a prime example - a program that was meant to be a game-changer has instead become a symbol of bureaucratic inefficiency. The costs have ballooned, and the delays have been staggering. It's time to acknowledge that the traditional approach just isn't working.

So what's the solution? For starters, we need to inject some much-needed reform into the acquisition process. That means streamlining the procurement process, increasing transparency, and holding defense contractors to their promises. It also means giving Congress a more meaningful role in oversight, to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely.

By making these changes, we can not only reduce the costs associated with military programs, but also build bipartisan support for a more efficient and effective defense budget. In 2020, let's make a commitment to getting defense tech right - for the sake of our troops, our taxpayers, and our national security. It's time to reboot the system and build a better future for our military.
