**The Quiet Worry Behind the Numbers**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was glued to their screens, tracking everything – website visits, app usage, you name it. I was helping a friend, a web developer, wrestle with a particularly tricky problem: collecting website stats *properly*. Specifically, how to do it while respecting GDPR and all those growing privacy concerns.

It wasn’t just about vanity metrics, you know? It was about recognizing the quiet worry behind all those numbers.  He was meticulously considering things like IPv4 masking – hiding the user's IP address – and even the radius of location data.  It made me think about how much we’re giving away, often without really realizing it. 

Suddenly, those clicks and views felt a little less impressive, a little more…exposed.  It’s a reminder that technology should serve us, not the other way around.
