"I'm a console gamer tempted by the PC gaming world. A friend offered me a secondhand gaming PC for $850, equipped with a GTX 1080 and Ryzen 5 1600. I'm eyeing high-res FPS games, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal. The specs seem decent for 2020, but I'm worried about potential upgrades and compatibility issues down the line. Has anyone else taken the plunge into PC gaming with a secondhand rig? I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether this is a steal or a waste."
