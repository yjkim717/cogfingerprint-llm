Remember 2020, when we all just wanted to connect? I spent an entire evening trapped in a verification loop with FACEIT. Restarted my phone, toggled airplane mode on and off… nothing. It felt like the tech world was mirroring life—a system desperately trying to confirm I was really there, while I sat alone, just wanting to play a game with friends. A small, frustrating echo of the isolation we all felt.
