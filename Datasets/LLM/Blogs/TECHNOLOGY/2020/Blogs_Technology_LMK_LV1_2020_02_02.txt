"As I upgraded to Android 11 in late 2020, I was excited to dive into the new features, including One UI 3.0 on my device. However, my enthusiasm was short-lived as I encountered issues with the Citra emulator, a staple for retro gaming. The emulator couldn't access the SD card, hindering my gaming experience. After some digging, I discovered that Android 11's scoped storage was the culprit. I joined the chorus of users seeking a workaround, hoping to revive my emulation escapades. Has anyone else found a solution to this frustrating problem?"
