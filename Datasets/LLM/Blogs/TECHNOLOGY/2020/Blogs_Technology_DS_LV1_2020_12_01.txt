**Subject: Looking for a Teacher of the Reggiano Dialect!**

Ciao a tutti!

I was born and raised in Reggio Emilia, but I realize I'm losing the true sound of home—our beautiful Reggiano dialect. I'm specifically hoping to learn more about the local expressions and the unique pronunciation, like the classic "ärşān."

I am looking for a patient teacher or a fluent conversation partner for regular practice. I am happy to pay for professional, structured lessons. If you can help me reconnect with this piece of our heritage, please send me a private message.

Grazie mille!

**The Year My Smartphone Felt Dumb**

Remember 2020? My phone was a miracle of technology, yet it felt utterly useless. It could connect me to the world, but not to my family in the next room. We were all on our devices, yet so isolated. It was a stark lesson that for all its power, technology is just a tool. The real connection has to come from us, looking up from the screen.
