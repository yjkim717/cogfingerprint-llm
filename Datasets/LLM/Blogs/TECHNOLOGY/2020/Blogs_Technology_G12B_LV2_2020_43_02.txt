## Taming the Chaos: Why I Finally Embraced Pre-Commit

Remember 2020? A year of unexpected changes. My coding workflow felt pretty chaotic too, honestly. I was *always* finding little formatting issues creeping into Django projects. Then I stumbled upon pre-commit. Suddenly, automatic checks before every commit felt like a superpower. It’s not a magic bullet, but it’s seriously streamlined my process and reduced those last-minute code review headaches. Anyone else feel like a little automation goes a *long* way these days?

**Notes on the choices made to meet the prompt:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** Uses phrases like "honestly," "stumbled upon," and asks a rhetorical question at the end.
*   **Reflective:** Includes a personal anecdote about feeling overwhelmed and finding a solution.
*   **Relatable:** Connects the technical topic to the broader experience of 2020 and the desire for order.
*   **Keywords Integrated:** Naturally mentions the keywords (though 'pipeline' is implied rather than explicitly stated to keep the tone flowing).
*   **Length:**  Around 85 words.
*   **Year Context:** References 2020 directly.
