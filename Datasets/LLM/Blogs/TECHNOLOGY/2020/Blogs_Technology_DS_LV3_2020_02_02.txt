It’s 2020, and my phone just got the Android 11 update with Samsung’s sleek One UI 3.0. I was thrilled—until I opened my favorite emulators. Suddenly, my carefully curated library of retro game ROMs, all stored neatly on my SD card, was out of reach. Scoped storage, the new privacy-focused feature, had put up a digital wall I hadn’t anticipated.

I get why it’s there, but it feels like a personal setback. My pocket-sized portal to childhood gaming memories is now locked, and the workarounds are more frustrating than fun. It’s a reminder that progress in tech isn’t always seamless—sometimes, it asks us to trade a little convenience for security, leaving us nostalgic for the way things were.
