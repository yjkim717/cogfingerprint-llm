"I'm still fuming about my GTA V experience. I've been playing daily since Thursday, rocking my virtual rockstar status, but I'm yet to receive the promised $1 million bonus. It's 2020 and I'm expecting seamless gaming, not frustrating processing delays. I've done everything right, but the bonus remains elusive. Has anyone else encountered this issue? Is it a glitch or just bad luck?"
