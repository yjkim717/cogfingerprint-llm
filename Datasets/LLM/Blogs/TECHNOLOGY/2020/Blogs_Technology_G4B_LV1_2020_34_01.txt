**The Glow of the Screen & the Sleep Struggle**

Remember 2020? It felt like *everyone* was glued to a screen – news, Zoom calls, endless scrolling. My little Leo, all of three-and-a-half, was no different. He’d wind down with a tablet before bed, a little blue glow promising calm. But then… the sleep regressions hit. Suddenly, nighttime was a battleground. 

It felt awful. Leo was exhausted, and honestly, so was I. We were trying to navigate a world already feeling chaotic, and bedtime was just another source of stress. I started experimenting – no screens an hour before bed, a consistent routine with quiet books, a warm bath. 

It wasn't a miracle cure, of course. But slowly, we started to find a rhythm.  I realized how easily we’d traded connection – *real* connection – for the distraction of a screen. It made me think about how much we’re all seeking solace in technology, and how important it is to reclaim those precious moments of quiet, especially with our kids.
