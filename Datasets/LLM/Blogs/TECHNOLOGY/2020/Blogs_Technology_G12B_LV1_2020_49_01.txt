## The Algorithm & My Hesitation

Remember 2020? Everything feltâ€¦ uncertain. I was staring down the barrel of graduation, paralyzed by the sheer volume of online job applications. It felt like battling an algorithm, a faceless system judging my worth. Honestly, I almost gave up. But pushing past that initial doubt, crafting a few thoughtful applications, and actually *submitting* them? That small act felt huge. It reminded me that even in a digital world, human effort still matters. And sometimes, just *trying* is the biggest win.
