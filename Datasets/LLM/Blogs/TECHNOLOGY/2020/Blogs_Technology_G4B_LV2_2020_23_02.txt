**Lost in Translation (and a Little Nostalgia)**

It’s funny what pulls you back to old tech. Lately, I’ve been seriously considering a used Kindle Paperwhite – specifically a 7th generation one. The idea of tracking my reading progress on Goodreads, combined with the built-in Bing Translator for tackling foreign language passages… it’s a surprisingly appealing combination. 

I remember staring longingly at those early e-readers back in 2020, wondering if they’d ever truly replace the feel of a physical book. Now, I’m just feeling a bit of nostalgic curiosity.
