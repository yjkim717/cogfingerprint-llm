The Dark Side of Dental X-Rays: A Personal Wake-Up Call. As I sat in my dentist's chair in early 2020, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't quite right. With the rising number of cancer cases among dentists and my own recent thyroid issues, I began to wonder: are dental X-rays safe? The more I dug, the more I realized that medical professionals are exposed to high levels of radiation daily, putting them at risk. The thought sent a chill down my spine. I started questioning the necessity of frequent X-rays during dental check-ups. It's 2020, and while medical technology has come a long way, it's clear that there's a trade-off. As I navigated my own health concerns, I became more mindful of the invisible risks surrounding us. It's a harsh reminder to be more informed and advocate for safer practices in the dental industry.
