It’s 2020, and I’m stuck in a verification loop with FACEIT. I’ve restarted my phone, toggled airplane mode on and off—nothing. It’s ironic, really: in a year when we’re more connected than ever, a simple digital handshake feels impossible. Each failed attempt leaves me wondering if the problem is my device or just the universe reminding me that some things, even in tech, remain stubbornly out of reach.
