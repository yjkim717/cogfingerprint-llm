### The Unseen Glue

Remember March 2020? The world didn't just slow down; it fractured. Offices, classrooms, and coffee shops—our communal anchors—vanished overnight. In that sudden silence, it was technology, our often-criticized digital scapegoat, that quietly stepped in to become the glue.

It wasn't about the latest processor or a fancy new app. It was my mom’s face, pixelated and frozen, on a weekly Zoom call, her laughter a lifeline across a thousand miles. It was the shared document with colleagues, the digital whiteboard where we fumbled through ideas, desperately trying to recreate the energy of a room. My phone became a portal to a friend’s living room for a virtual happy hour, a pathetic yet profound substitute for a hug.

We often talk about tech in terms of disruption and innovation. But in that strange, fearful year, I learned its most vital role: connection. It was the fragile, flickering bridge that held us together when everything else fell apart, and for that, I’ll always be grateful.
