It’s 2020, and I’ve been dreaming of a Rivian electric truck for months—the sleek design, the whisper-quiet ride. But here I am, trying to budget, and the pricing details are still a mystery. It’s like planning a road trip without knowing the cost of gas. I get it, product launches are complex, but my financial planning is on hold. In a world craving innovation, a little transparency could turn my anticipation into commitment. Anyone else feeling this electric limbo?
