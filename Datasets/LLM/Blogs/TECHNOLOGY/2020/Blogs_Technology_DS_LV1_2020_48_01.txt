Remember back in early 2020, when we thought the future was all but guaranteed? I was eagerly following Rivian, captivated by their promise of an electrochromic roof that could shift from clear to tinted with a tap. The mid-range model seemed perfect for my family. But as I sat down to plan, that excitement turned to frustration.

Without clear pricing, I was budgeting in the dark. It felt symbolic of the year itselfâ€”so much potential, yet so much uncertainty. We were all learning to navigate the unknown, hoping the tech we trusted would lead us to solid ground.
