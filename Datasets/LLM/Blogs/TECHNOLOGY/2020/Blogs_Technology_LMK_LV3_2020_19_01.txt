As we navigated the complexities of 2020, I couldn't help but ponder the technological legacy of the Atlanteans. If they possessed advanced knowledge, as depicted in the Stargate universe, why didn't they leave behind a blueprint for replicating Zero Point Modules (ZPMs) in Atlantis's vast database? It's intriguing to consider what we could achieve if we had access to such powerful technology. The absence of ZPM schematics raises questions about the Atlanteans' priorities and the challenges we face in advancing our own technological capabilities.
