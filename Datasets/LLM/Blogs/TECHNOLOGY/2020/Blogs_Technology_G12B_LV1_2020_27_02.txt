## The Scroll and the Sigh

It's… a lot, right? 2020. We all feel it. I've been finding myself just *staring* at my phone lately, not really *doing* anything. Just scrolling. News, opinions, outrage, memes – it’s a constant flood. COVID numbers, the escalating racial tensions, the political divide… it’s enough to make anyone feel utterly drained.

I realized the other day that my social media feed has become a curated echo chamber of my own frustrations.  And honestly, it’s not helping. It’s just amplifying the anger.  I'm trying to be more mindful, to disconnect a little, to actually *live* instead of just witnessing the world’s anxieties through a screen.  Easier said than done, of course. But maybe, just maybe, a little less scrolling and a little more breathing is what we all need right now.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
