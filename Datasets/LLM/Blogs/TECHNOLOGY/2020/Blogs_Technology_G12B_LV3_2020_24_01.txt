## The Deathmatch Paradox of 2020

Anyone else feeling like their CS:GO aim is stuck in a weird loop? I've been grinding Deathmatch, really focusing on crosshair placement and controlled bursts, but when I hop into competitive, it all falls apart. It's frustrating! It feels like all that practice isn’t *really* translating. Maybe it's just the pressure, or the different pace… or maybe I need to rethink my approach entirely. Anyone else experiencing this weird skill transfer disconnect?
