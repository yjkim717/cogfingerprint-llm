>## The Missing Numbers and the Future of Investing

It's funny, isn't it, how reliant we've become on these apps to manage our finances? I was looking at my Rolls Royce shares the other day on Trading 212 – a relatively new platform I'd signed up for earlier in the year – and noticed something odd. No dividend yield displayed. Just…nothing. 

It made me pause. We’re supposed to be empowered by this technology, right? Instant information, easy trading. Yet, sometimes it feels like a layer of abstraction has come between me and the actual numbers. 

I ended up digging around on other sites to find the dividend information, and it got me thinking: are we becoming *too* dependent on these platforms? Are we losing the fundamental understanding of what we're investing in, trusting algorithms instead of doing our own research? It’s a question I’ll be pondering, especially as 2020 continues to throw curveballs our way.
