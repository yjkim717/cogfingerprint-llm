**The Ghosts of DDR3 – And a £300 Gaming Quest**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple desire to play a new game or finally tackle a decent coding project can dredge up the ghosts of past tech decisions. I’ve been wrestling with exactly that lately – a £300 upgrade to my PC, trying to inject some life into an older machine. 

My current setup is… well, it’s clinging on thanks to a trusty DDR3 motherboard. But the world has moved on, hasn't it? DDR4 is the new normal, and I’m hitting a wall trying to find a motherboard that plays nicely with my existing parts. 

It’s a frustrating dance between wanting a speed boost (a new SSD is *essential*, let’s be honest) and the reality of compatibility.  It feels a bit like trying to build a modern house on an old foundation.  There’s a certain melancholy in knowing some pieces just won’t fit anymore, but also a quiet satisfaction in figuring out how to make the best of what you have.  Anyone else feel this pang of tech nostalgia?
