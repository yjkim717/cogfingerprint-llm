The struggles of being a K-12 sysadmin in 2020! I was stumped when videos stopped loading on our Chromebooks, despite updating ChromeOS. I'd configured our Lightspeed web filter with internal exemptions, but still, no luck. It was like hitting a roadblock. After some digging, I discovered a compatibility issue was to blame. It was a frustrating but valuable lesson in the importance of staying on top of tech updates and testing for compatibility. Has anyone else out there battled a similar tech woe?
