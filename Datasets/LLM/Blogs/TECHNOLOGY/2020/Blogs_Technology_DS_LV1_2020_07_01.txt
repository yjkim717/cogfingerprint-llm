It’s 2020, and my Shopify store is thriving—except for one stubborn issue. I keep hearing how multicurrency checkouts can boost conversions, making international customers feel at home. But here’s the catch: Shopify Payments doesn’t support it in my region. Every time a visitor from Europe or Asia sees prices in my local currency, I can almost sense their hesitation.

So, I’ve started eyeing WooCommerce. It’s open-source, flexible, and promises the global checkout experience I’m missing. Yet, migrating feels like uprooting a garden I’ve carefully tended for years. In a world where tech should bridge gaps, it’s ironic how location still dictates our tools. Maybe it’s time to take the leap, but I can’t help wondering—why must choice be so hard?
