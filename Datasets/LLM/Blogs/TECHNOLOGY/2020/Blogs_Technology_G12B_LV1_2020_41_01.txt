## Chasing Shiny Things: Are We Building the Right Future?

It's 2020, and we're all pretty used to the constant churn of new tech, right? Every week, it feels like there's a "revolutionary" gadget or software update promising to change everything. And while I love a good innovation as much as the next person, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about *why* we chase these things so relentlessly.

I stumbled across an article the other day about how the US military acquires weapon systems – a world away from my daily life of streaming services and smart home devices, yet surprisingly relevant. The core issue? They’re often building things for threats that *might* exist in the future, fueled by a lot of spending and, frankly, not enough critical oversight. Cost overruns are practically a given.

It got me thinking: aren’t we doing something similar in the civilian tech world? We’re so focused on the ‘next big thing’ – metaverse this, quantum computing that – that we sometimes forget to ask: "Do we *really* need this? And are we building it responsibly?"

The pressure to innovate is immense, of course. But I worry we're getting caught up in the excitement of possibility, losing sight of the practical needs and potential downsides. Are we truly solving problems, or just creating new ones? Are we prioritizing long-term sustainability and ethical considerations, or just chasing the flashiest, most profitable trends?

Maybe it’s time to slow down, take a breath, and ask ourselves some tough questions about the future we're building, both in the military and in our everyday lives.  A little more oversight, a lot more critical thinking - it couldn’t hurt, right?
