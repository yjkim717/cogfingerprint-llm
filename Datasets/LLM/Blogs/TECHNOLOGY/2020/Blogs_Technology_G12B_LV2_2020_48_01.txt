Okay, here's a reflective blog post draft, aiming for that conversational, relatable tone and incorporating the provided keywords/summary's core feeling, while being set in 2020.  I've focused on the frustration of delayed gratification and uncertainty in a tech-driven world.  I've also included a title suggestion.

**Title Suggestion:** The Waiting Game & the Allure of "Soon"

---

It's funny, isn't it? How excited we get about promises of future tech. I've been obsessively tracking the Rivian – the electrochromic roof alone is mesmerizing – but the closer the estimated delivery gets, the more… anxious I feel. It’s not just wanting the vehicle, it's the sheer difficulty in planning *around* it. 

Suddenly, a simple car purchase becomes a complex financial juggling act.  Budgeting feels impossible when the final cost is still a moving target.  It’s a strangely modern frustration, this constant state of “soon.” We’re promised incredible things, and the anticipation is intoxicating, but the delay between promise and reality can be surprisingly unsettling. Anyone else feeling the same way about their future tech acquisitions? 2020 has taught us patience, but it's a tough lesson to learn!

**Notes on this draft:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** Uses phrases like "It's funny, isn't it?" and "Anyone else feeling the same way?" to foster connection.
*   **Reflective:**  Explores the feeling of anticipation and the unexpected anxieties it brings.
*   **Relatable:** Touches on a common experience of waiting for technology.
*   **Keywords Integrated:** Mentions "Rivian" and "electrochromic roof" naturally. Hints at "vehicle cost" and "financial planning" through the budgetary struggles. "Mid-range" isn't explicitly mentioned, but the overall tone suggests a thoughtful, considered purchase rather than a budget option.
*   **Year Context (2020):**  The closing sentence acknowledges the broader context of 2020 and the lessons learned about patience.



I hope this is a good starting point! Let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything.
