It’s 2020, and I’m staring at a screen full of C macros, wondering if I’ve stumbled into a cryptic art form or just written unreadable code. I was designing a small C-like language for a hobby project, and I thought, *Why not let macros handle variable declarations?* It felt clever—like a secret handshake for programmers in the know.

But then I showed a snippet to a friend. Their confused squint said it all. "What does this even do?" they asked. And just like that, my cleverness crumbled. I realized I’d traded clarity for what felt like sophistication.

In a world where we’re already drowning in complexity—endless frameworks, shifting best practices—readability isn’t just nice to have. It’s essential. Maybe the real innovation isn’t in how clever our code looks, but in how easily others can understand it. After all, the most elegant solutions are often the simplest ones—the ones that feel like a quiet conversation, not a shout into the void.
