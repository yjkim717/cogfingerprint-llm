**The Endless Scroll: When Tech Just… Feels Empty**

Remember 2020? Everyone was glued to screens, right? I was too. Between the lockdowns and the constant news cycle, I found myself falling into this weird habit – endless grinding in *Legends of Runescape OSRS*. Not questing, just… repetitive tasks. It felt productive, I guess, but utterly directionless. 

It’s funny, isn't it? We build these incredible digital worlds, packed with potential, and sometimes we just get stuck endlessly clicking. It hit me that the constant stream of notifications and the pressure to always *do* something was draining, even though it was technically “entertainment.” I needed a break from the endless scroll, a reminder that real life, and real goals, were still out there.
