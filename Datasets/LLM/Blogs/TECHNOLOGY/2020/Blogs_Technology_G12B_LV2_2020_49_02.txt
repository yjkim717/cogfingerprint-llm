## The Algorithm and My Lost Recipes

Remember when Pinterest felt… cozy? Like a virtual scrapbook of inspiration? Now, scrolling feels different. It’s optimized, curated, and frankly, a little unsettling. I realized it recently when I couldn’t find *my* recipes – the ones I painstakingly pinned years ago. Gone, swallowed by the algorithm's relentless pursuit of what's "trending."

It’s a strange feeling, losing pieces of your digital self. A reminder that these platforms aren't ours; we’re just contributing to their ever-shifting landscape. Makes you wonder what other digital memories are quietly fading, sacrificed at the altar of engagement. Anyone else feeling this?
