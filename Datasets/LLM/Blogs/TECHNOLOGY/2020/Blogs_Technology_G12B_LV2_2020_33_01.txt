## The Digital Checkpoint Blues

Anyone else feel like technology is *constantly* testing our patience these days? I'm battling a bizarre Faceit verification glitch – my phone keeps getting flagged, even when it's not in airplane mode! I've tried everything, and it’s frustrating to be stopped at this digital checkpoint. It's a small thing, sure, but it highlights how much we rely on these systems, and how easily they can throw a wrench in our plans. Anyone else wrestling with tech gremlins lately?
