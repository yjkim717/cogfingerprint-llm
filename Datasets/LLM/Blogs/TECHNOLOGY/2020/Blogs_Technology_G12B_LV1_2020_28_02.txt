## The Algorithm and My Lost Summer

Remember 2020? Everything felt… paused. I’d meticulously planned a summer volunteering trip, fueled by the idea it’d look great on college apps. Then, March hit, and suddenly, *everything* shifted. The application deadlines vanished into the digital ether. It felt like the algorithm just swallowed my plans whole. Now, looking back, I realize the "perfect" summer wasn't the point. It was about adapting, and I found a different kind of growth right here, at home.
