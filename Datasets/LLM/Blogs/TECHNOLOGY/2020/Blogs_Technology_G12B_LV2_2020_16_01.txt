## Is "More" Always Better? A Late-Night Pixel Pondering

It’s late, and I’m staring at my screen, feeling… a little restless. Been diving back into *Minecraft Dungeons*, you know? It's a fun, breezy game, perfect for unwinding. But lately, I've been thinking – is that *all* it is?

We're constantly chasing “more” in tech, aren't we? More processing power, more features, more content. And the upcoming Jungle DLC for *Dungeons* has me wondering if that's actually what we need. Will more levels and creatures genuinely make it *better*, or just… more?

2020 has been a year of slowing down, of appreciating the simple things. Maybe sometimes, less *is* more. Maybe we need to focus on refining what we have, instead of endlessly adding layers. Just a thought, swirling around in the digital twilight. Anyone else feeling this way?
