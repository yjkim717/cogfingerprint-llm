Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone, and set in 2020. I've tried to weave in a relatable narrative about navigating the early days of crypto adoption in Canada.  I'll include some notes afterwards about why I made certain choices.

## The Wild West of Canadian Crypto (and My Bank Account Headache)

Remember 2020? The world felt… uncertain. I was diving headfirst into Bitcoin, convinced it was the future (still am, by the way!). But being a Canadian crypto newbie was *interesting*. Finding an exchange that actually let you link your bank account? A serious challenge. 

It felt like everyone was talking about Coinbase, but the fees for moving larger amounts felt…ouch. I spent weeks researching, comparing, trying to figure out the best way to buy without getting eaten alive by transaction costs. It really highlighted how new this all still felt, even then. 

Anyone else remember the early days of navigating this stuff? What were your biggest hurdles? Let's swap stories in the comments!

**Notes on Choices & Why:**

*   **Relatable Opening:** "Remember 2020?" immediately grounds the post in a shared experience.
*   **Personal Narrative:** Using "I" and describing a personal journey makes it feel more genuine and relatable.
*   **Acknowledging the "Wild West" feeling:** This captures the sense of experimentation and uncertainty that characterized the early crypto space.
*   **Specific Detail (Coinbase & Fees):** Referencing Coinbase and fees directly addresses the user's query from the summary.
*   **Call to Action:**  Asking a question at the end encourages engagement and conversation.
*   **Tone:** I aimed for a casual, slightly humorous tone ("ouch," "interesting") to make it feel like a conversation.
*   **Length:**  Kept it around 135 words as requested.



I hope this draft aligns with what you were looking for! Let me know if you'd like me to tweak anything.
