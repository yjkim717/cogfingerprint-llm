Remember that old CRT TV in my parents’ basement? Last week, I dusted it off, hooked up a VGA adapter, and booted Lakka. For a moment, the scanlines and soft glow of my old PlayStation games through RetroArch transported me right back to 1999. It wasn’t just nostalgia—it felt authentic. In our 4K world, sometimes the best tech journey is the one that takes you back, pixel by beautiful, imperfect pixel.
