**Macros & the Mystery of Readable Code**

It’s funny how some things in programming just *feel* right, and others…well, they feel like a deliberate attempt to confuse you. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with C macros and their use for declaring variables. It started as a simple curiosity – why use a macro instead of a regular `int x;`? 

Honestly, by 2020, I was pretty comfortable with the standard way of doing things. But then I stumbled across a bunch of older codebases, heavily reliant on macros for variable declarations. And it hit me: they seemed to *force* a certain structure, a kind of rigidness that actually hurt readability. 

It made me think about the bigger picture. Programming isn’t just about making a computer *do* something; it’s about communicating with other humans (even if those humans are just *you*, six months from now!).  Do the tools we use help us tell a clear story, or do they add unnecessary layers of abstraction?  I'm still pondering it, honestly. What are your thoughts?
