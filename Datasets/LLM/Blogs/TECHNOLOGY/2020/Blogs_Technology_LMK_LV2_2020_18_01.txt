"Securing Your Digital Workspace: A Geo-Fencing Reality Check"

As we navigated the uncharted waters of remote work in 2020, IT teams scrambled to keep company data safe. One question on many minds was: can we use geo-fencing with Office 365 to boost security? Specifically, those with E3 licenses wondered if they had the right tools to implement conditional access policies that restrict access based on location.

The good news is that geo-fencing is indeed possible with Office 365, but it requires the right licensing - namely, Azure Active Directory Premium P1 licenses. By combining E3 licenses with P1, you can create a robust conditional access policy that ensures only authorized users and devices can access your organization's data from specific locations.

For those still on the fence, take a closer look at your licensing and consider the benefits of geo-fencing. Your organization's digital security is worth it.
