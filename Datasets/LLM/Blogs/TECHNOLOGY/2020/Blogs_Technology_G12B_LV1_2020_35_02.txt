## The Ghost of Stretch Armstrong in the Algorithm

Remember digging through flea markets? I found this weird little rubber figure last weekend, vaguely like a forgotten Stretch Armstrong, but with clunky plastic armor. It felt…analog. A stark contrast to the endless scroll of TikTok I’d been lost in all week. 

It got me thinking. We chase hyper-personalized feeds, algorithms predicting our desires. But sometimes, the unexpected, the random discovery – like a dusty figure unearthed – feels more authentic than anything curated. Maybe a little chaos is good for the soul, even in 2020.
