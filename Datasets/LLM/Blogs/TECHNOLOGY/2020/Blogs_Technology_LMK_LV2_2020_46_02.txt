"Monitoring Exchange 2016 with SCOM - A Journey to Optimization. As we navigated the complexities of Exchange 2016 in 2020, our team realized the importance of effective monitoring. System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) became our go-to tool, but with great power comes great complexity. We were overwhelmed with alerts, and it was challenging to identify the root cause of issues. We began to explore SCOM best practices, delving into override configurations and alert consolidation. By fine-tuning Health Sets and configuring overrides, we significantly reduced noise and improved our response times. The journey wasn't straightforward, but through trial and error, we discovered the sweet spot for our Exchange environment. If you're on a similar path, I'd love to share our learnings and help you optimize your SCOM setup. Let's navigate the world of Exchange monitoring together and uncover the insights that matter most."
