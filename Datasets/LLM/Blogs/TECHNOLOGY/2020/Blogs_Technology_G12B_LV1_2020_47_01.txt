## The Glitch in the Digital Bath

It’s funny how real-world anxieties can mirror the tech world, isn’t it? I’ve been wrestling with a little home repair project lately – a few loose tiles in my bathtub. Nothing major, just a subtle lift, grout looking perpetually damp, a nagging worry about water seeping behind. It’s a slow leak of potential disaster.

And it got me thinking about 2020. This year felt a lot like that bathtub. We built this incredibly complex digital world – social media, remote work, endless streaming – and then, suddenly, cracks started to appear. A few shaky connections, a persistent feeling of things not quite being right, a slow drip of misinformation and isolation. 

Like those loose tiles, vulnerabilities we hadn't fully addressed were exposed. We’re patching them now, applying a fresh layer of “caulk” in the form of new safety protocols and mindful online habits. Hopefully, we’re learning to identify the early warning signs, before the water damage becomes irreversible. It's a reminder that even the most brilliantly constructed systems need constant maintenance.
