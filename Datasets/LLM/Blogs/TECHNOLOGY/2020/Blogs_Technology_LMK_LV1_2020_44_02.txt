"As I sat in the dentist's chair in early 2020, I couldn't help but think about my partner, a dedicated dental nurse, and the risks she faces daily. With the increasing reliance on x-rays in the dental industry, I wondered: are x-rays a ticking time bomb for dental professionals? My partner's job involves frequent exposure to radiation, and I'm not alone in worrying about the potential cancer risk. Medical professionals, including dental staff, are often at the forefront of adopting new technologies, but we mustn't forget the potential downsides. While x-rays are invaluable for diagnoses, the cumulative effect of radiation exposure is a concern. As we continue to push the boundaries of medical technology, it's essential that we prioritize the safety of those who work with these technologies every day. Are we doing enough to protect our healthcare heroes?"
