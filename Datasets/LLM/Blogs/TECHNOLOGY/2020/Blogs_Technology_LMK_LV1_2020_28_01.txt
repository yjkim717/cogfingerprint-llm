"Stuck in a Time Loop: My USACO Conundrum (2020)"

I'll be the first to admit, I was stumped. It was mid-2020 and I was tackling a particularly tricky USACO problem. My code was logically sound, but it just wouldn't pass the test - it kept timing out. I simplified my loop, thinking that was the culprit, but still, no dice. I was stuck.

Upon closer inspection, I realized that my code was performing a simple yet expensive operation: reversing an array. It was a necessary step, but I was doing it the naive way - with a loop. As it turned out, this was the bottleneck. I refactored my code to use a more efficient approach, and voil√†! My solution was not only accepted but also significantly faster. It was a valuable lesson in the importance of code efficiency and the impact of small optimizations on overall performance. Sometimes, it's the simplest tweaks that make all the difference.
