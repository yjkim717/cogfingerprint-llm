>## That Little Dot on the Map & Why I'm Rethinking My Website Stats

It's 2020, and the internet feels… different, doesn't it? We’re all a little more aware of our digital footprints. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a question that’s popped up for many website developers: how do you collect website stats ethically, especially with GDPR looming large?

I used to be all about those detailed analytics – pinpointing visitor locations, tracking browser types, even seeing the rough location gleaned from an IP address. It felt like the key to understanding my audience. But now? It feels… intrusive. 

The conversation around privacy is shifting, and rightfully so. Do I *really* need to know someone's ISP to improve my site? Should I be tracking their location down to the city? Maybe just a general region is enough. It’s a balancing act, and honestly, it’s making me rethink how I approach website data altogether. It's about respect, isn't it?
