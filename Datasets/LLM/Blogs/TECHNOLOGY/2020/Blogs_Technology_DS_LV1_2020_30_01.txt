Looking back at 2020, I remember how my old laptop wheezed through endless Zoom calls. One afternoon, it finally gave out mid-presentation—a pixelated freeze frame of my panic. That week without it felt strangely peaceful; I read actual books and went for walks. When the replacement arrived, sleek and silent, I made a rule: no work after 7 PM. Sometimes, it takes a machine’s final breath to teach you how to truly unplug and reclaim your time.
