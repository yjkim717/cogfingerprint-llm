As we navigated the challenges of remote work in 2020, securing our Office 365 environments became a top priority. One question on many admins' minds was: can we implement geo-fencing with E3 licenses? The answer lies in understanding conditional access policies. While E3 licenses provide a solid foundation, they might not be enough to unlock the full potential of geo-fencing. To effectively restrict access based on location, we need to assess our licensing needs. By doing so, we can ensure our organization's data remains secure, no matter where our teams work from.
