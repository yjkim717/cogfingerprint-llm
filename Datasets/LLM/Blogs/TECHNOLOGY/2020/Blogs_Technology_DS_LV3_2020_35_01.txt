It’s 2020, and I’m scrolling through my phone again—another curated feed of success stories, filtered photos, and motivational quotes. It hits me: maybe we’re all puppets of our own making, pulling the strings on these polished digital selves to escape the raw, messy truth of being human.

We build these illusions—endless notifications, perfect online personas—to distract from the quiet ache of uncertainty, the weight of existing in a world that often feels overwhelming. Technology becomes both the puppet and the puppet-master, helping us craft a reality where suffering feels optional, or at least postponed.

But what happens when the screen goes dark? The illusion fades, and we’re left with just ourselves—no filters, no distractions. Maybe it’s time to ask: are we controlling the tech, or is it controlling us?
