### Navigating the Path to a German Medical Degree: A Guide for International Graduates

The dream of studying medicine in Germany, renowned for its high-quality education and tuition-free policy at public universities, is a powerful draw for international students. For a healthcare graduate from Brazil, this path, while challenging, is entirely achievable with careful planning.

The first and most critical step is the evaluation of your foreign diploma. The German institution responsible for this, the *Zeugnisanerkennungsstelle*, will assess your secondary school qualifications. If your diploma is not deemed equivalent to the German *Abitur*, you will likely need to attend a *Studienkolleg*. This one-year preparatory course concludes with an assessment examination (*Feststellungsprüfung*), which is your gateway to university eligibility.

For those who have already begun medical studies, a course transfer is a complex possibility. Universities will review your previous modules and grades on a case-by-case basis, and credit recognition is never guaranteed. Proficiency in German (C1 level) is non-negotiable for admission.

While tuition is free, living costs are not. Securing a blocked account with approximately €11,000 per year is a standard visa requirement. Scholarships from organizations like the DAAD are highly competitive but worth pursuing. This journey demands significant bureaucratic effort, but for the dedicated student, a German medical degree is a rewarding and attainable goal.

### The Year My World Shrank to a Screen

It was March 2020 when my reality flickered and then rebooted onto a 13-inch display. My bustling office, with its coffee machine gossip and whiteboard brainstorming sessions, vanished, replaced by the quiet hum of my laptop and a grid of faces in little boxes.

At first, it felt like a strange, extended holiday. But as weeks bled into months, a profound shift occurred. Technology wasn't just a tool anymore; it was our town square, our classroom, our family dinner table. I celebrated a birthday through a laggy Zoom call and comforted a friend via a WhatsApp voice note. My world had physically shrunk, but my digital world had expanded exponentially, becoming the primary vessel for all human connection.

It made me wonder: were we more connected than ever, or were we just better at simulating it? In 2020, technology became our lifeline, a stark reminder that while pixels could bridge the distance, we were all still yearning for the messy, unpredictable warmth of the world just beyond our screens.
