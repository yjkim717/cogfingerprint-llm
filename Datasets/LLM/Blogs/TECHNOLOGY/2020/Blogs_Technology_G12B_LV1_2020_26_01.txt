## The Ghosts in My WordPress

It's 2020, and I'm realizing how much digital history I’ve built. My WordPress site, once a vibrant blog, now holds years of posts, a quiet archive. I miss them! It struck me – Facebook’s post review system, that gentle nudge reminding you what you shared, is exactly what I need for my old blog content. A little digital ghost whispering, "Remember this?" Maybe it's time to dust off those stories.
