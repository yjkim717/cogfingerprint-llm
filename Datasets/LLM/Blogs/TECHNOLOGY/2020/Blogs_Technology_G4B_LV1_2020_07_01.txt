**The Curse of the Single Currency**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Back in 2020, I was seriously wrestling with a Shopify store, trying to scale up. The whole multicurrency checkout thing felt *essential* – my customers were scattered across Europe, and a clunky, single-currency experience was killing my conversion rate. 

Shopify just… wasn't getting it. It felt frustratingly limiting. Honestly, I started seriously considering a painful migration back to WooCommerce, just for the flexibility. It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, the newest tech isn't *always* the best – especially when it directly impacts your customers and your bottom line.  Anyone else feel this way?
