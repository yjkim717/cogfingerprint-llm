## The Blue Light and the Buzz: Finding Quiet in a World Turned Up

It's… a lot, isn’t it? 2020. I don't think anyone needs a recap of *that*. We're all living it. But lately, I’ve been noticing something beyond the news cycle, beyond the constant stream of updates and worries. I've been noticing… the noise.

Not just the news noise, the political shouting match noise. I mean *everything*. My apartment, which I share with my parents – a situation accelerated by, well, *everything* – feels like it’s vibrating. The hum of the refrigerator, the click of the TV remote, my mom’s enthusiastic vacuuming, my dad’s late-night news binges... it all layers on top of each other until I feel like I’m underwater, trying to breathe.

I’ve always been sensitive, I guess. Sensory things – bright lights, loud sounds, scratchy fabrics – have always been a bit… much. But the past few months, it's been amplified. It's like the pandemic anxiety has cranked up the volume on everything.

And then there’s the technology. Ironic, right? I spend so much time online, ostensibly seeking connection and information, but it’s just another layer of sensory input. The endless scrolling, the notifications pinging, the blue light reflecting in my eyes… it’s exhausting. I feel guilty disconnecting, like I'm missing something vital, but the pull to just… shut it all off is almost overwhelming.

I’ve started experimenting. Turning off notifications. Limiting my screen time (a monumental effort, I won’t lie). Creating little pockets of quiet in my day – a short walk outside (masked, of course), reading a physical book (the smell of the paper is surprisingly soothing), even just sitting in a darkened room with noise-canceling headphones.

It’s not a perfect solution. The world is still loud, and the anxiety is still there. But finding those moments of quiet, of disconnecting from the constant barrage of information and stimulation, feels like a small act of rebellion, a tiny space to breathe in a world that feels determined to overwhelm. Maybe that's all we can really do right now – carve out those little oases of calm and try to hold onto them.
