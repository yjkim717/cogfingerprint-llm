>## The Static and the Silence

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much we rely on constant connection. I quit doomscrolling a couple of weeks ago – a conscious effort to unplug during this endless 2020. And honestly? It's been...a lot. 

At first, the silence was deafening. My hand kept reaching for my phone out of habit. But now, a different sensation is emerging. A clarity. I'm noticing things I hadn’t before – the way the light hits my plants, the subtle hum of the refrigerator. It’s almost like my senses were muted by the digital noise. 

It makes you wonder, what else are we missing while we’re staring at screens? Maybe a little digital detox is exactly what we all need.
