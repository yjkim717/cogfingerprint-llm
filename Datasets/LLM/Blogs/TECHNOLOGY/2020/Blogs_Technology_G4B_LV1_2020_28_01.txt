**The Timeout Tango**

It’s weird, right? You pour hours into a coding challenge, meticulously optimizing – a while loop here, a clever way to avoid duplicate arrays there. You *think* you’ve cracked it. Then, BAM! Timeout. I hit that wall with a USACO problem last year (2020, feels like a lifetime ago!), and it was infuriating.  It made me realize that sometimes, the most efficient code isn’t always the fastest.  It’s a humbling reminder that debugging can be a frustrating dance, and sometimes, you just need a fresh pair of eyes.
