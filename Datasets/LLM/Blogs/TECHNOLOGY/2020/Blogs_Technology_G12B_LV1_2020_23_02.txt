## My Old Paperwhite Still Holds Up (and a Goodreads Question)

It's funny, isn't it? How tech moves on. I still have my trusty 7th gen Kindle Paperwhite, the one with 3G – feels ancient now! It’s been a comfort during these strange 2020 times. I was just wondering, does anyone else still use one of these older models? I’m trying to figure out if Goodreads syncing is still reliable, and if the built-in translator feature actually *works* anymore. It's a testament to good design, really, that it’s still ticking along. Anyone have experience with it?
