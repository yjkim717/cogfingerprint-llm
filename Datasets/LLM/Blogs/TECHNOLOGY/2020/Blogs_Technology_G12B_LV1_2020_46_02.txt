## The Quiet Hum of Things Running Right

It's funny, isn't it, how we often focus on the alarms? The blaring red lights, the critical errors. Back in 2020, when everything felt constantly on edge, I was deep in the weeds of Exchange 2016 monitoring using SCOM. It was a necessary evil, keeping the lights on for a surprisingly large number of remote workers suddenly relying on email more than ever.

Initially, it was an avalanche of alerts. Every little hiccup triggered something. Rollup alerts? Health Sets? I was drowning in notifications, spending more time silencing redundant warnings than actually *fixing* problems. It felt like SCOM was shouting at me constantly.

Then, I started to shift my perspective. Instead of reacting to every beep, I focused on the quiet hum. The systems running smoothly, the mail flowing reliably. It was a subtle shift, but it changed everything. I refined our SCOM setup, tightened the alert thresholds, and really leaned into those rollup alerts to consolidate the noise.

It wasn't about eliminating alerts entirely – that's unrealistic. It was about finding the balance between awareness and sanity. And realizing that sometimes, the best monitoring isn’t about reacting, but about appreciating the stability when it’s there.  A quiet system is a happy system, and a happy system makes for a much happier sysadmin.
