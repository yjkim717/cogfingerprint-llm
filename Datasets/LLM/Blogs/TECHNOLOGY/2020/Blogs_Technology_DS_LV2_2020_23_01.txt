It’s 2020, and like so many of us, I’ve turned my living room into a makeshift office. I thought I had it all figured out—my trusty JBL Bluetooth speaker would make those endless Zoom and Google Meet calls sound crisp and clear. After all, it pumps out rich, vibrant audio when I’m streaming music or watching videos. But the moment I hop on a call, it’s like my speaker transforms. The audio turns tinny, distant, almost as if I’m listening through a tin can and string.

I’m running iOS 13, and everything else works flawlessly. So why does my Bluetooth audio quality plummet the second I need it most? It’s one of those small, modern frustrations—technology that’s supposed to bring us together, yet sometimes leaves us feeling just a little more disconnected.

Maybe you’ve experienced this too? In a year where connection means everything, it’s ironic how the tools we rely on can sometimes fall short. Here’s hoping for a quick fix—and clearer conversations ahead.
