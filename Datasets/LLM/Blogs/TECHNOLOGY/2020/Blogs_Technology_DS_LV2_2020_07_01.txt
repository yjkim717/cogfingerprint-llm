It’s 2020, and my online store feels like it’s stuck in a time warp. I remember migrating to Shopify a couple of years ago, drawn by its sleek design and promises of seamless scaling. But lately, I’ve been staring at my analytics, frustrated.

Here in my corner of the world, Shopify still doesn’t support multicurrency checkout. Watching international shoppers hesitate and abandon their carts is a special kind of pain. They see the price in USD, do the mental math, and often just… leave. My conversion rate is paying the price for this limitation.

So, I’m looking back at WooCommerce. It’s not as polished, but the freedom to tailor a truly global checkout is incredibly tempting. Sometimes, the shinier platform isn’t the one that truly helps your business grow where it matters most.
