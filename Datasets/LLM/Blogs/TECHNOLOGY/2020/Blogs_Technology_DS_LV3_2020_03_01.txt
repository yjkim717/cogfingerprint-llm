The year 2020 forced us all to slow down, and in that quiet space, I found myself reflecting on something unexpected: how technology became the very thread stitching our family together. My sister, halfway across the country and pregnant with twins, felt farther away than ever. Our weekly video calls became our sanctuary. We’d speculate wildly about her babies’ futures, our conversations often drifting to the Star Wars sequels we’d just watched, debating the potential of a new generation born from characters like Rey and Ben.

It struck me then that our screens weren't just cold glass and data. They were portals. They carried the weight of our hopes and the echo of our laughter across thousands of miles. In a time of profound isolation, this technology didn't create distance; it defiantly bridged it, allowing us to share in the intimate, anxious, and joyful anticipation of new life. It was our own personal Force, connecting us to the people who mattered most.
