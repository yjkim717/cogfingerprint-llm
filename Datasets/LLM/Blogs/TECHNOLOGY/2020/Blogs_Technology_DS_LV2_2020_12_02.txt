Of course. Here is a reflective blog post that connects the linguistic theme to a personal technology experience in 2020.

### The Ghost in the Machine (and My Phone)

It’s 2020, and I’m having more conversations with my phone than with people. I say “Hey Siri,” and it feels less like a command and more like a greeting to a ghost in the machine. It got me thinking about a dusty old linguistics paper I once read, about how pronouns in some languages started as separate words but eventually fused into the verbs themselves, becoming inseparable.

That’s exactly what’s happening with our tech, isn’t it? “Hey Siri” or “Okay Google” aren’t just commands anymore; they’ve become grammaticalized. They’re the new linguistic clitics, the little verbal handles we use to activate the digital part of our world. We don’t think about them; we just use them. They’ve been incorporated into the very fabric of our daily grammar.

It’s a little unsettling, but also fascinating. In this year of isolation, these digital assistants have become our most constant companions, their trigger phrases woven into the rhythm of our lives. The line between our language and the machine’s is blurring, and I can’t help but wonder what we’re building, one seamless command at a time.
