**The Ghosts of Innovation**

Remember staring at a complex gadget, wishing you understood *how* it worked? I was thinking about that recently while reading about the Atlanteans and their ZPMs – these incredible, lost technologies. It struck me: they had the blueprints, the data… but no instructions! 

It’s a weird parallel to our own tech world. We build on the work of giants, accumulating mountains of “databases” of knowledge, yet sometimes it feels like we’re just repeating steps without truly grasping the underlying principles.  Maybe the best innovations aren’t just about *what* we build, but *why* we build it.
