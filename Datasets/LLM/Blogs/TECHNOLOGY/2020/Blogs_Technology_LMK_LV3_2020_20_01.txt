"As a non-traditional CS major starting my freshman year in 2020, I couldn't help but feel a bit anxious about my career prospects. With the ever-evolving tech landscape, I worried that I was already behind the curve. Would I be able to secure internships and build a competitive resume? I confided in peers from traditional CS programs, and they seemed to have a clear roadmap ahead. Meanwhile, I was navigating a different academic path, trying to stay on track. But as I dove deeper into coding and exploring various tech fields, I realized that my unique journey could be a strength. I'm learning to leverage my non-traditional background to stand out, and I'm excited to see where this path takes me. By embracing my differences, I'm turning what felt like a weakness into a valuable asset in the world of computer science."
