Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and the 2020 context, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone:

**The Glow of the Screen, the Shadow of Sleep**

Remember 2020? It felt like the world was holding its breath, didn’t it?  We were all huddled around our screens, trying to stay connected, informed, and…well, sane. And honestly, I think my little Leo was struggling *because* of it. 

We’d just hit that tricky 3.5-year-old stage, and sleep had become a battlefield. Bedtime battles were epic – a refusal to brush teeth, a desperate plea for “just one more story,” and then, inevitably, a frantic scramble to the floor. I was running on fumes, fueled by caffeine and a growing sense of panic. 

Then, I noticed it. Leo was spending *hours* before bed glued to YouTube Kids.  Cute animal videos, silly songs… it was a temporary distraction, sure, but it was also rewiring his brain.  His nighttime routines, which were already shaky, completely dissolved into a screen-induced haze. 

It hit me: we were using technology to soothe, but it was actually fueling the very thing we were trying to fix.  It was a stark reminder that sometimes, the most helpful thing we can do for our kids – and for ourselves – is to step away from the glow.  It wasn't easy, but turning off the tablet and rediscovering the quiet comfort of a book (and a slightly grumpy toddler) was a small victory in a chaotic year.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (e.g., a particular parenting technique)?
