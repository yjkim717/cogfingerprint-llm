As I upgraded my gaming PC in 2020, I realized it was time to part with my trusty old components. Selling my used MSI motherboard and Ryzen 5 CPU felt like a milestone, but it was a necessary one - I needed the cash to fund my grad school applications. It's funny how technology can be both a passion and a means to an end. As I packed up my old hardware, I reflected on the late-night gaming sessions and the countless hours spent tweaking settings. Now, those components would help me take the next step in my academic journey.
