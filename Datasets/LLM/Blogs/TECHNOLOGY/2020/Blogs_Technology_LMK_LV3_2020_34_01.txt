"Disconnected in a Connected World: My Struggle with Screen Time"

As I navigated the challenges of parenting in 2020, I found myself torn between leveraging technology to ease the burden of childcare and worrying about its impact on my child's well-being. With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing us into lockdown, screens became our windows to the world, and I relied heavily on them to keep my 3.5-year-old occupied. However, this came at a cost â€“ disrupted sleep routines and exhaustion became our new normal. Despite setting limits and encouraging offline activities, I struggled to strike a balance. As I reflect on those trying times, I realize that it's not just about managing screen time, but also about being mindful of its effects on our family's overall health. By sharing my experience, I hope to spark a conversation about finding that delicate balance in a world where technology is both a blessing and a curse.
