"Zoom meetings have become the new norm in 2020, and as someone who's spent countless hours on video calls, I've encountered my fair share of audio issues. Recently, I faced a frustrating problem while using my iPad Pro with iOS 13 to join a Zoom meeting via a Bluetooth speaker. The audio quality was subpar, with a tinny and distant sound that made it hard to engage with the conversation. To make matters worse, the issue persisted even when I switched to Google Meet. After some trial and error, I realized that the problem was specific to Bluetooth audio on my iPad Pro. While I've since found workarounds, I'm still puzzled by this glitch. Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Bluetooth audio on iOS 13? I'm curious to know if there's a fix on the horizon to improve the audio quality and make virtual meetings a more seamless experience."
