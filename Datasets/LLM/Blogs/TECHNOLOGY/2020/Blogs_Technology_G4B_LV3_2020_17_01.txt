**The Sticky Note Paradox**

Remember those beautiful, overflowing stacks of physical notes? I do. I was clinging to my Galaxy Tab S7+ like it held the key to my productivity in 2020, furiously scribbling ideas and meeting minutes. But then a nagging worry crept in: what happens when the tablet dies, or the software changes? Suddenly, all those brilliant thoughts felt… trapped.
