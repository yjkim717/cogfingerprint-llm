Of course, here is a reflective blog post from the perspective of 2020.

Remember when we thought technology was our ticket to a perfectly efficient life? In 2020, it became something else entirely: our tether.

My phone used to be a distraction, a portal to endless scrolling. Now, it’s the window where I see my parents’ faces, the classroom for my kids, and the office I haven’t physically visited in months. The same apps that once fragmented our attention are now the very tools holding our world together.

It’s funny, isn’t it? We spent years building these digital bridges, and we never realized how much we’d need them until the physical ones felt too far to cross. Technology didn’t just make things easier this year; it made the essential possible. It became less about the specs and more about the connection. And for that, I’m more grateful than I ever thought I’d be.
