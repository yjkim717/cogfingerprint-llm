**The Invisible Fine Print: When Tech Promises Fall Flat**

Remember 2020? We were all desperate for a little stability, a little *something* good in a world turned upside down. I, like many, jumped at the chance for a new phone – a shiny upgrade promised by AT&T. It seemed simple enough: trade in my old one, get a discount, and boom – new phone. 

But that’s when things started to unravel. What began as a minor billing glitch quickly spiraled into a frustrating battle, fueled by what felt like deliberate deception. The promised trade-in value vanished, and suddenly I was staring down a hefty bill *and* a lost free phone. 

It’s a stark reminder that in the digital age, even the most enticing tech offers come with invisible fine print. It’s easy to get swept up in the excitement, but we need to be vigilant, reading the details – and trusting our gut – before we commit.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?
