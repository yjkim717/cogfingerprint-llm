## The Great JS File Consolidation of '20

Remember those days of sprawling project folders, overflowing with *so many* JavaScript files? I certainly do. Early 2020, I was wrestling with a particularly gnarly web project, and the sheer number of `.js` files felt like a personal affront. Each one held a tiny piece of functionality, and importing them all felt… chaotic.

Then it hit me: why not consolidate? I started bundling them into a single file, and honestly, it was a small change with a surprisingly big impact. Suddenly, the project felt cleaner, more manageable. And I *think* it even helped with load times, though proving that definitively was another story. 

It’s funny how sometimes the simplest optimizations can make the biggest difference. It’s a reminder to always look for those little ways to streamline, to bring order to the digital chaos. Anyone else feel that way?
