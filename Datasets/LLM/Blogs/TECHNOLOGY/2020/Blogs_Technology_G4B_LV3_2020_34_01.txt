**The Glow of the Screen & the Ghosts of Sleep**

Remember 2020? It felt like a year of constant adaptation, didn’t it? And for us, that adaptation hit a particularly painful spot: bedtime. Our little guy, Leo, suddenly decided 3.5 was the *perfect* age to fight bedtime with the ferocity of a tiny, sleep-deprived dragon. 

It wasn’t just bedtime battles, though. It was the creeping influence of screens – endless YouTube videos, a tablet before bed – all fueling the sleep regression. We were exhausted, constantly chasing the ghosts of a peaceful night’s sleep. 

Looking back, it’s clear we were trying to fill the quiet with noise, hoping to soothe the anxiety that was keeping him awake.  Ironically, the very technology meant to entertain him was actively disrupting his – and our – sleep. It’s a lesson learned, and one I think resonates with so many parents navigating the chaotic joy of early childhood.
