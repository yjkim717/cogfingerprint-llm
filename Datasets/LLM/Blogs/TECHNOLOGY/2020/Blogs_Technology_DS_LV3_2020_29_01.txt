The first time I encountered a “hygienic macro” in a programming language, I felt a wave of relief. It was 2020, and I was deep in a refactoring rabbit hole, trying to untangle a mess of repetitive code. The promise of macros that wouldn’t accidentally capture my variables felt like a safety net. I could automate patterns without fear.

But as the weeks wore on, that safety net started to feel more like a cage. I found myself writing the same boilerplate over and over, just to satisfy the macro’s strict hygiene. The very tool meant to reduce repetition was, in some ways, enforcing it. My code was cleaner globally, but locally, it was cluttered with explicit parameter passing that obscured the simple logic I was trying to express.

That’s when I started flirting with the idea of breaking the rules—of using unhygienic macros. It felt dangerous, like using a power tool without the guard. But in specific, controlled moments, it was beautiful. By allowing a macro to implicitly bind to its surrounding context, I could write code that was breathtakingly concise. The repetition melted away, and the intent of the code shone through, unobstructed by ceremonial scaffolding.

This journey taught me a deeper lesson about abstraction. Sometimes, the pursuit of perfect safety creates its own kind of complexity. The real art isn't in blindly following the rules of macro expansion, but in knowing precisely when to bend them—to trade a little global purity for a lot of local clarity. It’s a delicate balance, but in that balance, you often find the most elegant solutions.
