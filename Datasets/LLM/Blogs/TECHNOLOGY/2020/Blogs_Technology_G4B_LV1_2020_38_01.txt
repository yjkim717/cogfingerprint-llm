**The Algorithm and My Anxiety**

Okay, so 2020. It was… a lot.  Suddenly, everything was online, and job hunting felt like navigating a really confusing maze designed by an algorithm. I was desperately applying for everything – marketing, design, even a few publishing internships. 

I spent hours perfecting my resume, meticulously tweaking every bullet point. Then, I found a typo. A tiny, embarrassing one, but it felt like a fatal flaw. It triggered this weird panic – was my whole future suddenly compromised? 

I reached out to my academic coordinator, a total lifesaver, and she gently pointed out that everyone makes mistakes. She suggested focusing on showcasing my skills, not chasing perfection.  It was a small thing, but it shifted my perspective.  Maybe the algorithm isn’t *always* trying to trip me up. Maybe it's just… complicated.
