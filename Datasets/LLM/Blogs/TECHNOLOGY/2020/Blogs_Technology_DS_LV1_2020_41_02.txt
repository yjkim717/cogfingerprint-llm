### The Day My Phone Almost Broke Me (And How a Human Fixed It)

It was the summer of 2020, and my old phone was gasping its last breaths. Stuck at home, it was my lifeline to everything—work, family, and the increasingly terrifying news. So when AT&T ran a killer trade-in promo, I pounced. The promise was simple: send in my ancient device, get a shiny new one, and a hefty promo credit to cover it.

The new phone arrived, a sleek little rectangle of hope. I mailed my old one back, feeling savvy. Then the bill came. No credit. I called customer service, was put on hold for what felt like an eternity, and was finally told my trade-in "didn't qualify." I was furious. In a year where we felt so powerless, this was the last straw.

I did what any desperate person would do: I went full detective. I found a local store manager's email and poured my heart out in a message—not with anger, but with the sheer exhaustion of it all. I explained the situation, the promo, the hours on hold. To my shock, he replied. He couldn't fix it himself, but he escalated it to his district manager.

A week later, my phone buzzed. It was an email from AT&T. The credit had been applied. Not only that, but the entire cost of the phone was wiped clean. I nearly cried.

The tech was the goal, but the victory was human. In a world increasingly automated, a single person taking ownership made all the difference. My new phone got me through 2020, but that small act of human connection is what I’ll really remember. It was a reminder that behind the apps and algorithms, people can still make things right.
