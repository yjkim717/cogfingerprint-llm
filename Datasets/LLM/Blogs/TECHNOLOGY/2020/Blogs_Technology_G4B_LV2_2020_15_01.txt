**Lost in the Monster’s Lair (and My Own Head)**

Remember 2020? The year everything felt…overwhelming. I was completely sucked into *Monster Hunter World*, loving the challenge, the gorgeous world, and the surprisingly deep combat. But then I’d spend hours learning a new monster’s attack patterns, only to forget them five minutes later. 

It felt like trying to grasp a shifting, digital beast.  I desperately wanted to jump into online hunts with friends, but the learning curve was steep.  Anyone else feel like technology, even a fun game, could sometimes feel more like a frustrating labyrinth?  It’s a reminder to slow down, breathe, and maybe just enjoy the hunt – even if I forget the details later.
