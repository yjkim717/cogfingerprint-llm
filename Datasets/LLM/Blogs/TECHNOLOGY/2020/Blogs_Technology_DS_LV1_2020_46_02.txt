### The Quest for a Quieter Console: Taming Exchange 2016 Alerts

I remember the day our monitoring console looked like a Christmas treeâ€”if Christmas trees were fueled by pure IT panic. It was 2020, and after our Exchange 2016 migration, System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) was screaming about everything. A single hiccup would trigger a dozen alerts, flooding our inboxes and desensitizing the team. We were drowning in noise, missing the real signals.

The turning point was embracing the art of the SCOM override. Instead of letting default thresholds run wild, we got surgical. We focused on key health sets and implemented alert rollup rules, so a single database issue produced one consolidated alert, not a cascade of them. It wasn't about ignoring problems, but about promoting clarity. We shifted from being reactive firefighters to proactive guardians of our messaging infrastructure.

The console is calmer now. The emails are meaningful. It taught me a vital lesson in 2020: true monitoring isn't about collecting all the data; it's about curating the intelligence that lets you actually rest easy.
