There’s a familiar rhythm in the gaming world, one I’ve seen play out time and again in 2020. A developer like Bungie teases a new exotic weapon—a cryptic tweet, a blurred screenshot. And then we, the community, take over. We dissect every pixel, build elaborate theories in forums, and let our collective imagination run wild. We aren't just anticipating a new gun; we're crafting a legend in our minds.

The problem is, we often fall in love with our own creation—the myth, not the reality. So when the weapon finally releases and it’s just a powerful, well-designed tool and not the world-ending god-killer we envisioned, the backlash is swift. "Bungie dropped the ball," we say. "It’s underwhelming."

But I’ve started to wonder: who truly failed to meet expectations? It’s a strange dance of hype and disappointment. Bungie has the near-impossible task of satisfying millions of players with wildly different dreams for the same piece of content. We, the players, have the equally difficult job of managing our own excitement. In a year where so much felt uncertain, these digital worlds became our anchors. Maybe our overhype is just a reflection of how much we care, and our complaints are the sound of that care bumping into the hard edges of reality. It’s a delicate balance, and one I’m still learning to navigate.
