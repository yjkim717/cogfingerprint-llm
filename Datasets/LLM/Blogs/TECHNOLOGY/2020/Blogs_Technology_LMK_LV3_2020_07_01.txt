As I navigated my Shopify store in 2020, I felt a growing frustration - customers were abandoning their carts due to the lack of multicurrency support. Despite Shopify's ease of use, this limitation was costing me sales. I began to wonder if switching to WooCommerce was the answer. But, I had invested so much in Shopify's ecosystem. It was a tough decision, but I knew I had to prioritize ecommerce conversion. Has anyone else struggled with Shopify's currency limitations, and if so, how did you overcome them?
