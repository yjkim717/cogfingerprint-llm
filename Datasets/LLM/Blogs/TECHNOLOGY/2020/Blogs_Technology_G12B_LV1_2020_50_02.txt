## My Unexpected Accent Coach

Remember when video calls felt futuristic? Now, they're justâ€¦ Tuesday. But something surprising happened last year. I started chatting with a lovely Canadian online, purely for language exchange. I'm trying to sharpen my English, and she's learning my native tongue. It's amazing how a simple videochat can not only build connection but also gently nudge you towards better pronunciation. Who knew a pandemic could unlock a personalized accent coach?
