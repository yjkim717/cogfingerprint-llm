## That Lingering Feeling... and My Relationship with Tech

It's funny, the things that trigger anxieties. I recently noticed a tiny imperfection in my new bathroom – a couple of tiles slightly raised around the bathtub, with grout lines that always seem damp. It got me thinking about hidden problems, about things you can’t immediately see. 

And it oddly mirrored my feeling about technology these days. We're all so busy embracing the newest apps, the slickest gadgets, the "seamless" integrations. But are we paying attention to what's lurking beneath the surface? The data being collected, the subtle shifts in our attention spans, the potential for digital dependence?

2020 has been a year of leaning *heavily* on technology, no doubt. But I'm starting to wonder if a little mindful pause is in order – a digital grout check, if you will – before we get completely submerged. Maybe it’s time to address those nagging feelings before they turn into something bigger.
