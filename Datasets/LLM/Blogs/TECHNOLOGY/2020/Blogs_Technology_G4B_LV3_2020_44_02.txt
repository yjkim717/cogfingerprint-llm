**The Quiet Worry of the Digital Glow**

It’s funny how the things we rely on most can also spark the quietest anxieties.  Back in 2020, everyone was glued to their screens – Zoom calls, online shopping, endless scrolling.  I remember my dad, a retired engineer, constantly voicing concerns about the increasing use of X-rays in medical imaging, especially for dental nurses. 

He worried about the cumulative exposure, not just for them, but for all of us.  It felt a little paranoid, I admit, but then my sister mentioned her friend was dealing with a thyroid issue, and suddenly it felt…real.  That little blue glow from our phones, the constant scanning – it made me think about the unseen risks, the potential consequences of a world so thoroughly digitized.  It’s a reminder that progress shouldn’t come at the expense of our well-being, isn't it?
