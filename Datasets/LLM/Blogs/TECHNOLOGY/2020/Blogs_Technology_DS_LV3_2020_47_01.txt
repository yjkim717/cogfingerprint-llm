It’s 2020, and I’m spending more time at home than ever—staring at the same four walls, noticing things I never did before. Like the tiles around my bathtub. A few look slightly raised, and the grout always seems damp, no matter how much I scrub. There’s no obvious leak, but I can’t shake the feeling that water is seeping behind them, silently causing damage I can’t see.

It reminds me of technology in our lives: subtle, persistent, and sometimes invasive. We scroll, click, and connect, unaware of what might be accumulating beneath the surface—data, habits, anxieties. Just like that hidden moisture, what we don’t see can slowly reshape everything. Maybe it’s time to pause and check what’s lurking behind our screens.
