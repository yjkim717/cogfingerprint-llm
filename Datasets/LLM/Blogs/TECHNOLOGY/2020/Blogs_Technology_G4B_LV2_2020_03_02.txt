Okay, here’s a blog post draft, aiming for that reflective, conversational tone and around 175 words, set in 2020:

**The Zoom Glow & the Lost Feeling**

Remember 2020? It felt…sticky, didn’t it? Like everyone was coated in a layer of uncertainty and staring at screens. I was completely consumed by Zoom – lectures, friend catch-ups, even ordering groceries. It was *efficient*, sure, but there was this weird, persistent feeling of…displacement. 

I was studying graphic design at the time, and while the digital tools were incredible, there was something missing. I’d spend hours meticulously crafting designs on my laptop, but it lacked the satisfying *weight* of a pencil on paper, the accidental smudge that sparked a new idea. 

It made me realize how much we trade for convenience. We’re so used to connecting through technology, we forget to actually *feel* connected.  I started making a conscious effort to step away – to wander outside, to draw in a sketchbook, just to reconnect with the physical world.  It was a small rebellion against the endless Zoom glow, and honestly, it felt pretty good.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write one on a different topic?
