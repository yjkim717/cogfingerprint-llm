## The Algorithm and Me: Catching Up in a Digital World

Remember 2020? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? For me, it was the year I finally admitted I was playing catch-up. I'd spent my college years buried in books, chasing a perfect GPA in the humanities. A noble pursuit, sure, but I largely ignored the buzzing world of tech around me. Internships? Not really a priority. 

Now, fast forward a few years, and I'm looking at a landscape transformed. Everywhere I turn, AI, data analytics, and digital storytelling are the keywords. The publishing world, the journalism landscape – it's all interwoven with technology. 

It's a little daunting, honestly. I feel like I missed a crucial chapter. But here's the thing: everyone feels a little behind sometimes, right? This isn’t about regret; it’s about recognizing the shift and adapting. I'm diving in, learning the basics, and realizing that even a humanities background can find a place in this evolving digital world. It’s a new kind of academic pursuit, and I’m ready for the challenge.
