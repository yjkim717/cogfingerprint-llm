As I considered buying a Samsung Tab S7+ in 2020, I found myself stuck on a crucial question: would my favorite note-taking apps play nice with the device? I'd grown accustomed to jotting down ideas and annotating PDFs on my phone, but the thought of upgrading to a larger, more capable tablet was tantalizing. The issue, however, was file format compatibility. What if my go-to apps didn't support the formats used by the Tab S7+? I'd be locked into a single ecosystem, sacrificing the flexibility to access my notes across devices. Data portability is key to a seamless transition. I wanted to ensure that my notes wouldn't be trapped in a proprietary format, forcing me to relearn new apps or worse, lose my data. After some digging, I discovered that many popular note-taking apps did support a range of file formats, giving me the freedom to switch devices without losing my thoughts.
