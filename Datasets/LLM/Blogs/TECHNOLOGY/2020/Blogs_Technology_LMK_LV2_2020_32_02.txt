"As I tinkered with my pfSense setup in 2020, I stumbled upon a challenge: getting my Supermicro LCD display to work. After digging through forums, I realized I wasn't alone in struggling to install the right drivers. The quest led me down a rabbit hole of FreeBSD libraries and LCDproc complexities, all while wrestling with the limitations of USB 1.1. It was a tech puzzle that tested my patience, but ultimately, a valuable learning experience."
