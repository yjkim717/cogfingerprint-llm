### The Unplugged Hour

Remember 2020? The year our homes became our entire world. My phone was my lifeline—a window to friends, work, and the latest news. But it was also a chain.

One evening, my three-year-old was putting her dolls to bed. She held a block to her ear and said, “Shhh, Mommy’s on her phone.” The words hit me like a physical blow. My constant scrolling, my “just one more email,” had become a character in her play.

That was the night I instituted “The Unplugged Hour.” From 7-8 PM, the phones go in a drawer. No notifications, no blue light, just books and Lego towers. It was a struggle at first—my own digital withdrawal was real. But something shifted. The frantic energy of the day melted away, replaced by a quiet connection I didn’t realize we were missing.

The irony isn’t lost on me. It took technology completely saturating our lives to finally show me the profound peace of leaving it behind.
