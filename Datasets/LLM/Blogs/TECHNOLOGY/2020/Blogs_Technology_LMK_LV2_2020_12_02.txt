"Lost in Translation: How Tech is Changing the Way We Communicate"

As I sat in front of my computer screen in early 2020, trying to navigate the nuances of language translation software, I couldn't help but think of the fascinating ways in which languages evolve. Just like the Czech and Malayalam languages, where clitics merge with other words to form new units, our digital communication is undergoing a similar transformation.

With the rise of social media, emojis, and abbreviations, our language is adapting to the fast-paced world of technology. Just as pronouns in Czech and Malayalam have evolved through grammaticalization, our online language is developing its own grammar and syntax. 

In 2020, we're communicating more than ever, yet we're also losing some of the subtleties of human interaction. The tone, the context, and the emotions behind our words are often lost in translation. I'm reminded of the countless times I've misinterpreted a sarcastic comment on social media or struggled to convey my tone in a text message.

As I ponder the impact of technology on our language, I'm struck by the parallels between linguistic evolution and the evolution of our digital communication. Just as languages adapt to the needs of their speakers, our online language is adapting to the demands of our digital lives. As we move forward, it's worth considering how we can harness the benefits of technology while preserving the richness and nuance of human communication.
