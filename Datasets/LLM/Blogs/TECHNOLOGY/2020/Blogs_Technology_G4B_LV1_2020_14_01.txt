**Chasing Ghosts in 480p**

It’s strange, isn’t it? In 2020, I’m spending my evenings trying to *make* something feel old. I’ve built a little setup – an Intel NUC, RetroArch, and a whole lot of tweaking – to get a genuinely retro feel. I’m feeding the output through a VGA cable to a CRT TV.

A little bit of digital archaeology, I guess.
