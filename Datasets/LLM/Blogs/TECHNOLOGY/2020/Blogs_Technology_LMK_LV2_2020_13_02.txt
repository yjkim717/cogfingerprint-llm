"As my Adobe CC subscription teetered on expiration in 2020, I panicked about losing access to my InDesign files. I explored alternatives like Scribus, but file compatibility was a concern. Exporting files became a top priority. I realized that being tied to a single software can be limiting. I've since adopted a more flexible approach, exporting files in multiple formats to ensure continued use, regardless of the software landscape."
