It’s 2020, and I’m knee-deep in my home lab, wrestling with a stubborn Supermicro LCD display. I thought getting it to work with pfSense via LCDproc would be a weekend project—oh, how naive. Hours melted into USB 1.1 speed tests and FreeBSD library rabbit holes. Each error message felt like a personal challenge, a digital ghost I just had to chase. But in those quiet, screen-lit moments, I remembered why I love this: it’s not about the destination, but the gritty, hands-on journey. Sometimes, the struggle is where the real connection happens.
