**The Ghosts in My Old PC**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How attached we get to these little boxes of blinking lights and whirring fans. My old PC – let’s call her Beatrice – has been a steadfast companion for nearly a decade. She’s seen me through countless late nights studying, a ridiculous amount of online gaming, and enough procrastination to fill a small library. 

But lately, Beatrice was starting to groan. The loading screens were painfully long, the games stuttered, and honestly, she just felt… tired.  I realized it was time for a little TLC. 

Recently, I stumbled across a thread online about building a budget gaming PC – something around £300. It felt a little daunting, like tackling a small renovation project.  The thought of swapping out the motherboard and RAM really hit home. It wasn’t about chasing the absolute latest graphics card; it was about breathing new life into something I already loved. 

It reminded me of those old family photos – you know, the ones tucked away in boxes? You look at them and see ghosts of moments past, of people who’ve changed and grown. Beatrice feels a bit like that.  She’s a relic of a different time, but with a few well-chosen upgrades, she can still deliver.  It’s a surprisingly satisfying feeling, rescuing a piece of tech and giving it a second chance.
