It’s 2020, and I’m eyeing the Galaxy Tab S7+ like it’s my ticket to digital nirvana—especially for drowning in PDFs and scribbling notes. But here’s the catch: what if my notes get trapped in some proprietary format, locked away from my laptop or phone? It’s the modern-day equivalent of writing in invisible ink.

I want my thoughts to flow freely, no matter the device. That’s the dream, right? Seamless, cross-platform harmony. Yet, as I weigh my options, I’m reminded that the best tools shouldn’t just be powerful—they should play well with others. Here’s to hoping my digital life doesn’t end up stranded in app limbo.
