### The Unanswered Questions in My Garage

It’s sitting in my driveway, this slab of silent, futuristic slate—my new Rivian R1T. In a year where the world has felt so uncertain, this truck is a tangible piece of tomorrow. I’ve tested its incredible acceleration and marveled at the sheer genius of the Gear Tunnel. It’s a beast that can climb a mountain, yet it feels as quiet as my home office.

But here’s the thing that keeps me up at night, staring out at its dark silhouette. It’s the questions. The "what ifs" of the technology inside.

I’ve poked and prodded the infotainment screen, but I’m left wondering about the soul of the system. What’s the soundtrack to an electric adventure? How seamlessly will it connect to my increasingly digital life? And that forward-facing camera, so clear and promising… it feels like a prelude. The big one, the elephant in the room, is autonomy. What’s the roadmap? In 2020, we’re all craving a clear path forward, and I find myself wanting one from my truck, too.

This isn’t just about specs on a page anymore. It’s about the relationship we’re starting with these machines. The Rivian has proven its muscle. Now, I’m waiting, a little impatiently, to see if it can capture my curiosity with the tech that brings it to life.
