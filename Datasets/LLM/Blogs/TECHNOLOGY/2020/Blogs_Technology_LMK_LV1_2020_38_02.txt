"Breaking into the Tech Industry: My Journey Without a Traditional Background"

As I sat in front of my computer screen in 2020, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. With a degree in Philosophy and English from 2019, I was eager to dive into the tech industry, but my non-traditional background made me wonder if I was at a disadvantage. I had always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and storytelling, and I was determined to make a career out of it.

The problem was, I didn't have any prior internships or experience in the field. I felt like I was starting from scratch, competing against candidates with years of experience and a more relevant educational background. But I was determined to learn and adapt. I began by taking online courses in coding and web development, and I started building my own projects to showcase my skills.

As I navigated this new landscape, I realized that my non-traditional background wasn't a weakness, but a strength. My unique perspective and skillset allowed me to approach problems in a creative way, and I was able to bring a fresh voice to the table. With persistence and hard work, I was able to break into the tech industry, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
