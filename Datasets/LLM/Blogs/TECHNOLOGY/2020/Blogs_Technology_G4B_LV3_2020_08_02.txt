**The Quiet Rebellion of the Volume Down Button**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2020, a year dominated by endless video calls and the constant hum of the internet, finding quiet felt like a monumental task. As someone who’s always been a little…sensitive to the world’s noise – let’s just say Asperger’s has a way of amplifying everything – I was constantly battling sensory overload. 

My family, bless their hearts, just didn’t *get* it. The doorbell, the TV, even just a particularly lively conversation could feel like a physical assault. It led to a lot of frustration, a feeling of isolation, and, honestly, some pretty tough family conflicts. 

I started experimenting with technology, not as an escape, but as a tool.  The “volume down” button on my phone became my lifeline.  Lowering notifications, using noise-canceling headphones – small acts of reclaiming my space.  It wasn’t a perfect solution, of course.  But it allowed me to build a tiny, fragile routine, a pocket of calm amidst the chaos. 

It’s a quiet rebellion, really. A refusal to let the world drown me out.  And in a year that felt so relentlessly loud, that quiet felt like a victory.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing more on a specific coping mechanism or adding a slightly different angle?
