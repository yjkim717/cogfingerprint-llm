Looking back to 2020, I remember setting up our first Shopify store. We noticed customers abandoning carts, forgetting discount codes at checkout. So we automated a 10% post-purchase discount for them. It felt like technology wasn't just a tool but a thoughtful partnerâ€”gently remarketing with kindness, not pressure. That small tweak reminded me how tech, when used with care, can build loyalty effortlessly.
