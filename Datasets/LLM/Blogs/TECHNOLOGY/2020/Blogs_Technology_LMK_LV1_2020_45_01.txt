"As I dove into the world of Backend as a Service (BaaS) frameworks in 2020, I stumbled upon FatCoach, an experimental framework built with Kotlin. What caught my attention was its unique approach to querying SQL databases. Unlike GraphQL, which has been gaining traction, FatCoach offers a flexible query language that's distinct in both philosophy and architecture. As a developer, I was intrigued by the possibilities it presented. I began to ponder the implications of having a BaaS framework that doesn't follow the GraphQL crowd. FatCoach's innovative query language has the potential to simplify the way we interact with databases. As the tech landscape continues to evolve, I'm excited to see how FatCoach will shape the future of BaaS. For now, it remains an interesting alternative, worth exploring for those looking to shake up their backend workflow."
