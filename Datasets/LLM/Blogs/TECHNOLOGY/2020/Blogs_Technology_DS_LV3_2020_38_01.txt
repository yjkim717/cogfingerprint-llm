The blinking cursor on my screen felt like a tiny, judgmental eye. It was late 2020, and I was staring down my tenth application for a paid tech internship. My resume was a digital patchwork quilt: a front-end development course here, a volunteer project translating app UI there, some light editorial work for a friend’s gaming blog. I’d poured myself into building it, convinced that being a multilingual coder with a knack for clear communication was my golden ticket.

But the doubt crept in. The tech world felt impossibly competitive, a swirling vortex of genius-level coders and startup prodigies. Was my patchwork quilt enough, or was I just handing them a digital napkin? I’d proofread my resume a dozen times, but what if I’d missed a typo? In a sea of applicants, would a single misplaced semicolon in my Python project description be the reason my application got automatically filtered into the void? It felt like trying to shout into a hurricane.

I took a deep breath and closed the tab. The anxiety wasn't about the internship itself, I realized. It was about the transition—the leap from learning in a structured environment to throwing my hat into the real, chaotic ring of the tech industry. My skills weren't a jumble; they were my unique stack. That editorial eye made my code comments cleaner. Those language skills were a bridge to wider user bases. The cursor wasn't judging me; it was waiting. So, I reopened the document, fixed a comma I’d just spotted, and hit ‘submit’ on number eleven. The hurricane would just have to listen.
