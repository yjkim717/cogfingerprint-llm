It’s 2020, and I’m staring down my Adobe Creative Cloud subscription like a looming deadline. Budgets are tight, and that monthly fee stings more than ever. So here I am, scrambling to export my InDesign files before the clock runs out—wondering if free tools like Scribus will feel like a step back or a breath of fresh air. It’s funny how a subscription can make you question what you really need to create. Has anyone else felt this creative crunch?
