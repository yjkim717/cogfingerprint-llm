### The Unexpected Gift of a Silent Feed

It’s funny how the world can get so loud, even when you’re sitting in complete silence. That was my 2020. Stuck inside, the digital noise became deafening. My phone was a firehose of bad news, my social feeds a cacophony of hot takes and performative outrage. Every ping felt like a physical jolt.

My saving grace came from a place I never expected: a clunky, old e-reader I’d dusted off from a drawer. Desperate for an escape, I started downloading classics. No backlit screen, no notifications, no endless scroll. Just words on a pale, grey screen.

In that quiet, single-purpose device, I found a kind of digital silence I hadn’t realized I was starving for. It wasn’t about rejecting technology, but about rediscovering its original promise—connection without the clamor. While the world was learning to Zoom, I was learning to be still. That e-reader became my sanctuary, a small technological bubble where I could process the overwhelming reality at my own pace.

It taught me a crucial lesson as a creator and a human: sometimes, the most advanced tech is the kind that knows when to get out of the way. In a year that demanded we be constantly "on," my oldest piece of tech gave me permission to be off. And it was everything.
