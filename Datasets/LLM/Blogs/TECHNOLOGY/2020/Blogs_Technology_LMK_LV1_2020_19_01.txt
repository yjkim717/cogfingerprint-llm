As I binge-watched the latest Stargate Atlantis episodes in 2020, a question kept nagging me - why didn't the Atlanteans leave behind a blueprint for creating Zero Point Modules (ZPMs) in their database? I mean, think about it, they were fleeing their city in a hurry, and ZPMs were essentially their lifeblood. It seems like a no-brainer to include the schematics for these powerful energy sources in their vast database. 

But, as I pondered this further, I realized it's not that different from our own technological conundrums. How many times have we, as developers or innovators, hesitated to document or share our work, either due to time constraints or concerns about intellectual property? It's a relatable problem, even for ancient alien civilizations like the Atlanteans. Perhaps they, too, faced the challenge of balancing the need for knowledge sharing with the pressure of preserving their legacy.
