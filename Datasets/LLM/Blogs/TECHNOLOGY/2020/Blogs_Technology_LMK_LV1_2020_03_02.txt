Here is a reflective blog post on technology in 2020:

"As I sat in my makeshift home office in 2020, surrounded by laptops and smartphones, I couldn't help but think about how far technology had come. The COVID-19 pandemic had brought the world to a standstill, but tech had kept us connected. I was working remotely, attending virtual meetings, and staying in touch with loved ones through video calls. It was surreal, yet amazing. Just a few years ago, this level of connectivity wouldn't have been possible. I recalled my friends in Brazil, who were struggling to access online resources for their medical studies. I thought about how Germany, with its reputable universities and recognition of foreign diplomas, could be a game-changer for them. Perhaps one day, I'd join them in exploring the possibilities of studying medicine abroad. For now, I was grateful for the tech that kept me going, and the opportunities it presented."
