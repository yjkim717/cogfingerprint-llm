It’s 2020, and I’m sitting here, doomscrolling through another endless feed of curated lives. Each post is a tiny masterpiece—a perfect sourdough loaf, a serene home office, a smiling family in coordinated loungewear. And I can’t help but feel like a puppet.

My phone buzzes, and my hand twitches toward it. An algorithm I didn’t write decides what I see, shaping my worries and wants. But here’s the unsettling part: I’m also the one pulling the strings. I’m the one staging the photos, crafting the captions, performing a version of a life that’s just polished enough.

We’ve built this grand, collective illusion of connection, a digital shield against the quiet dread of a world on pause. But in this silent conspiracy between us and our machines, I sometimes wonder—who’s really in control? Are we the users, or are we the product, happily complicit in our own performance?
