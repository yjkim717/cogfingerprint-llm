Here is a reflective blog post related to technology:

"As I navigated 2020's lockdown, I realized my phone had become a lifeline. But with constant notifications and endless scrolling, I felt suffocated. I started a digital detox, setting boundaries around my screen time. It was liberating to rediscover quiet moments and reconnect with the world around me. Has anyone else found freedom in unplugging? How did you break free from the digital grind?"
