>## The Algorithm and the Commute

Remember 2020? Everything feltâ€¦ uncertain. Even finding a decent parking spot. I was starting my Master's at Waterloo, and the dreaded parking situation was a constant anxiety. I spent *so* much time obsessively checking the university parking app, hoping for a miracle. It was a weird realization: I was letting an algorithm dictate my morning stress levels. Now, I appreciate how much those little digital nudges shaped my day, even if they were mostly frustrating!
