As we navigated the uncharted territories of 2020, it became clear that our relationship with technology was undergoing a significant transformation. Just like the way clitics merge to form a single unit in languages such as Czech and Malayalam, our digital lives were becoming increasingly intertwined.

The pandemic had brought about a seismic shift in the way we interacted, worked, and lived. As we relied more heavily on digital tools to stay connected, our devices and apps began to feel like an extension of ourselves. The boundaries between our online and offline worlds started to blur, and we found ourselves instinctively reaching for our smartphones to navigate the new reality.

This phenomenon is reminiscent of the process of grammaticalization in linguistics, where words or phrases evolve to take on new grammatical functions. Similarly, our technology was adapting to our needs, evolving to become an integral part of our daily lives. The morphology of our digital interactions was changing, with new patterns and habits emerging.

As we looked to the future, it was clear that this merging of technology and human experience was here to stay. The question was, what did this mean for our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world? As we continued to evolve alongside our devices, we were forced to confront the ways in which technology was shaping our language, our relationships, and our very sense of identity. In this new world, the lines between human and machine were becoming increasingly blurred â€“ and it was up to us to navigate this uncharted territory.
