It’s 2020, and my grad school dream at UBC is clashing with my daily reality. I’ve always relied on my car—the freedom, the control. But now, stuck in yet another traffic jam, I’m questioning everything. Is driving from Kitsilano really faster than hopping on a bus? And if I do drive, will there even be a parking spot waiting for me? My phone buzzes with transit alerts, and I wonder if it’s time to let go of the wheel.
