**The Jungle DLC and the Illusion of Challenge**

Remember obsessing over *Minecraft Dungeons*? I did. I loved the frantic combat, the loot drops – until the Jungle DLC dropped. It felt… rushed. Like they slapped a jungle theme on existing content and called it “challenging.”  I’m worried about this trend in gaming – chasing difficulty without actually building something *deep*.  It’s like the game is saying, "Look how hard this is!" instead of, "Here’s a genuine obstacle to overcome.”  Honestly, it left me feeling a little empty. 2020 was already a weird year, and that felt like another layer of manufactured frustration.
