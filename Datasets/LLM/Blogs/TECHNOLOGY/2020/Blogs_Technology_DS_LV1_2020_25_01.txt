It’s 2020, and my classroom Chromebooks are driving me a little crazy. A student’s science video loads perfectly on my old Windows laptop, but on their ChromeOS device? A stubborn, spinning wheel. I’ve checked our Lightspeed web filter—no issues there. I even poked around the developer tools, feeling like a digital detective. It’s a humbling reminder that in our interconnected world, the simplest tech hiccups can still bring learning to a standstill. The problem isn't always the big stuff; sometimes, it's a tiny, elusive glitch.
