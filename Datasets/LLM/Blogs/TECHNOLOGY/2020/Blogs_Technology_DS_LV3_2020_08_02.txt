The notification pinged on my phone—another Zoom link, another attempt to feel connected in the disconnected year of 2020. I remember thinking, *finally, something to break the monotony*. But as I clicked to join, the familiar dread began to creep in.

My Asperger’s means I’ve always had a complicated relationship with noise. Before the pandemic, I could manage it—retreat to a quiet café, take a walk, find pockets of calm. But lockdown erased those escapes. Suddenly, home wasn’t just home; it was my office, my school, my social hub, and my sensory battleground, all at once.

That day, my dad was on a loud business call in the next room, my mom was clattering pans while making lunch, and my brother was blasting video game sounds down the hall. Meanwhile, on my screen, five faces talked over each other, their voices tinny and distorted through my headphones. The sensory overload hit me like a wave—every sound sharpened, intensified, until I couldn’t tell which noise was real and which was digital.

I felt trapped. If I muted the call, I’d feel isolated, cut off from the few people I could still “see.” But if I stayed, the noise would swallow me whole. In that moment, technology—the very thing meant to bridge the distance—had magnified the chaos inside my own home.

It’s a strange paradox, isn’t it? We turned to screens to feel less alone, yet for someone like me, they often highlighted just how overwhelming togetherness could be. Even now, I’m learning to navigate this noisy new world, one deep breath and one carefully scheduled quiet hour at a time.
