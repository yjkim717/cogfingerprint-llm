As a sysadmin in 2020, I was caught off guard when I discovered a student was using their Microsoft account to log in instead of their Active Directory credentials. My initial reaction was concern - how could I prevent this from happening again? I turned to Group Policy Objects (GPO) to enforce Active Directory authentication. Through this experience, I learned the importance of staying vigilant and adapting to new user behaviors. It's a reminder that even with robust systems in place, user authentication can still be a weak link if not properly managed.
