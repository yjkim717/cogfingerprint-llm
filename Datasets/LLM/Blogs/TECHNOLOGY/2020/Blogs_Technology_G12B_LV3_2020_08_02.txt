## The Hum of Everything: When Connection Feels Like Static

2020. The year the world shrunk. Suddenly, our living rooms became offices, classrooms, and the only place we could truly *be*. For many of us, that meant a lot more time spent with family. And for me, someone navigating life with Asperger’s, it meant a whole new level of sensory overload layered on top of an already complicated situation.

Before the pandemic, I'd been actively working on strengthening my relationships with my parents. I felt this pull, this need to connect in a deeper way, to bridge the gap that sometimes exists when you experience the world a little differently. I was excited, even. I pictured cozy evenings, shared meals, and genuinely understanding each other.

The reality, though, was… different.

It wasn’t *them*, not really. It was the *everything*. The constant hum of the refrigerator, amplified by the quiet of being cooped up. The relentless notifications pinging on multiple devices – my phone, my laptop, my dad’s tablet. The news cycle, a constant barrage of anxiety-inducing headlines. The sheer volume of noise, both literal and figurative, became almost unbearable.

I'd find myself retreating, needing to escape the sensory onslaught. I'd put on noise-canceling headphones, bury myself in a book, or lose myself in the glow of a screen – ironically, seeking solace in *more* technology. But even that felt like a temporary fix. The feeling of being overwhelmed just… lingered.

My parents, bless their hearts, didn't quite understand. "Why are you always hiding?" they’d ask. "Why can’t you just relax and watch TV with us?" It wasn't that they were being intentionally dismissive; it was a genuine lack of comprehension of what sensory overload *feels* like. Imagine trying to explain the feeling of a thousand tiny needles pricking your skin – constantly. That’s a fraction of it.

Technology, which I often use as a lifeline to the outside world – to connect with friends who *get* it, to research special interests, to find moments of calming focus – became another source of stress. The pressure to be “present” online, to participate in video calls, to maintain a digital facade of normalcy, felt exhausting.

2020 taught me a lot about resilience, about the importance of self-care, and about the power of setting boundaries. It forced me to confront the reality that connection, even with the best intentions, can be deeply challenging when your sensory system is already operating at maximum capacity. 

And it reinforced a vital lesson: sometimes, the most loving thing you can do for yourself – and for the people who care about you – is to create space. Space to breathe, space to recharge, and space to simply *be*, away from the hum of everything. Even if that means silencing the notifications and retreating into the quiet sanctuary of your own mind.
