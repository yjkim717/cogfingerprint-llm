## The Joy of Unexpected Swords (and a Little Tech Magic)

Remember that feeling of discovery in games? Lately, I've been chasing it in Dark Souls Remastered, thanks to something called "Paramdomizer." It randomly reworks weapon stats and movesets â€“ chaos! It's a bit fiddly to set up (data directories, who knew?), but the thrill of facing a boss with a wildly different arsenal? Pure, nerdy joy. Sometimes, the best tech is the unexpected.
