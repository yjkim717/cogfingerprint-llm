Remember those early 2020 days, when we were all suddenly looking for new ways to connect and create from our living rooms? I found my escape in a quiet corner of the internet: a clever little browser-based strategy game.

It wasn't about flashy graphics; it was about pure, unadulterated engineering. The magic was in the unit composition. Youâ€™d start with a basic chassis and a handful of component sockets, then the real puzzle began. Did I pair that lightweight engine with a long-range weapon, or go for a heavy brawler? It felt like digital Lego, but with higher stakes.

The real breakthrough for me was blueprint crafting. After finally designing a nimble scout unit that actually worked, I uploaded the schematic to the player economy. Seeing another player purchase and use my design was a thrill. In a year we spent so far apart, this game built a community through shared creation. We weren't just players; we were a collective of garage tinkerers, proving that even from isolation, we could build something together.
