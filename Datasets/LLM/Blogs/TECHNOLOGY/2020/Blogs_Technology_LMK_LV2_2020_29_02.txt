"Revisiting C Macros: A Blast from the Past"

As I dug into some old code in 2020, I stumbled upon a peculiar practice - using macros for variable declaration in C programming. It got me thinking, are macros still relevant in modern C programming? I recall the countless hours I spent mastering the C syntax, and how macros were touted as a powerful tool to simplify code. But are they still the best approach? In today's world of advanced programming languages, I'm left wondering if macros have become a relic of the past. I'd love to hear from fellow developers - do you still swear by macros for variable declaration, or have you moved on to alternative methods? Have you encountered any pitfalls or benefits that I should know about? Let's revisit the role of macros in C programming and explore if they're still a valuable asset in our coding toolkit.
