**Remember When We Thought Zoom Was *Crazy*?**

Okay, 2020. Let’s be honest, it felt like a glitch in the matrix, right? Suddenly, everyone was on Zoom, staring at each other through tiny squares. I remember thinking it was utterly bizarre – like a really awkward, pixelated version of a conference call. 

But you know what? It became *essential*. It connected us when we couldn’t be together, allowed us to keep some semblance of work and connection during lockdowns. 

Looking back, it’s strange to think how reliant we’d be on these little video windows now. It was a weird, frantic scramble to learn, to adapt. And honestly, a little reminder that technology, at its best, isn't about replacing human connection – it’s about *finding* ways to strengthen it, even when things are messy.
