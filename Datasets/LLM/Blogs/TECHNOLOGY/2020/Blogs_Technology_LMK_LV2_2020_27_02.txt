"Trapped in a Vortex: My Social Media Struggle in 2020"

As I scrolled through my feeds in 2020, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of despair. COVID-19 updates, stories of racial tensions, and videos of police brutality flooded my screens. I couldn't help but wonder, "Am I the only one feeling this overwhelming sense of frustration and anger?" I felt trapped in a vortex of negativity, unsure how to escape. Has social media become a reflection of our collective anxiety, or is it fueling it? I'm still searching for answers.
