It’s 2020, and my Shopify store was finally gaining traction across Europe—customers in Germany, France, Spain. I felt so global, displaying prices in euros right on the page. But then came checkout.

That’s where the illusion shattered. A customer from Berlin, ready to buy, suddenly sees the total switch back to U.S. dollars. Confusion sets in. Extra clicks, mental math, doubts. I watched it happen in real-time through analytics: abandoned carts piling up like unopened letters.

It hit me hard. All that work to build trust, only to lose it at the finish line. I started wondering—is this costing me more than just sales? Is it costing me relationships with customers who expected a seamless experience?

Now I’m eyeing WooCommerce again. Sometimes, the simplest tech gaps make the biggest difference. And in a world already full of friction, shouldn’t checkout be the easy part?
