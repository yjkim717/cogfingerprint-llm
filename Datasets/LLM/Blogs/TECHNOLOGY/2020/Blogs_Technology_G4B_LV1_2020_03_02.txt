**Remember When Everything Was…Analog?**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 felt *weird*. We were all glued to screens, right? It’s funny thinking back to 2019 – everyone was buzzing about 5G and the metaverse, and it felt like the future was just around the corner. But then…bam! Pandemic. Suddenly, Zoom calls replaced face-to-face meetings, and online grocery shopping became a weekly ritual. 

I was particularly struck by how reliant we became on instant communication. Before, I’d actually *write* letters! Now, it was a rapid-fire exchange of emojis and GIFs.  There was a strange disconnect, a feeling of being simultaneously hyper-connected and utterly alone. 

Looking back, it’s a reminder that technology isn’t inherently good or bad. It’s a tool, and in 2020, it amplified both the best and worst of humanity. It made us resilient, yes, but also highlighted our need for genuine connection beyond the digital world.  Anyone else feel like 2020 completely shifted our relationship with tech?
