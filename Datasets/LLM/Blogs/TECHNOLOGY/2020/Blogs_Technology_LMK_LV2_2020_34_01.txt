"The Pandemic Screen Time Struggle is Real"

As we navigated the unprecedented lockdowns of 2020, my toddler and I found ourselves glued to screens more often than not. With playdates canceled and playgrounds closed, our daily routine revolved around tablets and smartphones. At first, it was a lifesaver - endless cartoons and educational apps kept my little one occupied while I worked from home. But as the weeks turned into months, I started to worry about the impact of excessive screen time on my child's developing brain. The constant stream of notifications, the blue light disrupting our bedtime routine... it was taking a toll on both of us. I'm not alone in this struggle, am I? How have you managed to balance screen time with family time during this pandemic?
