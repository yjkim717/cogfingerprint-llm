**The Weight of Every Click (2020)**

Remember 2020? It felt like the world was glued to screens, and I was obsessing over something a little… unsettling: privacy. I was chatting with a friend who’s a serious privacy advocate, and he was wrestling with how to collect website data ethically. It wasn’t about just slapping up a cookie banner. 

He was digging into things like IPv4 masking and analyzing timestamps – trying to understand *how* we were tracking users without feeling like we were invading their space. It struck me – every click, every page view, it all carries a tiny weight.  GDPR compliance felt less like a checkbox and more like a constant, careful consideration.  It was a reminder that technology, for all its convenience, demands accountability.
