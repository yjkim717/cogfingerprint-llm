## Is My App Lying About My Dividends? A Trading 212 Quandary

Okay, so I’ve been playing around with Trading 212 for a while now, enjoying the ease of it all. But something’s been bugging me. The app was showing a surprisingly decent dividend yield for Rolls Royce. Now, I know the market's been *wild* in 2020, but I did a little digging elsewhere and... things didn't quite line up. 

It got me thinking - how reliant are we becoming on these apps for our financial info? Are we blindly trusting the numbers? It’s a good reminder to always double-check, right? Anyone else experienced this?
