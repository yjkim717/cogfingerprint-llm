"As I set up my Intel NUC to play classic games on my trusty CRT TV via VGA, I wondered: does RetroArch truly capture the essence of vintage consoles? I loaded Lakka and started playing, and while the visuals and controls were spot on, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. The nostalgic warmth of old consoles is hard to replicate. Still, the convenience and flexibility of RetroArch on my NUC made for a compelling retro gaming experience. Was it authentic? Maybe not entirely, but it was darn close."
