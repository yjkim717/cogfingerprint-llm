It’s 2020, and I’m thinking about how much of our lives now revolve around screens and software—even the vehicles we drive. Lately, I’ve been captivated by the Rivian R1T. On paper, it’s a beast: incredible towing strength, serious off-road capability, and this rugged charm that speaks to the adventurer in me. But what really has me hooked are the questions buzzing in my mind about its tech soul.

I keep wondering: What’s the infotainment system really like? Will it play nice with my phone and the apps I rely on daily? And those cameras—I imagine them offering a crystal-clear, 360-degree view, turning tricky trails into something manageable, almost intuitive. Then there’s the bigger dream: autonomous driving. In a year where so much feels uncertain, the idea of a truck that can partly drive itself, making long hauls safer and less draining, feels quietly revolutionary.

It’s not just about getting from point A to B anymore. It’s about how technology bridges the gap between raw capability and thoughtful, human-centered design. The R1T seems to sit right at that intersection—powerful enough to handle the wild, but smart enough to keep us connected and confident along the way. Here’s hoping the future feels this thoughtful.
