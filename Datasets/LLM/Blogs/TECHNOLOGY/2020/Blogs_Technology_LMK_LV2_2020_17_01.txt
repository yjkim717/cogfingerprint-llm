"Switching to a New Tablet: Will My Notes Be Left Behind?

As I considered purchasing a Samsung Tab S7+ in 2020, I couldn't help but think about my note-taking habits. With a device change, I was worried about being locked into a specific file format, making my notes inaccessible across different platforms. I wanted the flexibility to read PDFs and jot down notes without being tied to a particular ecosystem. The Tab S7+ seemed like a great device, but I needed assurance that my notes would be compatible with my other devices. I realized that the key to a seamless transition lies in choosing a note-taking app that supports cross-platform compatibility and open file formats. After some research, I found a few apps that fit the bill, giving me the confidence to make the switch. If you're in a similar dilemma, I'll share my findings and help you make an informed decision."
