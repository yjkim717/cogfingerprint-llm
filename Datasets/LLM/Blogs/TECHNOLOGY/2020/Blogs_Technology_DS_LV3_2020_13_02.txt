Remember that frantic week in 2020, racing against my expiring Adobe subscription? My entire portfolio was trapped in InDesign files, and my budget was shot. I felt a familiar panicâ€”so much of my creative identity was locked behind that paywall. It was a stark reminder of how our digital tools can hold our work hostage. I spent days learning to export everything, a bittersweet liberation. Letting go was hard, but it taught me a valuable lesson about building a creative life that isn't dependent on a single subscription.
