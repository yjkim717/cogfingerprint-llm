## The Frustration of the Unseen Change

Anyone else feel like technology moves at warp speed these days? I spent a good chunk of yesterday wrestling with Microsoft Teams, specifically trying to schedule a live event. Confirmed I had the right permissions, triple-checked everything… and nothing. It was incredibly frustrating! 

It got me thinking – how often do we, as admins, just *react* to changes we don't fully understand? Is it a delay, a bug, or has a feature quietly vanished? It's a reminder to breathe, document, and maybe reach out to the community. We’re all navigating this digital evolution together!
