### The Unexpected Grind

Itâ€™s funny how the world works. In 2020, my quest for productivity led me down a rabbit hole of new apps and digital workflows. I was on a personal Ironman mode, determined to emerge from lockdown with a new skill or a polished side-project.

But the grind wasn't what I expected. The real challenge wasn't mastering the apps; it was learning to be graceful with myself when the notifications piled up and my focus wavered. The "b-gloves" of a perfect digital routine kept slipping.

In the quiet moments between Zoom calls, I found a different kind of achievement. It wasn't about ticking off every quest on my to-do list, but about rediscovering the simple, unoptimized joy of reading a book or just being still. Sometimes, the most productive upgrade is a downgrade in expectations.
