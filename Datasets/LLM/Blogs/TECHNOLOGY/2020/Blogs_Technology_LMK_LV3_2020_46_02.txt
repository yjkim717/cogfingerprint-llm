As we navigated the challenges of 2020, IT teams were on the frontlines, ensuring our organizations' email infrastructures remained robust and reliable. For many, Microsoft Exchange 2016 was the backbone of their email services, and System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) was the tool of choice for monitoring its health. But with great power comes great complexity - and a deluge of alerts. Have you ever found yourself drowning in a sea of notifications, struggling to separate the signal from the noise?

Effective monitoring is not just about having the right tools, but also about configuring them correctly. As I reflected on our own SCOM setup, I realized that alert consolidation and override configurations were crucial to avoiding alert fatigue. By implementing best practices around health sets and overrides, we were able to streamline our monitoring, reduce noise, and focus on the issues that truly mattered. In this post, I'll share our journey and the lessons we learned along the way.
