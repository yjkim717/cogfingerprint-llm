### The Hype Machine and My First Smart Speaker

I remember unboxing my first smart speaker in early 2020, my fingers practically buzzing with anticipation. I’d spent weeks watching slick promo videos and reading breathless reviews. This little cylinder, I was convinced, was going to be my personal Jarvis. It would streamline my life, play the perfect song for my mood, and basically usher in the sci-fi future I’d always dreamed of.

The reality, as it often is, was a little more… mundane.

Sure, it told me the weather and set timers while my hands were covered in flour. But it also misheard "play some chill music" as "play some child music" more than once. I found myself getting irrationally annoyed. Why couldn't it just *understand* me? It took a moment of frustration, staring at this unassuming device, to realize the problem wasn't the technology.

It was me. I had pre-written the entire script for our relationship in my head before I’d even plugged it in. The tech world’s hype cycle—and my own willingness to buy into it—had set us both up for failure. I wasn’t interacting with a product; I was comparing it to an impossible fantasy. Letting go of that fantasy was the real upgrade. Now, when it successfully adds oat milk to my shopping list, it feels like a quiet victory, not a failed revolution.
