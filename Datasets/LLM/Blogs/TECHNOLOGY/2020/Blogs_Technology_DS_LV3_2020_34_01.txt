The glow of the baby monitor app was my constant companion in 2020. My 3.5-year-old had declared war on sleep, and I was losing. We had the perfect routine—bath, books, lullabies—but every night was a fresh battle, ending with me slumped on the floor, scrolling through desperate texts to the pediatrician’s portal.

My phone became a digital anchor of exhaustion. I’d research sleep-training methods during 2 AM resistance, only to be woken by a tiny dictator at 5:30 AM. The promised land of consolidated naps felt like a myth from a pre-pandemic world. In a year where the world slowed down, our household was stuck on a frantic, sleep-deprived loop, all tracked and exacerbated by the very technology that was supposed to make life easier. I was more connected than ever, yet utterly drained.
