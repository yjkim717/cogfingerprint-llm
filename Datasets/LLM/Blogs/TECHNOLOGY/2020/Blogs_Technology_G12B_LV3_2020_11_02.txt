## Digging Through the Digital Dust of 2b2t

It’s funny what obsesses people online, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been fascinated by this project within the 2b2t community – a meticulously crafted interactive timeline. Someone built a whole archive, weaving together blog posts and resources to chart the server’s history. It’s a beautiful example of how technology can preserve and even *animate* collective memory, even in the most unexpected corners of the internet. Makes you wonder what digital legacies *we’re* building.
