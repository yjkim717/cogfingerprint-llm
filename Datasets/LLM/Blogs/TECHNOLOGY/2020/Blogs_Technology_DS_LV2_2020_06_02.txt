It’s 2020, and I’m juggling work deadlines, helping my kids with remote school, and trying to finish my Xenogears YouTube series. Part 3 has been sitting in my editing timeline for weeks, a puzzle of game analysis clips and half-finished narration.

Some nights, after everyone’s asleep, I sneak to my desk. The soft hum of my PC is a familiar comfort. I’m stitching together thoughts on Fei’s journey while my own life feels equally fragmented. It’s in these quiet hours that I realize something: this isn’t just about finishing a video. It’s about holding onto a piece of myself—the creator, the gamer, the thinker—amidst the beautiful chaos of family life.

Technology, for all its noise, gave me this quiet space to create and reflect. And for that, I’m grateful.
