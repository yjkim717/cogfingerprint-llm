## Wrestling with the Database: Why I'm Playing with FatCoach (and Maybe You Should Too)

It’s late 2020, and the JavaScript fatigue is *real*. We’re all juggling frameworks, build tools, and constantly battling the impedance mismatch between our front-end and backend.  I’ve been feeling it acutely while building a little side project – a habit tracker, nothing fancy. And the constant back-and-forth with SQL queries was just… draining.

That’s when I stumbled upon FatCoach. It’s this intriguing, experimental Kotlin-based Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) framework, and the core idea really resonated with me. The goal? To give front-end devs a more intuitive way to interact with the database, essentially abstracting away the SQL complexity. Think a flexible query DSL you can use directly in your JavaScript, without needing to constantly translate your thoughts into SQL syntax.

Right now, it's early days – the documentation is sparse, and the learning curve is definitely there.  It leverages Kotlin, which is already a language I appreciate, and uses GraphQL for data fetching, a nice modern touch.  I’m even exploring how to integrate it with jOOQ for more complex database interactions should the need arise.

It’s a bit of a gamble, honestly. But the potential payoff – fewer headaches, faster development, and a happier front-end team – feels worth the investment.  Plus, experimenting with new tech is always a good way to sharpen your skills, right?  Anyone else feeling the pull toward more declarative, front-end-friendly backend solutions? Let's chat!
