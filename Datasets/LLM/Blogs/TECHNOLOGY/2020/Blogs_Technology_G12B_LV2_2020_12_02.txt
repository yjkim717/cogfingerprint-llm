>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a conversational, reflective, and relatable tone, with a 2020 context. I've tried to weave in a subtle nod to the clitics/demonstratives concept without making it overtly academic (as that wasn't part of the request, but it felt like a nice, slightly unexpected connection).  I've included a couple of potential title options at the end.

## The Echo of "Just One More" (or: Why I’m Deleting Apps)

Remember 2020? It feels like a lifetime ago, and yet, also just yesterday. We were all huddled around our screens, leaning *into* technology like never before. Zoom calls, online grocery shopping, endless scrolling… it was a lifeline, for sure. But lately, I’ve been feeling a strange disconnect.

It started with a feeling of… residue. Like little fragments of apps, notifications, and connections were clinging to me, demanding attention. Each "just one more" scroll, each fleeting notification – they felt less fulfilling and more like obligations. It's almost like language itself – think about how words can morph and blend over time, losing their original meaning.  These apps, these platforms… they’ve kind of done that to my attention.

So, I'm doing a digital declutter. I’m deleting apps I barely use, muting notifications, and consciously choosing *not* to click on everything that pops up. It feels surprisingly liberating. It's not about rejecting technology entirely; it's about reclaiming my focus, my time, and a little bit of quiet in a world that’s constantly vying for it. Maybe 2021 can be about intentional connection, instead of just constant response.

What about you? Have you felt that digital residue lately?
