It’s funny how quickly a game can feel… frustrating. I was digging into GunsofBoom the other day, and I hit a wall with one of the weapons. It felt like it demanded a level of pixel-perfect pre-aim and charging that just wasn’t fun.  Seriously inconsistent damage? It made me think about how much of our time online is spent chasing that elusive “perfect” execution, instead of just enjoying the flow.  Anyone else feel that lately?
