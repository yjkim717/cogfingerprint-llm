Remember those early 2020 Zoom calls? My family's faces, pixelated and frozen, were tiny windows into a world I couldn't touch. My phone became a portal to everythingâ€”news, groceries, distant friends. But the constant scroll through rising case numbers and social unrest left me feeling hollow. The very technology that promised connection began to fuel a deep-seated frustration. I had to learn to put the screen down, to step away from the digital anger and just breathe. The silence was a relief.
