As a Shopify store owner in 2020, I struggled to boost sales from repeat customers. Many forgot to apply their discount codes at checkout. To tackle this, I turned to remarketing strategies and automated customer support. By setting up a post-purchase discount code application, I not only increased customer satisfaction but also encouraged repeat business, fostering a loyal customer base.
