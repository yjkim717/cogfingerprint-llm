**The Quiet Shift: How Tech Feels Less Like “Doing” and More Like “Being”**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Looking back to 2020, the year everything felt… paused. We were all desperately trying to *do* things online – connect, learn, shop, work. Every click, every notification, felt like a deliberate action. Now, in 2023, it feels…different. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about how our relationship with technology has subtly shifted. Remember the initial excitement of mastering new apps, the satisfaction of conquering a complex spreadsheet? Now, it often feels less about *doing* and more about *being*. 

Think about Spotify – you don’t “make” a playlist, you *are* in a mood and Spotify responds. Or Instagram – you don’t "post" a photo, you’re simply *sharing* a little piece of your life. 

It’s a little like the research I read about clitics in languages like Czech and Malayalam – a process of gradual merging, where words become less distinct. Technology is doing something similar, folding into the background of our lives. 

Maybe that’s not a bad thing. Maybe it's just a quieter, more integrated evolution. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most profound changes happen not through grand gestures, but through these tiny, almost imperceptible shifts in how we interact with the world around us.
