### The Unseen Grind

It’s 2020, and my world has shrunk to the size of a screen. In the quiet chaos of lockdown, I created an Ironman account in Old School RuneScape. The appeal was its brutal self-sufficiency: no trading, no help. Just me and the world.

I blasted through the early quests, a clear checklist of accomplishments. But when the last quest requirement was met, a strange emptiness set in. The game didn’t tell me what to do next. I was directionless, staring at the vast map from Lumbridge.

That’s when I found my grind. Not for a rare drop, but for the Graceful outfit—hours of running laps around a rooftop agility course. It was monotonous, meditative. In a year where the outside world was on hold, this digital repetition became my anchor. The goal wasn't the destination of "Barrows Gloves" or a high-level boss; it was the quiet dignity of the process itself. In seeking a virtual sense of purpose, I was unknowingly building a real one, one graceful step at a time.
