**The Scroll That Almost Stole My Dreams**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… paused, right? I was staring at a blank screen, wrestling with my PhD application. Specifically, my *statement of purpose*. It was a dry, robotic thing – all perfectly-formed sentences and vaguely impressive buzzwords. 

I was so focused on *sounding* like a serious academic, I’d forgotten to actually *show* my passion.  It was only after a friend gently pointed out how “dry” it felt, that I scrapped it and started again.  Sometimes, the most powerful stories aren’t crafted, they’re just… remembered.  Lesson learned: authenticity wins.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different style of post?
