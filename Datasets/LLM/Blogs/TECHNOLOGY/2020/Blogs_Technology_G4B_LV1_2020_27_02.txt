**Scrolling Through the Storm**

Honestly, 2020 felt like perpetually wading through a thick fog. The news was a constant barrage of anger – about the pandemic, about the political shouting matches, about feeling utterly powerless. I spent way too much time scrolling, convinced I could somehow *understand* it all, control it all, through Twitter and Facebook. 

It just fueled the frustration, though. Each perfectly-crafted argument, each outrage post… it felt like shouting into a void. I realized I was less informed and more just… angry.  Taking a break from the screen was the only way to actually breathe.
