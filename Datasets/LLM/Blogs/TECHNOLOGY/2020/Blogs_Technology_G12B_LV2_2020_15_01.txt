## The Algorithm Knows I Miss Travel

It's funny, isn't it? How technology, for all its promise of connection, can sometimes just… highlight what you’re missing. Lately, my Instagram feed has been aggressively showcasing sun-drenched beaches and cobblestone European streets. I get it, algorithms. You’ve noticed I haven’t left my apartment in, well, months. 

2020 has been a strange teacher. We’ve all learned a lot about resilience, sourdough bread, and the surprising comfort of video games. But there’s a quiet ache too, a longing for the spontaneity of packing a bag and just *going*. 

It’s not just the places, it's the *feeling* of those places. The buzz of a foreign market, the smell of rain on ancient stone. I wonder if the algorithm will ever figure out how to deliver *that*. Maybe not. Maybe the best way to get it back is to just start planning, even if it's a daydream for now.
