It was early 2020, and my team was tasked with extending our SCOM monitoring to new child domains in APAC and China. The question hit us immediately: do we create a whole new management group or deploy gateway servers?

I remember staring at network diagrams, the word "latency" echoing in every discussion. A second management group felt clean, independent. But those gateway servers promised a more unified view. It wasn't just a technical choice; it was about connection. In a year when the world was suddenly feeling more distant, our biggest challenge was ensuring our technology wasn't. We were making a decision that would either bridge that gap or widen it, all for the sake of performance and a stable, responsive pane of glass for our colleagues halfway across the globe. It was a powerful reminder that in IT, the most logical choices are often deeply human.
