It was late 2020, and I was deep in a USACO contest, convinced my algorithm was solid. But that dreaded "timeout" message kept appearing. I’d already streamlined loops and cut duplicate arrays—what more could I do? In a moment of frustration, I tried something counterintuitive: reversing my approach. Instead of pushing data forward, I pulled it backward. Suddenly, everything clicked. The optimization wasn’t just about trimming code; it was about rethinking the problem entirely. That night taught me that sometimes the most elegant solutions come from looking at things from a completely different angle—even in programming.
