Remember those early pandemic days in 2020, when we all retreated into our screens? I found myself on 2b2t, that chaotic Minecraft server. It was a digital ghost town, a perfect escape. I started using its new timeline feature, posting little archives of my builds and thoughtsâ€”like a digital diary. It was strangely comforting, creating a small, permanent mark in a world that felt so uncertain. Funny how a blocky game became my most human connection that year.
