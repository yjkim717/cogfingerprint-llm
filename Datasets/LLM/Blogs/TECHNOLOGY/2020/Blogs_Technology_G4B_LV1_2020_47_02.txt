**The Ghost in the Wireless**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with a seriously frustrating tech gremlin lately. It’s a Logitech wireless mouse – a perfectly decent one, mind you – and it’s developed this *random* lag. Not constantly, but just…popping up at the worst possible moments. 

I spent a solid afternoon last week diving into driver updates, reinstalling everything, the whole nine yards. It felt like I was chasing a ghost.  I even tried plugging in a USB mouse just to rule it out, and that worked flawlessly. 

It’s weird, right? You expect your tech to *just work*.  It’s 2020, we’re supposed to be living in a seamlessly connected world. But sometimes, it feels like you’re battling tiny, unpredictable bugs.  Anyone else had this happen with wireless peripherals? Let me know in the comments!

Do you want me to tweak this draft or perhaps write a post on a different angle related to the same core idea?
