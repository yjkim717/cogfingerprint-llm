## The Ghost in My Notifications

It's October 2020, and I’m staring at my phone, a hollow ache settling in. Today was supposed to be… something. A year. Instead, silence. I scroll through old photos, a curated highlight reel of a relationship that fizzled. The worst part? Seeing their online presence thriving, a constant stream of activity that feels like a pointed absence. It’s a strange grief in the digital age, mourning a connection that exists only as a ghost in my notifications.
