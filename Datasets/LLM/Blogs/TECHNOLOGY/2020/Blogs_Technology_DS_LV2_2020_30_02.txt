Balancing that final semester in 2020 was a wild ride. My internship had gone remote, my research project was a digital ghost town, and I was desperately hunting for one last, mercifully easy CS class to keep my scholarship afloat. It felt less like a capstone and more like a high-stakes game of Jenga, praying the tower wouldn't collapse before I could walk away with that degree.
