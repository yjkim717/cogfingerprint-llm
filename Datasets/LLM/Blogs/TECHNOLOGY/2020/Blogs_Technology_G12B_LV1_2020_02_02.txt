>## My Retro Gaming Dreams and Android 11's Storage Walls

Okay, so I'm a bit of a retro gaming enthusiast. Nothing crazy, but I love firing up classic Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS titles whenever I get a chance. For years, my trusty Samsung Galaxy has been my portable emulator powerhouse, running Citra and Drastic flawlessly. Then Android 11 hit.

Suddenly, things got…complicated. It seems Google’s new scoped storage restrictions are throwing a wrench in the works for emulators. My ROMs, previously happily residing on my SD card, are now locked away, inaccessible to Citra and Drastic. 

It's a frustrating reminder that even the coolest tech advancements can have unintended consequences. While I understand the privacy intentions behind scoped storage – keeping user data safe – it’s a real headache for those of us just wanting to relive some pixelated nostalgia. Hopefully, developers will find a workaround soon, because right now, my retro gaming habit is facing a serious storage wall.
