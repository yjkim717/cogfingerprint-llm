I'm still waiting for Rivian to share more about their upcoming models. As an enthusiast, I'm excited about the electrochromic roof and potential mid-range options. However, the lack of pricing details is making it tough for me to plan financially. It's 2020 and I'm not alone in eagerly anticipating updates. I hope Rivian will soon share more information, allowing me to finalize my plans and get ready for this innovative electric vehicle. Transparency will help me and many others make informed decisions.
