**The Scroll and the Storm**

Remember 2020? It felt like a constant, swirling storm of news. Every scroll through social media, every quick glance at the headlines, just… amplified the feeling. I found myself gripped by anger and frustration – a knot in my stomach that wouldn’t loosen. 

I realized I was desperately trying to *stay* connected, to feel like I understood everything happening. But the more I consumed, the more overwhelmed I became. It was a vicious cycle.  Disconnecting felt impossible, like abandoning the conversation.  Maybe, I thought, true connection isn’t about absorbing every detail, but about finding moments of peace amidst the chaos.
