Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a 2020 context. I've focused on the frustration of platform limitations and the consideration of alternatives, reflecting a common sentiment during that period of rapid online growth.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: When Your Platform Feels a Little… Small**

Remember 2020? Everything felt like it was shifting online, *fast*. My little ecommerce shop was no exception. We were seeing amazing growth, which was fantastic, but also brought a new set of headaches. Specifically, currency.

We’d built pretty much everything on Shopify. It was easy, it was popular, it *felt* like the right choice. But as our customer base expanded beyond the US, a glaring limitation became obvious: Shopify’s checkout didn't natively support multicurrency. 

Seriously frustrating. Seeing those abandoned carts pile up, knowing price discrepancies were likely a huge factor… it got me thinking. Was Shopify still the *best* choice? We started seriously looking at WooCommerce again, remembering the flexibility it offered. It felt a bit like going back to basics, but the potential for a truly global checkout was incredibly tempting.

It’s a reminder, isn't it? Even the seemingly obvious choices need revisiting. Technology evolves, and sometimes, the platform you started with just doesn't quite keep up.  The search for the right fit – it’s a constant journey.
