**Lost in the Google Maps Maze**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… uncertain. I was seriously considering applying to UBC grad school, obsessing over details like driving time to Oakridge-Mount Pleasant. I’d meticulously plug addresses into Google Maps, only to be consistently disappointed by the wildly inaccurate estimates. 

It felt like the digital world was deliberately misleading me!  I spent hours researching public transport, frustrated by the conflicting information. It was a surprisingly stressful experience, highlighting how reliant we’ve become on these algorithms – and how easily they can throw you off course.  Anyone else feel this digital disorientation?
