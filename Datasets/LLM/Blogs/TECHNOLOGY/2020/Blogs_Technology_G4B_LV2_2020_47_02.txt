**The Ghost in the Wireless**

Okay, confession time. I was *this* close to throwing my Logitech wireless mouse out the window last week. Seriously. I’d just built a new computer – a glorious, shiny beast of a machine – and suddenly, my trusty mouse was exhibiting the most infuriating behavior: random, inexplicable lag. 

It felt like a ghost was messing with my cursor, slowing everything down to a crawl. I’d tried everything – updating drivers (multiple times!), testing it on my old laptop, even unplugging and replugging it like a desperate techie. Nothing worked. 

It’s funny, isn't it? We rely on these little gadgets so completely, trusting them to be seamless. But sometimes, technology just…doesn’t cooperate. It made me realize how much we *expect* things to just *work*, and how frustrating it is when they don’t.  Maybe it was just a temporary glitch, but that feeling of helplessness was surprisingly powerful.  Anyone else ever experienced a tech tantrum?
