Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and fitting the 2020 context. I've tried to weave in the underlying theme of fertility journeys subtly, as suggested by the keywords, without making it the explicit focus.

## The Algorithm Knows More Than I Thought

It's 2020, and I feel like I'm living in a personalized echo chamber. Remember when targeted ads were just a mildly annoying quirk? Now, they feel…knowing. I was browsing for a new coffee maker last week (desperate for a caffeine boost, let’s be honest), and suddenly my feed was flooded with articles about optimizing routines and creating “intentional mornings.” 

It’s weird, right? Like the algorithm somehow *knew* I was wrestling with a sense of…stagnation. A desire for things to move forward.  I started wondering what else it picked up on.  Maybe it’s reading between the lines of my search history, noticing patterns I haven't even consciously registered. 

It's a little unsettling, but also…kind of fascinating. This technology is reflecting something back to me, even if it’s just a commercialized version of my own hopes. Maybe we’re all just constantly broadcasting our desires, whether we realize it or not.

**Notes on choices made:**

*   **Subtle Connection:** I've alluded to the "trying to conceive" theme through the language of "moving forward" and "desire for things to move," without explicitly mentioning fertility. This connects to the original keywords in a gentle, relatable way.
*   **2020 Context:** The reference to targeted ads and the feeling of living in an echo chamber directly reflects the growing awareness of algorithmic influence in 2020.
*   **Conversational Tone:** I've used phrases like "let’s be honest" and direct questions to the reader to create a more personal feel.
*   **Reflective:** The post focuses on the *feeling* of being observed and analyzed by technology, rather than just describing the technology itself.
