### My Internship Was a Google Doc

It’s May 2020. My diploma, a philosophy degree, sits on my desk. The world is locked down, and my inbox is a graveyard of “hiring freeze” auto-replies. My friends with fancy media internships from college seem to have a foot in the door. My foot, it feels, is in quicksand.

So, I started my own internship. My mentor was a blinking cursor in a Google Doc.

With nowhere to go, I started a tiny newsletter about the ethics of technology during the pandemic. I wrote about contact-tracing apps, the digital divide in remote learning, and the strange morality of Zoom happy hours. It wasn’t for a grade or a byline; it was just me, thinking out loud. I sent it to ten friends. Then twenty.

A few months in, a connection from a philosophy forum asked if they could share it. Then, someone from a small online magazine saw it and asked if I’d write a piece for them. It wasn’t a job offer, but it was a spark.

I learned that in a world where traditional paths vanish, you can pave your own. My “internship” wasn’t at a glossy magazine; it was in the quiet, persistent act of building a portfolio from my kitchen table. And in the end, that document proved I could do the work, pandemic or not.
