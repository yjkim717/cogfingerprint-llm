### The Billion-Dollar Glitch

I was reading about another military tech program getting the axe the other day—something about a next-gen GPS system from Raytheon, billions over budget and years behind. It got me thinking, not as a policy wonk, but as someone who lives in the world of apps and agile development.

In 2020, my phone gets a transformative update every few months. We expect technology to iterate, to fail fast and fix faster. Yet, in the world of major weapon systems acquisition, it feels like we’re still working from a playbook written in the 1980s. The formula seems to be: promise the moon, secure a colossal budget, and then discover the "unforeseen" technical hurdles a decade in.

Where’s the oversight? Where are the checkpoints? In my world, if a project is this off-track, it gets cancelled or radically rebooted long before it bleeds billions. It’s a painful but necessary process.

This isn't just about wasted taxpayer dollars; it's a profound failure of imagination. We're applying a slow, industrial-age mindset to digital-age problems. The real cost isn't just the cancelled program—it's the capability gap it leaves, and the chilling thought that our process is our own worst enemy. We need to stop building monuments and start building adaptable, testable systems, because right now, the biggest vulnerability might just be our own procurement system.
