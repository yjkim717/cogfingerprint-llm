### The Ghost in the Machine: When Features Become the System

Remember the early days of apps? You’d download a simple tool—a calculator, a notepad, a camera. They were separate little helpers, clinking around in your phone like digital clitics. You could delete one without the whole system collapsing.

Then came 2020. Stuck at home, our lives became our screens. I watched my phone’s operating system update, and something clicked. That handy "Assist" button? It’s no longer a separate app I can ditch. It’s woven into the core code, predicting my next move, fused into the user experience. It’s undergone a kind of digital grammaticalization.

This is the tech equivalent of what linguists see in language evolution. A once-independent word, a demonstrative like "that," can morph and fuse until it’s an inseparable part of another word—a bound morpheme. It loses its individuality to serve the whole system more efficiently.

Our apps are doing the same. They’re no longer just tools; they’re becoming bound features of a larger, intelligent organism. It’s incredibly convenient, but it makes me wonder: when a function is no longer optional, when it’s baked so deep into the code that removing it would break everything, what does that say about our control? We’re building systems so seamless that the helpers are becoming the foundation itself.
