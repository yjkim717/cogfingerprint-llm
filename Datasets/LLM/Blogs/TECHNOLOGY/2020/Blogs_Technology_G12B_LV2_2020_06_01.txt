## Remember When "Smart" Just Meant a Pretty Dashboard?

It’s 2020, and I'm pretty sure my fridge is judging my snack choices. Seriously! Everything is "smart" now. My watch tracks my sleep, my thermostat learns my habits… it's a little overwhelming, isn't it?

I was just thinking about my first car – a hand-me-down with a cassette player. "Smart" meant having a decent stereo. Now, I'm debating whether the self-parking feature is worth the extra cost. It’s amazing, of course, but sometimes I miss the simplicity. Anyone else feel like technology is evolving faster than we can keep up?

**Notes on Choices & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Seriously!" and "Anyone else feel...?" to encourage a feeling of connection.
*   **Storytelling:** The post uses a personal anecdote (the first car) to ground the broader reflection.
*   **2020 Context:** The reference to smart fridges and the general feeling of being overwhelmed by technology aligns with the rapid advancements felt around that time.
*   **Word Count:** It's comfortably within the requested range.



I hope this is a good starting point! Let me know if you'd like any revisions or a different angle.
