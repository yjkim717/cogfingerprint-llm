**The Shiny Trap of “Easy” Macros**

Remember 2020? We were all chasing efficiency, desperately trying to squeeze every last drop of productivity out of our workflows. I fell pretty hard for a particular kind of “macro” – those little snippets of code designed for instant convenience. They felt *amazing* at first. Suddenly, repetitive tasks vanished with a single keystroke. 

But then I started noticing something… off. These macros, let’s call them “unhygienic,” were quickly ballooning in scope, creating tangled messes of dependencies. It was like building a beautiful, fragile prototype language just to automate a few simple things. 

I realized I was sacrificing long-term maintainability for a momentary win. Good hygiene in code, just like in life, is about balance. Sometimes, the slightly longer, more structured approach is *way* better in the long run. Lesson learned, and a reminder to build thoughtfully.
