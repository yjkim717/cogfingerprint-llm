**The Thrill of a Secondhand Start**

Remember 2020? Everyone was building PCs! I was too, but my budget was tighter than a drum. So, I took a chance on a secondhand gaming rig – a Frankenstein’s monster of older parts, really. It wasn’t pretty, but it was *mine*. Now, finally upgrading to run those high-res FPS games, I realize that the joy wasn’t about the specs, but the journey of piecing it together. It’s a reminder that amazing things can be built, even on a budget.
