## The Day My Email Almost Vanished (and IPv6 Had Something to Do With It)

Remember 2020? A year of unexpected curveballs, right? Well, mine involved a rather frantic afternoon wrestling with our Exchange server. It started subtly. Reports of emails bouncing, users complaining they weren't receiving things. Nothing catastrophic, but enough to raise an eyebrow.

Digging into the logs, I found a recurring error: “SMTPSend.DNS.NonexistentDomain.”  Immediately, red flags. DNS issues are the bane of any IT professional’s existence. We checked our DNS records, everything *looked* fine. But the errors persisted.

Then came the weird part.  We were seeing a surprising amount of traffic attempting to resolve DNS queries over IPv6. Now, we *supported* IPv6, but it wasn't heavily utilized within our environment.  Turns out, a recent, seemingly innocuous update to our Exchange transport services had inadvertently prioritized IPv6 DNS resolution. And, for reasons we're still unpacking, our external DNS servers weren't fully ready for that increased load – or perhaps, just weren’t handling the IPv6 queries correctly.

It felt like chasing a ghost. Hours were spent tracing packets, scrutinizing configurations. The fix? A simple, but surprisingly effective, restriction on which DNS servers our Exchange server would use, forcing it to stick with our reliable, IPv4-centric providers. 

It was a stark reminder that technology isn't always linear.  Sometimes, a feature designed to improve things can create unexpected problems, especially when ecosystems aren't fully aligned. And in 2020, when reliable communication felt more vital than ever, bringing our email back online felt like a *really* big win.
