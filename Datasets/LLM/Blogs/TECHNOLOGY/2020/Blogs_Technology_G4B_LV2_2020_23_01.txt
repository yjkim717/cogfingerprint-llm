**The Zoom Echo – A Tiny Frustration in a Big Year**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was mediated through a screen. Work, family, friends – all filtered through the glow of Zoom. And I was determined to make those calls *good*. I’d invested in a shiny new iPad Pro, and a sleek Bluetooth speaker, thinking it would finally give me decent audio quality for those endless meetings.

It didn’t. 

I’d get this weird, distorted echo in Zoom, particularly when using the speaker. Everything else – emails, Netflix, even other apps – worked perfectly. It was maddening! It felt like a tiny, specific frustration in the midst of a truly chaotic year. 

It made me realize how easily we can get caught up in chasing the *perfect* tech setup, only to find ourselves battling minor glitches. Sometimes, the best solution is simply to accept that technology isn't always seamless, and to focus on the connection itself, even if the audio isn't flawless.
