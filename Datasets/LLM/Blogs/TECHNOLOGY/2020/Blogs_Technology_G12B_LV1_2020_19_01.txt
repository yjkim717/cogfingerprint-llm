## The Ghosts in the Machine & a Lost City's Oversight

Okay, so I was rewatching *Stargate Atlantis* the other night – yes, I know, peak 2006 nostalgia – and something really bugged me. Atlantis, this incredible underwater city powered by ZPMs (Zero Point Modules, for the uninitiated), just... vanished. Poof. Gone. 

But here's the thing: the Atlanteans were geniuses! They had a massive database filled with literally everything. So why, *why* didn’t they leave detailed schematics for crafting ZPMs in there? 

It feels like a colossal oversight, especially considering the Wraith, those energy-sucking baddies, were just waiting to exploit Atlantis’s power source. You'd think a civilization fleeing destruction would prioritize leaving a blueprint for future generations, even with safeguards.

It got me thinking about our own tech. We’re building increasingly complex systems, reliant on proprietary algorithms and black box processes. What happens when the original creators are gone? Do we risk losing the ability to maintain, adapt, or even *understand* the technology we've built? A modern Atlantis, built on sand. A slightly unsettling thought, isn't it?
