**The Great Pellet Grill Pickup Predicament**

So, I finally pulled the trigger on a Yoder YS640 pellet grill. The only thing standing between me and smoked brisket bliss was the $200 delivery fee. "No problem," I thought, "my trusty Nissan Xterra has never let me down." A quick search for the YS640's vehicle dimensions led to a full-blown living room investigation with a tape measure. It was going to be a perfect, money-saving fit. Sometimes, the best tech solution isn't an app or a drone; it's just knowing your own vehicle's cargo space and a willingness to Tetris a premium grill into the back.
