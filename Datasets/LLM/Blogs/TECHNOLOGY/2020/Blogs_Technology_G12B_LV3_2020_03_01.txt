## The Echo of Connection in a Digital Age

Remember when Baby Yoda first appeared in *The Mandalorian*? The internet *exploded*. Suddenly, everyone was obsessed with this tiny, green creature, and it wasn’t just about the cuteness. It was about this yearning for connection, for something pure and familiar in a world that felt increasingly fragmented. 

It got me thinking about our relationship with technology in 2020. We’re more connected than ever, yet so many of us feel isolated. Scrolling through feeds, liking posts… is it really *connection*? 

Like Rey and Kylo Ren’s complicated relationship in *Star Wars*, or the potential storyline of their descendants linked to Grogu, I wonder if we're overlooking something deeper. Perhaps true connection isn't about quantity, but about the quality of those moments, the shared experiences that forge lasting bonds, even if they’re virtual. Maybe it’s time to put down the phone and look up – truly see the people around us.
