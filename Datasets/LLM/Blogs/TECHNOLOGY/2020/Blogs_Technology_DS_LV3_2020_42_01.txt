Back in early 2020, as I redesigned my site, I wrestled with tracking visitor stats without invading privacy. The GDPR loomed large—how could I understand my audience while respecting their data? I dug into compliant practices, learning to mask IPs, generalize locations, and keep timestamps vague. It struck me: true insight doesn’t require prying. By prioritizing consent and minimal data, I built trust and still gleaned meaningful trends. In a digital age, balancing analytics with ethics isn’t just possible—it’s essential for genuine connection.
