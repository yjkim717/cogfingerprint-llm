"Lost in the Multiverse: Unpacking the Timeless Themes of Bioshock Infinite"

As I sat in front of my TV, controller in hand, finishing Bioshock Infinite in the spring of 2020, I couldn't help but feel a sense of existential dread wash over me. The world outside was chaotic - the pandemic was in full swing, and the news was filled with stories of lockdowns and uncertainty. But it was the game's ending that really got me thinking.

For those who haven't played Bioshock Infinite, the game follows Booker DeWitt, a private investigator who's tasked with retrieving a young woman named Elizabeth from the floating city of Columbia. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that there's more to Elizabeth and Columbia than meets the eye. The game's climax is a mind-bending exploration of the multiverse theory, and the fate of Booker and Elizabeth is left up to interpretation.

As I reflected on the game's ending, I started to think about the parallels between the multiverse theory and our own reality. In 2020, we're living in a world where technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate. We're constantly connected to our devices, and the lines between reality and virtual reality are becoming increasingly blurred. The idea that there are multiple versions of us living different lives in different universes doesn't seem as far-fetched as it once did.

The game's portrayal of the multiverse theory also made me think about the concept of choice and consequence. In the game, Booker's choices have a profound impact on the world around him, and the multiple endings are a testament to the complexity of decision-making. It's a theme that resonates deeply in today's world, where our individual choices - whether it's wearing a mask or downloading a certain app - have a ripple effect on those around us.

As I finished the game and shut off my console, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the way Bioshock Infinite had made me think about the world in a new way. It's a game that's often described as thought-provoking, but I think that's selling it short. It's a game that's willing to confront the complexities of the human experience head-on, and that's something that I think we can all learn from in 2020.

In a year that's been marked by uncertainty and chaos, Bioshock Infinite is a reminder that even in the most complex and confusing of times, there's always something to be learned from exploring the unknown. So, if you haven't already, take some time to dive into the world of Columbia and experience it for yourself. You never know what truths you might uncover.
