**The Ghost of Pixels Past**

There’s something strangely compelling about chasing a feeling, isn’t there? Lately, I’ve been obsessed with the idea of truly *recreating* the old school gaming experience. It started with a crazy thought: could hooking up RetroArch to my CRT TV via VGA somehow mimic the lag and warmth of playing on a genuine NES or SNES? 

I spent a weekend wrestling with adapters, battling input delay, and staring at a grainy, flickering screen. It wasn’t perfect, but there was a certain… something. A ghost of the past, maybe. It reminded me of the patience, the anticipation, the *feel* of those early games.  It’s a reminder that technology, even today, can still evoke powerful memories.
