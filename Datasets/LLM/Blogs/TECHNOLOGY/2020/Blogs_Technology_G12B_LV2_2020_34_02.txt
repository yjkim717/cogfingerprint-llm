## The Weight of Choice (and a Really Big Grill)

Okay, so I'm facing a dilemma. A *serious* dilemma involving a Yoder YS640 pellet grill. Sounds silly, right? But it’s actually a microcosm of so much these days. Do I ship it, paying extra for convenience? Or do I brave the pickup, wrestling with vehicle dimensions and hoping my SUV can handle the beast?

It's more than just a grill, though. It's about weighing options, a constant in 2020. Every purchase, every plan, feels like a calculation. Shipping feels like surrendering to the algorithm, while pickup feels…well, stubbornly independent. Maybe I’ll just stand here a little longer, pondering the possibilities. And the smoke. Definitely the smoke.
