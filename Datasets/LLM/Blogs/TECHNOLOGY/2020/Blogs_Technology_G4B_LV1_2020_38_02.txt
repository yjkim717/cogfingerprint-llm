**The Scroll and the Silence: My 2020 Career Doubt**

Okay, real talk. As a recent grad, staring at an inbox full of “associate” roles in publishing and journalism felt… intimidating. Everyone seemed to have this effortless string of internships under their belt, a glowing testament to their passion. And me? I had a few scattered, mostly online, and suddenly felt like I was starting a race with a really, *really* slow bike.

It’s weird, right? We’re living in 2020, a world saturated with digital connection. I spent hours scrolling through LinkedIn, seeing everyone’s curated career journeys. But the irony is, my “experience” felt incredibly…quiet. 

I started questioning if I was even competitive. Was a few online articles and a volunteer gig enough? Honestly, it’s a frustrating feeling – being utterly aware of the digital landscape, yet feeling like I was missing a crucial piece of the puzzle.  Maybe the value isn't always in the *quantity* of experience, but in how you use the tools available. Still figuring that one out.
