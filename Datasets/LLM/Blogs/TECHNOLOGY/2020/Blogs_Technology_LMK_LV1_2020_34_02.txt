"As I prepped for my backyard BBQ bonanza in 2020, I found myself pondering the logistics of hauling my new Yoder YS640 pellet grill home. The question on my mind: would it fit in my trusty 2012 Nissan Xterra? I checked with my local dealer, and they assured me the grill was a beast, but didn't specify the package size. Shipping cost was an option, but I wanted to avoid extra fees. After some digging, I discovered the YS640's compact packaging made it a perfect fit for my Xterra, saving me on shipping and sealing the deal on a stress-free grill pickup."
