**The Static in My Head – and the Zoom Calls**

It’s… a lot, isn’t it? 2020. Suddenly, everyone was glued to screens, and for me, it was like turning up the volume on the world tenfold. I’ve always had Asperger’s, and noise sensitivity is a *huge* part of it. But the constant Zoom calls, the notifications pinging, the background chatter – it was a relentless sensory overload. 

My family, bless their hearts, just didn't *get* it. They’d tell me to “just relax” or “tune it out,” which, as someone who processes sound differently, felt like a slap in the face. It really exacerbated the existing family conflict we were already navigating. 

I started using noise-canceling headphones constantly, creating a little bubble of calm. It helped, but it also felt isolating. I realized I needed to advocate for myself, to explain *why* the constant digital buzz was so overwhelming. It’s a battle, for sure, but finding my voice – even a quiet one – felt like a small victory.
