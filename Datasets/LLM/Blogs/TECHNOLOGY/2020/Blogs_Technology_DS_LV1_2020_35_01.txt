It’s 2020, and I’m spending more time than ever staring at screens. My phone buzzes—another notification, another curated update from a world on fire. I scroll, I click, I consume. It’s all so seamless, so… comforting.

But sometimes, in a quiet moment between Zoom calls, a thought slips through: what if all this tech is just an elaborate puppet show? We pull the strings, crafting perfect digital personas and filtering our realities into bite-sized, manageable pieces. We’re the masters, designing algorithms to feed us what we want to see.

Yet, we’re also the puppets—dancing to the chimes of pings and likes, our anxieties soothed by the endless scroll. It’s a brilliant, collective self-deception, shielding us from the raw uncertainty outside. But at what cost? The show must go on, but I can’t help wondering who’s really in control.
