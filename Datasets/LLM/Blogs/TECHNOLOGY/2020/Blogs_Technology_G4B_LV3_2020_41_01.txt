**The Weight of Tomorrow’s Weapons**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Looking at the headlines in 2020, you see so much talk about the future – the pandemic, the economy, even the next big tech release. But I’ve been thinking a lot lately about something less flashy: the weapons we’re building *today*. 

Reading about the Raytheon OCX project – this massive, delayed system – it felt like a stark reminder. Are we spending so much time and money chasing hypothetical threats that we’re missing the urgent needs right in front of us? 

It’s not about being anti-technology, of course. But shouldn’t there be more scrutiny, more oversight, especially when budgets are so enormous?  It makes you wonder if we're truly prioritizing what we *need* versus what we *might* need a decade down the line.  A little reflection feels crucial, doesn’t it?
