It’s 2020, and as a Canadian diving deeper into crypto, I’ve hit a familiar wall: moving beyond small buys. I wanted exchanges that link directly to my bank account—something secure, straightforward, and suited for larger moves. But navigating fees? That was another maze entirely. Some platforms lure you in with low trading costs, only to sneak in withdrawal charges that make you wince. It’s a balancing act between convenience and cost, trust and transparency. In this fast-paced digital finance world, finding the right fit isn’t just about the tech—it’s about feeling confident with every transaction.
