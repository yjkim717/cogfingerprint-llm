>## The Ghost of My First Laptop

Remember those chunky, beige laptops from the early 2000s? Mine was a relic, a beige behemoth I affectionately called "The Brick." I lugged it everywhere in 2008, writing angsty poetry and painstakingly crafting MySpace profiles. 

It feels strange now, looking at my sleek, featherlight machine. The speed! The battery life! It’s almost unbelievable how far we’ve come. But sometimes, I miss The Brick. It wasn’t just a computer; it was a portal to a different online world, a tangible piece of my awkward teenage years. It represents a simpler time, before constant connectivity and endless notifications, when the internet felt… quieter.  It's funny how technology evolves, and how much we carry our memories alongside it.
