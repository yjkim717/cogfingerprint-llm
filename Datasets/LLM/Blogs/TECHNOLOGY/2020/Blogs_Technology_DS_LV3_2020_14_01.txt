There’s something magical about firing up RetroArch on my old PC, connecting it via VGA to a CRT TV in 2020. As the scanlines flicker to life, I’m transported back—not just in pixels, but in feeling. The near-instant input response, the soft dithering in classic games—it’s more than nostalgia. It’s a quiet rebellion against today’s hyper-polished, lag-heavy gaming. In a world rushing forward, sometimes the purest joy is found by looking back.
