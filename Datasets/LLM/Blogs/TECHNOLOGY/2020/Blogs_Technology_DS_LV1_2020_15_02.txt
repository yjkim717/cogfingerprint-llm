It’s 2020, and I’m supposed to be mastering remote work tools, but I keep thinking about Skyrim. Everyone obsesses over the stealth archer—the safe, distant approach. But I’ve always preferred the melee archer: close, risky, and personal. Daggers and invisibility make stealth feel earned, not just convenient. Maybe that’s why I still rely on pen and paper for brainstorming, even with all these apps. Sometimes, the most direct path is the most satisfying.
