"Finding Time for Passion Projects in Lockdown 2020. As I sat in front of my screen, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me as I worked on my Xenogears Explained video series on YouTube. With 2020's lockdowns, my schedule had cleared of many commitments, but ironically, other projects filled the void. Still, I managed to squeeze in some gaming content, pouring my heart into explaining the intricacies of this cult classic. It's amazing how a little creativity can carve out space for the things that truly matter, even in the most chaotic of times."
