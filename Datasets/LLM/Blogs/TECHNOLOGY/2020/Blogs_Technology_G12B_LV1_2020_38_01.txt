## The Algorithm and the Edit: Finding My Place in a Digital World

It’s late 2020, and the world feels…different. We all know that, right? Between the pandemic and the constant churn of news, it’s been a year of adjusting. I’ve been doing a lot of adjusting myself, specifically when it comes to figuring out what I want to *do* with myself.

I just finished my English and Philosophy degree, which sounds wonderfully intellectual, but translates to a lot of “So, what are you going to *do* with that?” conversations. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a little lost in the noise. I've been obsessively scrolling through LinkedIn, staring at job postings for publishing internships – a dream, really – and comparing myself to everyone else’s carefully curated profiles. 

It's a strange feeling, isn’t it? Knowing you have skills – I’m a pretty decent writer, I’ve got a knack for spotting typos, and I can argue a point like nobody’s business – but feeling like an algorithm is deciding whether you're "good enough." These applications are just data points, feeding into some automated system that decides who gets a chance.

I had a really helpful conversation with a mentor recently who reminded me that the “perfect” resume is a myth. He helped me reframe things. Instead of obsessing over ticking every box, he suggested focusing on *showing* what I can do. We went through my drafts, pointed out areas where I could sharpen my voice, and even used a tool to check for subtle grammatical errors I’d missed. (Seriously, Grammarly is a lifesaver.)

It made me realize something important. Technology, for all its potential to feel impersonal and overwhelming, can actually be a powerful tool for connection and growth. It's not just about algorithms and automation; it’s about leveraging these tools to refine our skills, get feedback, and ultimately, tell our story more effectively. 

This year has taught me that navigating the future isn’t about being flawlessly optimized. It’s about being adaptable, embracing the learning process, and understanding that even a philosophy graduate can find their place in a world increasingly shaped by code. Now, back to proofreading this cover letter… wish me luck!
