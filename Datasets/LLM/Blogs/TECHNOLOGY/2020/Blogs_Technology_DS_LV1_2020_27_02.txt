Scrolling through my phone in 2020 felt like mainlining rage. Every notification brought fresh outrage: COVID stats, another video of police brutality, the ensuing political firestorms. My feed was a vortex of anger, and I was drowning in it. I realized my phone wasn't just a window to the world; it was a weapon pointed at my own mental health. I started muting keywords and setting app timers. It wasn't about ignoring the problems, but about managing my capacity to face them without burning out. A little digital distance became my most vital tool.
