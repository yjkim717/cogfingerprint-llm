As website owners in 2020, we're caught between understanding our audience and respecting their data privacy. To stay GDPR-compliant while still gathering valuable insights, consider alternatives like IP address masking. This way, you can collect anonymized data on browser types and timestamps without infringing on user rights. By doing so, you'll not only avoid potential fines but also build trust with your visitors. It's a delicate balance, but one that's crucial for maintaining a loyal online community while navigating the complexities of data privacy regulations.
