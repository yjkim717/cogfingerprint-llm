## The Year My Smart Home Feltâ€¦ Dumb

Remember 2020? Everything felt a little off, right? My smart home was no exception. I'd been so excited about automating lights and thermostats, the whole shebang. But suddenly, relying on Wi-Fi felt incredibly fragile. A brief outage meant my doors were locked, my heating was off, and I felt utterly helpless. It was a strange lesson in digital dependency. Maybe a little less "smart" and a little more reliable is exactly what we need sometimes. It certainly made me appreciate a good old-fashioned light switch again.
