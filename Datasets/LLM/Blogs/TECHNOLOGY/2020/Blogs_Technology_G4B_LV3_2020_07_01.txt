**The Weight of Every Cent**

Remember 2020? It felt like *every* dollar mattered. I was building my little online shop with Shopify, excited about the ease of it all. Then I hit a wall – no built-in multicurrency checkout. Suddenly, potential customers from Europe or Australia were bouncing right out of my cart because of those pesky exchange rates. 

It felt… frustrating. Like a tiny, invisible barrier.  I started to wonder if the convenience of Shopify was actually costing me sales.  The thought of switching back to WooCommerce, a bit clunkier, felt almost appealing.  It highlighted just how crucial seamless global experiences are becoming in e-commerce.
