## The Algorithm and My Aunt’s Shoulder

It’s 2020, and everything feels… mediated. We’re connecting through screens, ordering groceries through apps, even getting medical advice from chatbots. It’s incredible, truly. But lately, I’ve been feeling a little disconnected from *real* things.

It started with a simple conversation. My aunt, bless her heart, hurt her shoulder. Now, her normal reaction would be to call me, describe the pain, and I'd offer a sympathetic ear and maybe suggest some stretches. But this time, she’d already Googled it. She’d taken an online quiz, diagnosed herself with a rotator cuff injury, and was already ordering a special brace.

I wasn’t mad, just…pondering. Where did the human element go? The shared worry, the actual listening? The algorithm provided a solution, a quick fix, but it stripped away the comfort of connection. 

Maybe I’m being old-fashioned. Technology *is* amazing. But I think we need to be mindful of what we’re trading for convenience. A diagnosis from a screen is efficient, sure, but a hug and a listening ear? Those are still pretty vital too. And in a year that’s felt so isolating, those human connections feel more important than ever.
