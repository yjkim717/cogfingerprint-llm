### The Ghost in the Machine (and My Hand)

There’s a special kind of frustration that only 2020 can deliver. It’s not just the big, world-stopping stuff. It’s the small, personal tech gremlins that push you over the edge.

For me, it was my trusty Logitech mouse. On my old laptop, it was a flawless extension of my hand. But on my shiny new quarantine-workhorse PC, it developed a stutter—a random, infuriating lag right in the middle of a crucial click.

I felt betrayed. This wasn't some no-name gadget; this was my reliable sidekick! I spent an hour down a rabbit hole: driver updates, fresh batteries, USB port jiggling. The whole ritual. It felt symbolic, you know? Here I was, trying to control my little digital world when something as simple as a cursor had a mind of its own.

It was a tiny, silly reminder that perfection is a myth, especially in tech. Sometimes, the connection just glitches, and all you can do is sigh, restart, and hope it behaves. A fitting metaphor for the entire year, really.
