## Preserving Digital Echoes: Why I'm Suddenly Obsessed with Digital Timelines

It's 2020, and we're all living increasingly online lives. Think about it – fleeting tweets, disappearing Instagram stories, forum posts lost to server migrations. It's a bit unsettling, isn't it? So much of our digital existence feels… ephemeral.

Lately, I've been fascinated by the idea of actively curating these moments. I stumbled upon a project allowing users to build detailed "timelines" – essentially digital archives that weave together text, images, and links, documenting a specific narrative. It's a beautiful concept; a way to give weight and context to online experiences that would otherwise vanish. 

It got me thinking: are we losing a valuable record of our collective online journey? Maybe taking the time to build these little digital time capsules isn’t so silly after all. It feels like a small act of preservation in a world of constant change.
