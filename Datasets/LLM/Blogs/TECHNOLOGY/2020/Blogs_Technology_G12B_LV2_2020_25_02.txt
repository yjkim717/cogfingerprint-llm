## The Quiet Shift in Student Tech

Remember when bringing a laptop to school felt revolutionary? Now, it's just…expected. As a Google Admin, I've noticed a subtle shift. Lately, the questions aren't about *how* to connect, but *how to manage* those connections. We're spending more time setting boundaries – like disabling Android device syncing – ensuring a focused learning environment for students. It’s a reminder of how quickly technology evolves, and our role in guiding its use.
