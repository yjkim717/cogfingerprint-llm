Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions:

**Lost in the Grind: When “Progression” Just Feels…Empty**

Remember 2020? Everything felt a little frantic, right? I was spending way too much time staring at screens, chasing that little progress bar in some endless online game. It started with Old School RuneScape – Ironman mode, specifically – and quickly spiraled into a relentless cycle of grinding and questing. 

I was *supposed* to be enjoying the challenge, but honestly, it just felt…hollow. Like I was optimizing for optimization, instead of actually *playing*.  I’d tell myself, “Just one more dungeon,” or “Let’s finish this quest.” But the satisfaction was fleeting. 

It made me think about how we use technology – are we building towards something meaningful, or just endlessly chasing the next notification, the next level?  Maybe it’s time to step away from the screen and find a different kind of progress.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a version focused on a different aspect of the original summary?
