>## The Allure of the Ghost, and Why I Put Down the Bow

Remember when everyone was obsessed with invisibility in video games? I dove headfirst into a "stealth archer" build in that new RPG everyone was playing. The idea was brilliant: unseen, raining arrows from the shadows. It was *fun* for a while, all that silent precision. 

But lately, I've found myself increasingly drawn to the close-quarters. Trading the bow for a pair of daggers, charging in, getting my hands dirty. It's a shift, I know. Maybe it’s a reflection of how I feel about the world right now – a desire for more direct engagement after so much observing from a distance in 2020. Sometimes, you just want to *feel* the impact.
