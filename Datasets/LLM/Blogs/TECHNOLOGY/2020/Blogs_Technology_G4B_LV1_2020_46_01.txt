**Lost in the Forest of Trusts – SCOM and Child Domains**

Okay, so I was helping a colleague just a few months back, completely new to SCOM, and he was wrestling with monitoring in a child domain. It felt like he was lost in a digital forest! He’d set up a management group, which is great for centralizing things, but then realized he needed to ensure latency wasn’t killing his monitoring data. 

The key, we discovered, was understanding transitive trust. Basically, how the trust relationships between domains were impacting how SCOM could see everything. It’s a surprisingly complex topic, especially when you’re trying to get a clear picture of performance. 

We ended up tweaking a few settings, and suddenly, the dashboards started making sense. It really hammered home the importance of digging deeper than just the initial setup – especially when dealing with more complex environments.  Anyone else hit this wall?
