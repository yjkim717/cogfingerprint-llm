As I sat down to refactor some legacy C code in 2020, I stumbled upon a fascinating debate - the use of macros for variable declaration. It's a practice that's been around for ages, but is it still essential in modern C programming? I found myself torn between the convenience it offers and the concerns it raises about code readability. On one hand, macros can simplify variable declarations, making the code more concise. On the other hand, they can obscure the underlying logic, making it harder for others (or even ourselves) to understand the code. I'm curious to know - do you swear by macros for variable declaration, or do you prefer a more explicit approach? Are there better alternatives that strike a balance between brevity and clarity? As we continue to evolve as developers, it's worth revisiting such fundamental practices and gathering insights from the community to shape our coding habits.
