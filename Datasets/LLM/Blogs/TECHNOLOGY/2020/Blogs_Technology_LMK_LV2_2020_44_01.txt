As I navigated the Trading212 app in 2020, I found myself wondering: do I actually get dividends on my Rolls Royce shares? The thrill of investing can be exhilarating, but the technicalities can be overwhelming. I discovered that Trading212 does pay out dividends, and I was relieved to know my Rolls Royce shares would receive the dividend yield. It was a great feeling, knowing that my investments were working for me, even when I wasn't actively trading. For fellow investors, I hope my experience provides clarity on receiving dividends through Trading212.
