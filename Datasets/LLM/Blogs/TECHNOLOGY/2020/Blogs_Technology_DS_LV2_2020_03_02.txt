### The Unplanned Upgrade

Remember the Before Times? In early 2020, my relationship with tech was simple. My phone was for memes, my laptop for work. Then, the world shrank to the size of a screen.

Suddenly, that little camera lens wasn't just for selfies; it was a portal. It was how I saw my parents, celebrated birthdays in little Brady Bunch squares, and attended virtual happy hours that felt both awkward and essential. My phone became a tether to normalcy, and my laptop, my entire office.

I won't lie, it was exhausting. The constant pings, the "you're on mute" chorus. But in the quiet moments, I saw the real upgrade. I saw my grandmother master a video call, her face lighting up as we all waved from our separate boxes. Technology stopped being just a tool for convenience and became a bridge for our humanity. In a year of profound distance, it was the very thing that held us close. Funny how that works.
