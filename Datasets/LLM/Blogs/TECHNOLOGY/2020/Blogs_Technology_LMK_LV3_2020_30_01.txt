"As I sat down to refine my Statement of Purpose for a CS PhD in 2020, I realized that grad school is not just about coding skills, but about articulating my research vision. Crafting a compelling application requires introspection and clarity on how my goals align with the program. By distilling my motivations and aspirations, I hope to showcase my potential and make a strong case for my place in the CS community."
