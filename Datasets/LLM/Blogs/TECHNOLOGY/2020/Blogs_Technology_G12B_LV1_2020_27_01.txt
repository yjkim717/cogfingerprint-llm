>## The Algorithm and the Endless Scroll

It’s 2020, and I feel like I’ve been scrolling for years. Not just social media – though that’s a hefty chunk of it – but *everything*. News, forums, online courses, even recipe websites. It’s a relentless feed, a digital treadmill. 

I recently remembered Old School RuneScape, a game I played obsessively as a kid. There was a certain satisfying grind to it, a tangible sense of progress. You’d choose a skill – woodcutting, fishing, smithing – and *do it*. For hours. No algorithm suggesting something “better” to click on. Just you, a tree, and a very, very slow axe.

It got me thinking. Maybe we've lost something in this constant pursuit of novelty. This curated, personalized experience, while convenient, can be… exhausting. It’s like being perpetually offered the *perfect* distraction, and rarely pausing to actually *do* anything. 

Maybe I need a little less algorithmic grace and a little more… repetitive, deliberate action. Maybe I need to find my own digital tree to chop.



Hope this works for you!
