**Drowning in Alerts: My SCOM Rescue Mission**

It’s weird how quickly things can spiral, right? Back in 2020, our Exchange 2016 environment was a *mess*. We’d slapped together some SCOM monitoring, and suddenly we were buried under a tidal wave of alerts. Redundant, noisy, and frankly, driving everyone crazy. 

I remember staring at the SCOM console, feeling completely overwhelmed. It was like trying to find a single grain of sand on a beach. That’s when I realized we needed a serious overhaul. We started consolidating health sets, ruthlessly eliminating duplicates, and implementing overrides to silence the truly unimportant notifications. 

It wasn't magic, but it was a huge relief.  SCOM became a tool for *action*, not just a source of constant anxiety.  It really highlighted the importance of thoughtful monitoring—you build it, you own it!
