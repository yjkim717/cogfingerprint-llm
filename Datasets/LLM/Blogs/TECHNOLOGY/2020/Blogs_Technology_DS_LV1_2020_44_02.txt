### The Unseen Patient: Rethinking X-Ray Safety in the Dental Chair

Every day, dental professionals stand as silent guardians of our oral health. Yet, in their vital work of diagnosing hidden cavities and jaw issues with X-rays, they face a persistent, invisible risk: cumulative radiation exposure. While a single dental X-ray poses a minimal threat to a patient, the story is profoundly different for the hygienist or dentist who performs dozens of these procedures weekly, for years on end.

The focus often lands on the lead apron protecting the patient's torso, but what about the professional's thyroid? Situated in the neck, this delicate gland is highly sensitive to radiation. Emerging research continues to highlight a concerning link between chronic, low-dose radiation exposure and an increased risk of thyroid nodules and even thyroid cancer. For those in the heart of the operatory, this isn't a distant statistic; it's a potential occupational hazard.

It’s a sobering reminder that patient safety and clinician safety are two sides of the same coin. The commitment to health must extend to those providing the care, ensuring that the tools of diagnosis do not become sources of harm.

### My 2020 Time Capsule: A Year of Digital Everything

I remember the grand plans for 2020. A year of travel, of crowded concerts, of handshakes. Instead, my world shrank to the dimensions of a laptop screen. At first, it felt like a loss, a global pause button no one asked for. But then, something shifted.

My screen became a portal. I saw my newborn niece take her first wobbly steps via a pixelated video call from another continent. My book club, once confined to a local cafe, welcomed a member from Lisbon. I attended a friend’s “Zoom wedding,” crying happy tears into my webcam.

We weren't just “using technology”; we were leaning on it to preserve our humanity. It was clunky and sometimes frustrating, but it was also profound. 2020 taught me that connection isn't about physical proximity. It’s about the will to reach out, and the humble, miraculous tech that lets a simple “I’m here for you” bridge any distance.
