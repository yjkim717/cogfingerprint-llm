"I was beyond excited to pre-order Rivian's electric vehicle in 2020, but as the months went by, I found myself stuck in limbo. The lack of clear pricing information made it tough to plan my finances. I wasn't alone - many fellow enthusiasts were left wondering when we'd get the details we needed. As someone who's eager to join the electric revolution, I hope Rivian will soon share more transparent pricing, allowing us to make informed decisions about our next ride."
