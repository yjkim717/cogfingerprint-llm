Remember March 2020? My world shrank to these four walls, but my screen became a portal. I finally downloaded Zoom, fumbling through virtual birthdays and my grandma’s first video call. Her pixelated smile, a tiny beacon in the isolation. It was clunky and we’d talk over each other, but it was everything. That year, technology stopped being about the latest specs. It became our shared table, our lifeline, the quiet hero stitching our lives together when we were most apart.
