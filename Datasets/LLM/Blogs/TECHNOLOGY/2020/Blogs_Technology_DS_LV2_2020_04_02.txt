### The Glitch in the Machine: What a Video Game Taught Me About Our Digital Echo Chambers

It was late 2020, and I was deep in what I call a "pandemic replay"—dusting off old video games to fill the quiet, shapeless hours. I booted up *BioShock Infinite*, a game I hadn't touched since 2013. Back then, its ending—a mind-bending spiral of alternate realities, constants, and variables—felt like a brilliant piece of sci-fi fiction. Playing it now, in the thick of a year defined by isolation and algorithmic feeds, it didn’t feel like fiction anymore. It felt like a documentary.

The game’s core revelation is that a single choice—a man named Booker DeWitt accepting or refusing a baptism—shatters reality into two paths. In one, he remains the broken Booker. In the other, he is reborn as the fanatical Zachary Comstock. Two selves, born from one moment, existing in parallel worlds.

As my character, Booker, navigated this, the game’s AI companion, Elizabeth, had the power to open "tears" between these realities. She could see all the doors, all the possibilities. And sitting there in my living room, bathed in the blue glow of the screen, it hit me: **Our digital lives have become a low-resolution version of this.**

Think about it. In 2020, our realities are increasingly curated. Our baptism moment is that first "Like," that first follow, that first article we click on. From that single data point, an algorithm gets to work, building us our own personal Columbia in the cloud. It constructs a reality where our beliefs are constantly reinforced, our preferences catered to, and our outrage carefully metered out.

The "Booker" path might be my actual, messy self—the one who has doubts, who sees nuance, who changes his mind. But the "Comstock" path is the rigid, algorithmically-defined avatar of me. It's the version that is fed a steady stream of content confirming what I already think, slowly hardening my perspectives into unshakeable dogma. It creates a fanatic, not through conscious choice, but through a thousand passive consumptions.

And Elizabeth? She’s the potential we all have—but often neglect—to open a "tear" into another perspective. She represents the conscious, difficult effort to seek out information that challenges us, to listen to people we disagree with, to understand the "why" behind another person's reality. It’s so much easier to stay in our own sky-city, where the music is always our music and the voices are pleasant echoes of our own.

The powerful, haunting lesson of *BioShock Infinite* is that to break the cycle of violence and dogma, Elizabeth had to drown the source of the divergence. She had to collapse the possibilities back into one point to ensure a better, singular future.

We can’t drown the internet, nor should we want to. But we can break our own cycles. We can actively choose to be our own Elizabeth. It means intentionally following people who think differently. It means reading the whole article, not just the headline. It means seeking understanding before launching a rebuttal.
