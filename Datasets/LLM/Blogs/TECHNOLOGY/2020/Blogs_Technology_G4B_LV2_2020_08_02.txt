**The Static in My Head (and My Home)**

Okay, let’s be real – 2020 was… a lot. For me, it was a constant battle against a rising tide of sensory overload. You know, living with Asperger’s already makes the world feel a little too bright, a little too loud. But then, throw in a pandemic, everyone crammed into smaller spaces, and suddenly, it was like someone cranked up the volume on reality. 

My parents, bless their hearts, were trying to be supportive, but their everyday noises – the clatter of dishes, the endless TV chatter, even just *talking* – became this unbearable, vibrating static in my head. It felt like a physical pressure, building and building.

Ironically, we’d all been trying to find connection through technology. Zoom calls, endless scrolling, trying to bridge the gap of isolation. I’d retreat into my headphones, desperately seeking a little quiet, a little control.  A Spotify playlist became my refuge, a carefully curated wall of sound designed to block out… well, everything. 

It wasn't about rejecting connection; it was about survival.  It felt like a really basic need – a little space to just *be* – was being completely ignored.  Looking back, it highlights how crucial it is to understand and respect individual needs, especially when the world is already throwing everything it has at you.  Anyone else feel this way?
