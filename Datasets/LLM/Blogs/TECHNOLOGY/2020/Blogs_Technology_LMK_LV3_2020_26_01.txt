"As I scrolled through social media in 2020, I noticed Facebook and Instagram's 'on this day' feature throwing me back to past posts. It sparked a thought - why not have a similar feature in WordPress? Imagine being notified of old blog posts on the exact date they were published. As a blogger, this 'throwback' feature would be a great editor tool, allowing me to revisit and share past content, reigniting meaningful conversations."
