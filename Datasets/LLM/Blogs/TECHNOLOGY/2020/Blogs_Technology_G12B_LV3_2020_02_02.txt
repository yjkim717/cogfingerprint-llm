## My Retro Gaming Dreams and Android 11's Roadblock

Okay, so I’m officially feeling the frustration of tech updates. My Samsung Galaxy recently got the Android 11/One UI 3.0 treatment, and while it's slick, it's thrown a wrench in my retro gaming hobby. Suddenly, my emulators – Citra, Drastic, My Boy! – are struggling to find my ROMs stored on the SD card. 

Apparently, Android 11's "scoped storage" is making things tricky for developers. It's all about API targeting now, which is great for security, I guess, but leaves me longing for simpler times of carefree Game Boy Advance gaming. Anyone else facing this? Hoping a clever workaround emerges soon – my Pokémon Emerald save is *begging* to be continued!
