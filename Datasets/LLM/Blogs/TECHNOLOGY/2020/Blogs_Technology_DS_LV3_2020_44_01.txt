It’s 2020, and I’ve just downloaded Trading212, eager to dip my toes into investing. I bought a few Rolls Royce shares, drawn in by talk of dividends and that tempting yield. But now, I’m staring at the app, confused. Where are my dividends? Are they not paying them anymore, or is the platform holding out on me? It’s a strange new world, trusting a piece of technology with my money, and sometimes it feels like you’re just left guessing.
