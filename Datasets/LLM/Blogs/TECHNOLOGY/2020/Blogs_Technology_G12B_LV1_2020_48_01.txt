## The Waiting Game and the Phantom Price Tag

It's late 2020, and the world feels like it’s perpetually paused. For me, that pause is particularly acute when it comes to my Rivian. I put down a deposit ages ago, excited about the promise of electric adventure, and I’m still buzzing with anticipation. But here’s the thing: the closer the delivery date gets, the more anxiety creeps in.

It’s not the car itself. I *love* the design, the off-road capabilities, and the whole ethos. It’s the pricing. Small details keep shifting, options appear and disappear from the configurator, and a definitive, final price feels perpetually out of reach. How am I supposed to realistically plan for this? Budget for insurance, charging infrastructure, even just the initial road trip? 

It’s a strange feeling, wanting something so badly but being held back by a lack of clarity. It highlights a bigger trend, doesn't it? Tech promises so much, but often delivers a frustrating dance of shifting specs and elusive costs. I'm just hoping the Rivian arrives with a solid number attached, and a little less waiting.
