It’s funny how a simple Reddit post can make you pause and reflect. There I was, scrolling through hardware swap listings in 2020, and I stumbled on a Ryzen 5 1600AF paired with an MSI B450I board—lightly used, ready for a new home.

It reminded me of my own first build: the thrill of hunting for parts, the satisfaction of piecing it all together. That combo was a hidden gem back then, a budget powerhouse for so many of us diving into PC gaming or remote work setups during those long months at home. It wasn’t just hardware; it was a ticket to creativity, connection, and countless late nights. Funny how a motherboard and CPU can hold so many memories.
