"Building my 2020 gaming rig was a blast! For a smooth CS:GO experience, I opted for a mid-end PC with Ryzen 5 at its core. Paired with a decent GPU and 16GB RAM, it handled 1440p gaming with ease. If you're looking for a similar build, I'd be happy to share my component choices and why they worked so well for me."
