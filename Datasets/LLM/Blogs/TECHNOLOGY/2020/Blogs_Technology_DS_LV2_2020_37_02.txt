Remember when we thought 5G would instantly transform our lives in 2020? I was so eager, expecting lightning-fast downloads and seamless smart homes. The reality? A gradual shift. It’s a quiet evolution, not a revolution, reminding me that the most meaningful tech often integrates subtly into our daily rhythm, enhancing life without fanfare. It’s the steady upgrades, not the flashy promises, that truly connect us.
