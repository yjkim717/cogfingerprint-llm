As I waited for Rivian's updates in 2020, my excitement turned to frustration. The lack of transparency around their electrochromic roof and mid-range model made financial planning a challenge. I was eager to dive into the world of electric adventure, but without pricing details, I was stuck in limbo. It's 2020, and tech companies are revolutionizing the automotive industry, yet the absence of clear information is hindering my ability to make informed decisions. I'm not alone in this wait; many are left wondering when Rivian will share the details we need to take the leap.
