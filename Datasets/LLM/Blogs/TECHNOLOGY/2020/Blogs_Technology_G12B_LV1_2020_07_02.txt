>## The Unexpected Benefit of Automation

It's funny how solutions sometimes reveal themselves in unexpected ways. We launched our Shopify store last year, and almost immediately, our inbox flooded with “Where’s my discount code?” emails. It was a surprisingly large chunk of our customer service time! 

Then, a little digging led us to a clever automation: automatically applying a post-purchase discount for the next visit. The result? Not just fewer emails, but a noticeable uptick in repeat customers. It’s a reminder that technology isn’t always about flashy features; sometimes, the most impactful changes come from simply smoothing out the customer experience. Who knew a little automation could build loyalty?
