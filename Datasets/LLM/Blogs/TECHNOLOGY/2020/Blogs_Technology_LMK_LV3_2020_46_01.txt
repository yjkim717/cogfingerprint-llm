"Navigating SCOM Configuration for Child Domains: A 2020 Retrospective"

As I sat in front of my screen in 2020, sipping my coffee and staring at the SCOM configuration options, I felt like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Our organization had a child domain with a two-way transitive trust, and I was tasked with figuring out the best way to monitor it. Should I create a separate management group or rely on gateway servers? Both options had their pros and cons, and I was torn. I thought about the potential isolation and control a separate management group would offer, but also considered the added complexity and cost. On the other hand, using gateway servers seemed like a more streamlined approach, but would it compromise our monitoring capabilities? As I weighed my options, I realized that the right configuration would depend on our specific needs and infrastructure.
