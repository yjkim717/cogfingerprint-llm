It was 2020, and my new Yoder YS640 pellet grill felt like a beacon of normalcy. The question was how to get it home. My local dealer was a two-hour drive away. Could my trusty Nissan Xterra handle this technological marvel? I pictured the sceneâ€”strapping a premium grill into my SUV like a precious passenger. Paying for delivery was the safe bet, but the adventure of a pickup felt more fitting for the times. A small, personal quest for a piece of backyard tech felt like a tiny rebellion.
