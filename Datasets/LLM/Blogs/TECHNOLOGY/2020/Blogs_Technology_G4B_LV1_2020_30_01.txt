**The Year My SOP Shrinked (and My Tech Anxiety Grew)**

2020… honestly, it felt like a glitch in the matrix. I was wrestling with my PhD application, specifically my statement of purpose – a monstrous 1500 words! I hacked it down to 1000, obsessing over every syllable. 

But amidst the revisions, something shifted. I started noticing how reliant I was on Grammarly, ProWritingAid, and even just endless Google searches for phrasing. It was efficient, sure, but also… unsettling. Like outsourcing my voice. 

Suddenly, the digital tools I’d embraced felt like they were subtly shaping *me*. It was a weird, small realization amidst the bigger anxieties of the year, but one I’ve been pondering ever since.
