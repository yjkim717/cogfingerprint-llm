It’s 2020, and I’m staring at my screen, feeling the familiar sting of defeat. My USACO solution *should* work—I even simplified the reverse algorithm, trimmed every loop I could find. But there it is, frozen on test case 7, mocking me with that spinning wheel of doom.

I’ve always believed coding was about elegance, about clever logic. But here, brute force whispers temptingly, even though I know it’ll time out. It’s humbling. In a year when so much feels uncertain, these tiny digital battlegrounds remind me that some problems demand more than just intellect—they require patience, and sometimes, stepping away to breathe.

Maybe tomorrow, with fresh eyes, I’ll spot the inefficiency hiding in plain sight. For now, I’m learning that progress isn’t always linear—and that’s okay.
