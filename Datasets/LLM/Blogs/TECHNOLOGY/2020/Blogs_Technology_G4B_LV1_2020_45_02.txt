**Building Worlds, One Click at a Time**

Remember those weird browser games we used to obsess over back in 2020? I stumbled across one recently that really got me thinking. It was essentially a digital Lego set – you built your armies by snapping together “sockets” and “blueprints,” tweaking each “node” with a clever “node composer.” 

It felt oddly satisfying, like reverse-engineering a strategy.  It made me realize how much of our tech now is about assembling pre-built components. We’re building incredible things, but sometimes I miss the pure joy of starting with a blank slate and figuring it out yourself.  Anyone else feel that way?
