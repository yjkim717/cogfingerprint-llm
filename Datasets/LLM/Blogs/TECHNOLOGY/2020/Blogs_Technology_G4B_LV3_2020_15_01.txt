**Lost in the Monster’s Lair (and My Guidebooks)**

Remember 2020? The feeling of being utterly overwhelmed by *everything* was pretty universal. I felt it intensely when I finally took the plunge into *Monster Hunter World*. Gorgeous game, right? But those initial tutorials… they just vanished into the digital ether. I was drowning in information, desperately trying to master the monster hunts. 

It struck me – I needed a lifeline.  That’s when I realized the power of online gaming communities. Connecting with other players, learning together… it actually made the whole experience bearable, and frankly, a lot more fun.
