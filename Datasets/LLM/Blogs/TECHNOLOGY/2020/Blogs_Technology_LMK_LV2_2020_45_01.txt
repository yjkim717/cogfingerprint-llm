As a developer, I've often found myself drowning in the complexities of backend development. In 2020, I was thrilled to discover FatCoach, an experimental Backend as a Service (BaaS) framework that promised to simplify the process. Unlike GraphQL, which provides a query language for APIs, FatCoach takes a different approach, abstracting SQL databases for Front-End developers. This got me thinking - what if we could bridge the gap between frontend and backend development? FatCoach's innovative philosophy and architecture aim to do just that. By providing a seamless interface to interact with databases, it empowers frontend developers to take ownership of their data. As I explored FatCoach, built with Kotlin, I realized that this BaaS framework is more than just a tool - it's a catalyst for changing the way we build applications. It's an exciting time to be a developer, and I'm eager to see where FatCoach takes us.
