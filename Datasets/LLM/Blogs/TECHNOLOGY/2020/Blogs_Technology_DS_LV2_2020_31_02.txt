It’s 2020, and I’m knee-deep in a project with JavaScript files tangled like last year’s holiday lights. You know the feeling—trying to reuse a slick function across multiple pages without copy-pasting it everywhere. I decided to dive into modular imports, organizing dependencies like a digital Marie Kondo.

At first, it felt like learning to fold a fitted sheet: awkward and confusing. But once those imports clicked, everything just… flowed. Suddenly, my code wasn’t just functional—it was elegant. It’s funny how a little structure can turn chaos into clarity, making the whole development process feel less like work and more like crafting something meaningful.
