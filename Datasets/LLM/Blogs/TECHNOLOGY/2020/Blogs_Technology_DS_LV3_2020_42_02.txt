Looking back to 2020, when the world slowed down, my partner and I turned to technology in our quiet quest to conceive. We researched home insemination kits online, wondering if they were a legitimate path to avoid the clinical maze of IUI and IVF. In those isolated months, our screens became both a beacon of hope and a source of doubt, as we weighed simpler dreams against complex medical realities. It was a deeply personal journey, illuminated and complicated by the digital age.
