**The Ghosts in the App**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… mediated. We were all staring at screens, trying to connect through pixels. I was obsessing over dividend yields, specifically for Rolls Royce – a bizarre, almost ritualistic check on a company I barely understood, all thanks to Trading212. 

It felt like I was chasing ghosts, discrepancies popping up in the app, hinting at a world of finance just out of reach.  It wasn’t about the money, really, but the *feeling* of trying to grasp something tangible in a time of such pervasive uncertainty.  That little digital window into investment felt both incredibly powerful and strangely isolating.  A reminder that even with all the technology, some things still feel… elusive.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different version with a slightly different focus?
