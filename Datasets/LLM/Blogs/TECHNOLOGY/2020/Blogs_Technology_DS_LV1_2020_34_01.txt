The 3:00 AM glow of the nightlight is my new normal. My 3.5-year-old, who used to be a champion sleeper, has declared a personal war on bedtime. We do everything "right"—the same bath, the same three books, the same song. But the moment the light goes out, the negotiations begin. "I'm thirsty." "I need another hug." "There's a monster in the closet."

And naps? Forget it. She’s on a permanent nap strike, which means by 5 PM, she’s a tiny, overtired tyrant, and I’m a hollowed-out version of myself, running on cold coffee and sheer willpower. I know this is a phase, I’ve read all the articles, but in the deep silence of another failed night, it’s hard to remember that. This isn't just about sleep; it's a test of endurance, and my reserves are running dangerously low.

And here is a reflective blog post with a conversational tone, set in 2020.

### The Unlikely Gift of a Slower Scroll

Remember life before 2020? My phone was an extension of my arm, a constant stream of notifications, updates, and curated perfection. I was always "on," but never really present.

Then, the world paused. Stuck at home, my frantic scrolling began to feel hollow. The highlight reels of distant acquaintances lost their appeal. Out of sheer boredom, I started using my phone differently. I joined a local community group organizing grocery runs for elderly neighbors. I had long, meandering video calls with my parents, learning how to bake their famous bread.

In a year defined by technology's omnipresence, I found its true value. It wasn't in the noise, but in the quiet connections. My phone stopped being a window to a world I was missing and became a tool to nurture the one right in front of me. It took a global standstill to teach me how to be still, and for that, I'm weirdly grateful.
