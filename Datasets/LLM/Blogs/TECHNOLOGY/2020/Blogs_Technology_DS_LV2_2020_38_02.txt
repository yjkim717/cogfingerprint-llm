### The Unexpected Internship

In March 2020, my carefully planned career path evaporated. Conferences were canceled, offices shuttered, and the "competitive job market" everyone warned me about seemed to have slammed its doors shut. My fancy internship experience suddenly felt irrelevant in a world that had gone remote overnight.

My unexpected savior? A little app called Zoom, and the entire ecosystem of technology that bloomed around it. My new internship was in digital connection. I learned to build rapport through a shaky webcam, to collaborate asynchronously on Slack with people I’d never met in person, and to find community in niche online forums.

It was messy and far from the glossy office life I’d imagined. But it taught me a crucial lesson about resilience. The tech wasn't just a tool; it was the new venue. By embracing the awkwardness and leaning into the digital space, I didn't just survive a career transition—I discovered a more flexible, authentic way to build one. Sometimes, the most valuable opportunities aren't the ones you plan for, but the ones you adapt to.
