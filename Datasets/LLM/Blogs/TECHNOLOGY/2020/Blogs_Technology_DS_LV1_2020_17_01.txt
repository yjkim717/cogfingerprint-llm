It’s 2020, and I’m eyeing the Galaxy Tab S7+ as my digital notebook savior. The promise of scribbling notes directly onto PDFs feels like a dream—no more printing and highlighting!

Cross-platform access isn’t just a convenience; it’s a lifeline in this scattered work-from-home era. I want my ideas to flow freely, not get trapped in a single device. So, before I take the plunge, I’m asking: can this sleek tablet truly keep up with my on-the-go life?
