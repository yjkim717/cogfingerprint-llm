"Stuck in a Time Loop: My USACO Optimization Journey. In 2020, I dove headfirst into competitive coding, tackling USACO problems with gusto. But one challenge left me stumped - my solution was correct, yet timed out due to performance issues. As I wrestled with optimization, I learned that tweaking algorithms is as much an art as it is a science. Through trial and error, I discovered that refining my code wasn't just about speed; it was about clarity and efficiency. The journey taught me that sometimes, slowing down to optimize can make all the difference."
