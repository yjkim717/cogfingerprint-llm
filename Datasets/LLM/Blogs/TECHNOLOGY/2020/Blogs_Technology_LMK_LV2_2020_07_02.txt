"As an online store owner in 2020, I was frustrated when customers would leave my Shopify checkout without applying their discount code. I realized I needed a solution to automatically apply discounts after purchase. After some trial and error, I discovered remarketing strategies that helped. Now, I can ensure customers receive their discounts, even if they forget during checkout. It's been a game-changer for my business."
