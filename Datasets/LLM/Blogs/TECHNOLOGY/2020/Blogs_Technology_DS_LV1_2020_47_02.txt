It was supposed to be a simple upgrade. In the middle of 2020, with the world locked down, my new computer was my portal to everything—work, friends, even my sanity. But my trusty wireless Logitech mouse, a flawless performer on my old laptop, had developed a nervous twitch.

It would glide smoothly, then suddenly freeze for a split-second, like it was buffering. I did everything right: I downloaded the latest drivers, checked my computer’s performance stats, and even swapped out the mouse pad. Yet, the random USB lag persisted. It was a tiny, digital stutter, but in the middle of a crucial video call or a tight deadline, it felt monumental.

It made me reflect on how our relationship with technology is built on a foundation of assumed seamlessness. When that invisible contract breaks, even in the smallest way, it pulls us out of the digital illusion and reminds us that these are just machines, beautifully complex and sometimes, beautifully flawed. I wasn't just troubleshooting a mouse; I was patching a hole in my new reality.
