"Wireless Woes: Uncovering the Source of My Logitech Mouse Lag

As I settled into my new computer setup in early 2020, I was excited to dive into my work with my trusty Logitech wireless mouse. But, to my frustration, I started experiencing annoying lag issues. I thought it was just a one-off problem, so I swapped it out for another Logitech mouse, but the issue persisted. I tried troubleshooting - changing the USB receiver port, restarting my computer, and even updating my mouse drivers. Still, the lag remained. I was stumped. Was it a problem with my new computer or the Logitech mouse itself? After some digging, I discovered that the issue was related to interference from other USB devices. By switching to a different USB port and updating my drivers, I was finally able to resolve the issue. A simple solution, but one that took some trial and error to uncover."
