It’s 2020, and I’m staring at my Office 365 admin panel, baffled. I have all the right permissions, Teams and Stream centers open, but the "Create Live Event" button is just… gone. Is Microsoft phasing it out, or is this another pandemic-era delay? It’s moments like these that remind me: even with all our advanced tools, technology still keeps us guessing. A humbling lesson in patience and troubleshooting.
