**Lost in the Gears: My Unexpected Xenogears Obsession**

Okay, confession time. 2020 was… weird, right? I was desperately trying to figure out a way to make *something* happen, a little side hustle to keep me sane. That’s how I stumbled into ‘Xenogears Explained’ on YouTube. It started as a silly thought – a deep dive into this incredible, sprawling RPG. 

Now, I’m actually building a series! It’s completely part-time, fueled by late-night coffee and a genuine fascination. There’s something incredibly satisfying about taking a complex story and breaking it down, sharing it with others. 

Honestly, it’s a bit daunting. Content creation feels like a whole new world. But the feedback I've gotten so far has been amazing.  It’s a reminder that even small, passionate projects can be worthwhile.  Anyone else chasing a creative spark in 2020?
