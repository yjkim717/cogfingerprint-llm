As a developer, I've often found myself caught between the flexibility of front-end development and the rigidity of back-end infrastructure. In 2020, I discovered FatCoach, an experimental BaaS framework that's been a game-changer. By abstracting SQL databases, it empowers front-end developers to take control of data querying, liberating us from the constraints of traditional back-end architecture. What caught my attention was its query language, which offers more flexibility than GraphQL. I've been using Kotlin to integrate FatCoach into my projects, and the results have been impressive. The ease of use and adaptability have streamlined my workflow, allowing me to focus on creating seamless user experiences. FatCoach has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach back-end development, and I'm excited to see where this technology takes us. By bridging the gap between front-end and back-end, we're opening doors to new possibilities in software development.
