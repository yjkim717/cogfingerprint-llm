The Destiny 2 Community: A Cycle of Expectation and Disappointment

As I scrolled through social media in 2020, I couldn't help but notice the mixed emotions surrounding Destiny 2, Bungie's popular first-person shooter. The community was abuzz with complaints about the game's rewards system, with many players feeling that the drops were unfair and unbalanced. But as I dug deeper, I realized that the community was also guilty of hyping up certain outcomes and expecting Bungie to deliver.

It's a classic case of having your cake and eating it too. On one hand, the community clamors for new content and exciting rewards, but when Bungie tries to deliver, they're criticized for not meeting expectations. It's as if the community is perpetually stuck in a cycle of expectation and disappointment.

I've been guilty of it too - getting caught up in the hype surrounding a new season or update, only to feel let down when it doesn't quite live up to my expectations. But as I stepped back and reflected on my own behavior, I realized that I'm not just a passive player - I'm an active participant in shaping the community's expectations.

So, what's the takeaway? Perhaps it's time for the community to take a step back and acknowledge its own role in shaping the Destiny 2 experience. By being more mindful of our expectations and more open to change, we can work together with Bungie to create a more positive and rewarding gaming experience. After all, we're all in this together - players, developers, and community alike.
