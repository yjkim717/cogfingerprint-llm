Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a reflective and relatable tone around technology, set in 2020:

## The Glow of the Screen & The Weight of It All

Remember early 2020? Everything felt… surreal. We were all glued to our screens, connecting, consuming, *existing* mostly online. I bought noise-canceling headphones, convinced they'd bring peace. Instead, they amplified the constant hum of notifications, the endless scroll. 

Lately, I've been feeling this strange pull to just… unplug. Like my eyes are tired, my brain even more so. It's not about hating tech, it’s realizing that all this connection comes with a weight. A quiet longing for just a little less glow. Anyone else feeling this?
