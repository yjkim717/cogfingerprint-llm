As I scrolled through my Steam sale wishlist in 2020, Monster Hunter World caught my eye. I'd heard whispers of its challenging gameplay, reminiscent of the Souls-like series that Dark Souls fans adore. The thought of diving in solo intimidated me, so I decided to wait for online friends to join me. Playing with others would not only ease me into the world but also make the experience more enjoyable. With the sale price too good to resist, I took the plunge - and was excited to tackle the hunt with my gaming crew.
