## The Infinite Scroll and the Weight of Everything

Remember 2020? It feels like a lifetime ago, and yet, the echoes linger. For me, a big part of it was the sheer *volume* of… everything. The news, the pandemic, the racial injustice – it was relentless. And I realized I was contributing to it, scrolling endlessly through my phone, absorbing it all.

My relationship with technology shifted. It wasn’t just a tool for connection anymore; it felt like a conveyor belt of anxiety. Every notification, every headline, pulled me further into a cycle of frustration. I started noticing how much mental space I was giving to things I couldn’t control. 

Now, I'm trying to be more intentional. Less scrolling, more *being*. It’s a small thing, but disconnecting, even for a little while, feels like a tiny act of rebellion against the overwhelm. Anyone else feeling this?
