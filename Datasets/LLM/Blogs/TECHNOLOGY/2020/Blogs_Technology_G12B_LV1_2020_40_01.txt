## The Glitch in the System (and My Patience)

It’s 2020, and we’re all so reliant on digital rewards, aren’t we? I've been sinking way too many hours into GTA V lately, chasing those elusive online goals. So, when a promised $1 million bonus – a little digital pat on the back for consistent play – didn’t materialize after 72 hours, I felt… surprisingly frustrated. 

It's silly, I know. It’s just pixels. But it’s a small window into how much we've outsourced our validation to algorithms. A reminder that even in a sprawling virtual world, the system can glitch, and sometimes, you just have to wait (and maybe tweet about it).
