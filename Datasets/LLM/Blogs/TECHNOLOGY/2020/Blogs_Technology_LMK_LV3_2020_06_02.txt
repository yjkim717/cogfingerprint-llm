As I sat down to work on my 'Xenogears Explained' video series in early 2020, I was reminded that passion projects can be both a labor of love and a challenge. Amidst a busy schedule, I poured my heart into breaking down the complexities of this cult classic game for the gaming community on YouTube. The process was therapeutic, allowing me to connect with like-minded fans and share our collective enthusiasm. I'm excited to share my work and hear feedback from the community - it's a testament to the power of technology in bringing people together and fostering creativity.
