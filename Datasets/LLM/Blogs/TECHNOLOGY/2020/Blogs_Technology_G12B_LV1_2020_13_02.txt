## The Subscription Cliff and the Quest for Freedom

It's 2020, and the relentless hum of subscription services has become the soundtrack to our digital lives. Lately, I've been staring down the barrel of an expiring Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, a familiar feeling tinged with a growing unease. It got me thinking: am I truly *owning* my work, or just renting it?

I started poking around, researching alternatives like Scribus. The idea of exporting my InDesign projects—years of carefully crafted layouts—into an open-source format felt surprisingly liberating. It's a small act, maybe, but a quiet rebellion against the constant churn of recurring fees. A digital escape hatch, just in case. It makes you wonder what else we're unknowingly locking ourselves into.
