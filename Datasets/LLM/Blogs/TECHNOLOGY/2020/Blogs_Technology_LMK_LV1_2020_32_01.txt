**When Exchange Server Went Dark: A Troubleshooting Tale**

I'll never forget the morning of February 20, 2020, when our Exchange server suddenly stopped delivering emails. Panic mode activated. As the company's go-to IT person, I sprang into action to diagnose the issue. The error message was cryptic: "DNS query failed." Not exactly the most helpful clue.

After some frantic searching online, I discovered that our Exchange server was having trouble resolving the recipient's domain name. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) delivery was grinding to a halt. It seemed that the DNS query was timing out, preventing our server from sending emails.

A closer look at the server settings revealed that it was attempting to perform IPv6 DNS queries, which were not being resolved by our DNS server. I recall scratching my head, wondering why this was happening out of the blue. Hadn't we changed anything recently? After some digging, I realized that our server was configured to obtain DNS server addresses automatically, which can sometimes lead to issues.

The fix was surprisingly straightforward. I manually specified the DNS server IP addresses in the Exchange server settings, and voil√†! The emails started flowing again. However, I wasn't quite done yet. To ensure that the changes took hold, I restarted the Microsoft Exchange Transport service, which is responsible for handling SMTP delivery.

With the transport services restarted, our Exchange server was back up and running smoothly. It was a huge relief, let me tell you. The experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of monitoring our server settings and being prepared for unexpected issues.

As I reflected on the ordeal, I realized that troubleshooting is an art that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to learn. In the world of IT, problems can arise at any moment, and being able to diagnose and fix them quickly is crucial. The Exchange server debacle was a valuable learning experience, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share it with you. If you're facing similar issues, I hope this tale helps you resolve your own DNS query woes.
