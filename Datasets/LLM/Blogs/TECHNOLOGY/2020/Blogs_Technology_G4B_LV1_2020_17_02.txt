**Is Your Server Feeling Lonely? (And Vulnerable?)**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Being a sysadmin in 2020 feels like constantly playing catch-up. I was wrestling with a standalone Windows Server 2019 last week – basically, a little island of services I needed to keep humming.  My colleague was practically begging for advice on how to lock it down. 

He’s right to be concerned. Remote Desktop is fantastic for accessibility, but it's a massive attack vector if you’re not careful. We went through a deep dive, focusing on forcing strong passwords (seriously, no more ‘password123’!), and I even set up SFTP for file transfers – a much safer alternative to just dragging and dropping. 

Adding Let’s Encrypt for HTTPS was the final piece of the puzzle. Suddenly, even basic access felt more secure. It really hammered home the point: security isn’t just a checkbox; it’s a continuous conversation with your systems.  Anyone else spending too much time patching and protecting their digital castles?
