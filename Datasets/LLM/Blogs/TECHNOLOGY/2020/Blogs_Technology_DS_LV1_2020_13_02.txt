It’s 2020, and I’m staring at my expiring Adobe Creative Cloud subscription with a mix of dread and defiance. All those late nights perfecting layouts in InDesign—what happens to them now? I started digging: export to PDF, maybe try Scribus for open-source design, save reusable templates. It felt like packing a digital go-bag, preparing for life after the subscription model. In a year of so much uncertainty, taking back control of my files was one small, satisfying act of independence.
