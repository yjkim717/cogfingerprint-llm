## The Algorithm and the Obsession: Why I'm Still Diving Deep into Xenogears

It's 2020, and we’re all swimming in a sea of algorithms. TikTok dances, curated Instagram feeds… it’s easy to feel like content is just being *pushed* at us, devoid of genuine passion. Lately, I've been trying to fight that feeling. 

That’s why I’ve thrown myself headfirst into a project I’m ridiculously excited about: a series of videos explaining the complex narrative of *Xenogears*, a classic PS1 RPG. It’s a rabbit hole of philosophy, religion, and incredible storytelling. 

Honestly, it’s a little absurd. Who even *watches* this kind of deep dive anymore? But the process of dissecting it, sharing my thoughts, and connecting with a small community of fellow fans… that's genuinely rewarding. It's a reminder that technology doesn't *have* to be about fleeting trends. It can be a tool to explore the things we truly love.
