"As I dove into the world of browser-based games in 2020, I found myself drawn to the strategic depth of games like OGame. But what really sparked my curiosity was the idea of taking customization to the next level - allowing players to craft their own units from modular components. Imagine being able to mix and match different parts to create a unique spaceship or robot, tailored to your playstyle. 

I began brainstorming ways to make this a reality, and my mind landed on the concept of node composers and graphs. By representing different components as nodes, and defining how they interact with each other, I envisioned a system that could generate an almost endless variety of customizable units. The possibilities for game mechanics were exciting - from balancing resource costs to exploring emergent behaviors. As I continued to explore this idea, I realized that the true potential lay not just in the technology, but in the creative freedom it could offer players."
