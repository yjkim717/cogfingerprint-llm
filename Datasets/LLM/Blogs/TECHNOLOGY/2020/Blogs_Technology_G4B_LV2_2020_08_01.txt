**The Static and the Silence**

It’s weird, right? Back in 2020, everyone was glued to their phones – scrolling, liking, *living* online. I was too. Then, after a big shift, suddenly, all that noise felt… overwhelming. Like a constant static. 

I started noticing it with fragrances, too. Perfumes, once something I loved, now just felt jarring, artificial. It was like my senses were recalibrating, seeking something quieter.  Maybe recovery is just a giant reset button, forcing us to notice what we’ve been missing – the simple beauty of silence, and the scent of fresh air.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a completely different post based on a different prompt?
