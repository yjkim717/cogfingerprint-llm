**The Future Feels… Complex**

Remember when tech was supposed to *simplify* life? Back in 2020, I was still wrestling with the idea of a fully integrated digital world. Now, staring at the possibilities – like the Rivian R1T’s complicated infotainment system and those tantalizing autonomous features – it feels… more complex. 

I spent hours reading forums, just like that Rivian fan, obsessing over the UI, wondering about seamless connectivity, and secretly dreaming of a bed extender for my own truck. It’s not about rejecting the progress, it’s about recognizing that as technology advances, so does our need to understand it, adapt to it, and maybe, just maybe, hold onto a little bit of analog in the process.  What do *you* think? Is the future exciting, or a little overwhelming?
