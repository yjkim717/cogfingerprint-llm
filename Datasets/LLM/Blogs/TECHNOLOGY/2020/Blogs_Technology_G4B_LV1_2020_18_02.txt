**The Drive to Connect – A 2020 Reflection**

It’s funny how a seemingly simple login script can suddenly feel monumentally important. Back in 2020, I was wrestling with one just like this – a sysadmin’s nightmare in a 2012 R2 domain. The task? Ensuring each user automatically had the correct network drives mapped based on their office location. 

Honestly, it felt a bit like digital archaeology. Digging through Active Directory, tracing permissions, and battling stubborn mapping issues. It really hammered home the quiet, constant work of keeping things *connected*.  We take it for granted, these automated processes. But when they break, it throws a wrench into everyone's workflow. It’s a reminder that technology, at its best, is about seamless access – a drive to connect us all.
