**The Digital Litter Box Blues**

Remember 2020? We were all glued to screens, right? I was too – desperately trying to keep my sanity (and my work) afloat. But my new kitten, Leo, started exhibiting a frustrating habit: pooping *everywhere* but his little litter box. It felt like a digital distraction – I’d be focused on a Zoom meeting, and *poof*, a little surprise. 

It mirrored something bigger, honestly.  Sometimes, technology promises connection, but it can feel like a messy, unpredictable challenge, demanding constant attention and a whole lot of patience.  Just like training a cat, I guess!
