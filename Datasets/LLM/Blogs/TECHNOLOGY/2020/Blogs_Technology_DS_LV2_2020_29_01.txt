### The Day My Code Broke the Rules (And It Was Okay)

I remember the first time I truly wrestled with a macro. It was 2020, and the world outside felt like it was running on a broken, unpredictable script. Inside, I was seeking solace in the clean, predictable logic of code. I was building a nifty little helper for a project, a macro that was supposed to make everything neater.

But it refused to see a variable I’d defined right above it. It was like I’d handed a note to a friend in a soundproof box—they knew it was there but couldn't read a single word. That’s macro hygiene for you; it’s designed to keep things safe, to prevent your clever shortcuts from accidentally trampling over other parts of your program.

For days, I played by the rules, restructuring my code, trying to find a "proper" solution. And then, out of sheer frustration, I did it. I used the language’s escape hatch—the syntax that lets you break that hygiene, to reach through the glass and tap that outer variable on the shoulder.

The code worked. Instantly.

It felt like a tiny rebellion. In a year where so much felt out of our control, this was a deliberate, calculated choice to bend the rules for a greater good. It wasn't about being messy; it was about understanding the system so deeply that you knew when a little controlled chaos was the most elegant solution.

That moment stuck with me. It’s a reminder that the tools we use, from programming languages to video conferencing apps, are not just rigid sets of commands. They are landscapes to be explored, with hidden paths and secret levers. Sometimes, true mastery isn't just about following the rules, but about knowing—precisely and responsibly—when to gently, knowingly, break them.
