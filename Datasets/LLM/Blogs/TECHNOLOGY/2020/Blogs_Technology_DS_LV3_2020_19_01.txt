It’s 2020, and I’m thinking about the Atlanteans—not the mythical people, but the ancient builders of advanced tech. They left this massive database, filled with schematics and secrets, like a cosmic blueprint for humanity. But here’s the catch: they didn’t include how to build ZPMs, their ultimate power sources. It’s like inheriting a smartphone without the charger.

We’re scrambling to unlock their knowledge, but without that core energy, we’re stuck. It reminds me of our own tech today—so much data, but missing the heart to power real change. Maybe the lesson isn’t just in what they left behind, but in what they held back.
