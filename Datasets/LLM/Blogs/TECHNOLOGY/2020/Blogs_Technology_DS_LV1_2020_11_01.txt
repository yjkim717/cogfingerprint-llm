Remember those chaotic 2020 lockdowns? My friends and I retreated into our old Minecraft server, a digital time capsule. Weâ€™d built so much, but it was all scattered and forgotten. Then we found a tool that let us finally archive our prized gear and map art. It hit me then: in a year of disconnection, this wasn't just organizing blocks. It was a collaborative act of preserving our shared history, a small, defiant act of building something permanent together.
