Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a 2020 context:

**The Future Feels… Complicated**

Remember when “tech” felt like something separate from our lives? Like a gadget you bought, then mostly forgot about? I’m starting to feel like that’s changing, especially looking at vehicles like the Rivian R1T. 

I was reading about it recently – this electric truck – and honestly, I’m fascinated by how much *thinking* is going into the tech inside. It’s not just about horsepower; it’s about the whole experience. The blog post was buzzing about the infotainment system, how easy (or not!) it is to connect, and the crazy idea of letting third-party developers build apps for it. 

It’s a little unsettling, isn’t it? We’re building these incredibly complex machines, and we’re simultaneously handing them over to algorithms and external developers. It feels like we’re trading control for convenience, and I’m not entirely sure that’s a good deal.  2020 feels like the cusp of a shift, and I'm trying to figure out where we’re headed.  Anyone else feeling this way?

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
