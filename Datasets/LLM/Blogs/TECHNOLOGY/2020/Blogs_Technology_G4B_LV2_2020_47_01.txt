**The Little Things That Keep Me Up at Night**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2020, with everyone glued to screens, I started obsessing over grout. Seriously. A new homeowner, just like me, was emailing about loose tiles and worried water was seeping in. It made me think about the small, often unseen, issues in our lives – the things that *could* cause a bigger problem down the road. 

Like, how do we build resilience into our routines, our relationships, and our digital lives? Are we really prepared for the glitches, the unexpected updates?  It’s a reminder to focus on the foundations, you know?  Maybe it’s time to tackle that neglected grout, and maybe it’s time to build a stronger online presence too.
