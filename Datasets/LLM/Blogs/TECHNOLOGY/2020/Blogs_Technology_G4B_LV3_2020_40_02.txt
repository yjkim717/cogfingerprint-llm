**The Weight of the Pixelated Promise**

Remember 2020? We were all staring at screens, hoping for… something. For gaming, for connection, for a little escape. And in Destiny 2, that feeling was *intense*. Bungie built up these massive, breathtaking reveals, and the community, myself included, just… expected perfection. 

It’s a weird thing, isn’t it? We build up these towering expectations for digital worlds, for the next big thing. And when it inevitably falls short – when a launch isn’t flawless, or a season doesn’t deliver exactly what we dreamed of – there’s this wave of disappointment. 

I think part of it is us, though. We *want* to be amazed. But maybe, just maybe, we also need to remember that even the most brilliant creators are human. And sometimes, the best stories are the ones that surprise us, not the ones we perfectly predicted.
