>## The Endless Verification Loop

It's 2020, and you'd think verifying your identity online would be a breeze, right? Wrong. I’m currently wrestling with FACEIT, a popular platform for competitive gaming, and their phone verification system is proving to be a monumental headache. I've restarted my phone, toggled airplane mode on and off more times than I care to admit, and double-checked every digit. Still, nothing. 

It’s oddly frustrating, isn't it? Being held hostage by a digital gatekeeper demanding proof of existence. Makes you wonder how much of our online lives are truly *ours* when we're constantly bending to the whims of algorithms and security protocols. Just hoping I can get back to smashing some pixels soon!
