As web development projects grew more complex in 2020, I found myself drowning in a sea of JavaScript code. To stay afloat, I turned to modularization - breaking down my code into smaller, manageable files. By importing multiple JS files into a single, page-specific file, I simplified my code organization and streamlined my workflow. This shift not only boosted my productivity but also made it easier to maintain and update my code. It was a small change that made a big impact on my development process.
