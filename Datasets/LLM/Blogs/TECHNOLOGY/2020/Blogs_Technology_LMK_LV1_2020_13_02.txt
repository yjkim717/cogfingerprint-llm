As Adobe CC subscription renewal loomed in 2020, I faced a dilemma: continue paying or risk being locked out of my own files. I'd invested countless hours in InDesign templates and documents, but the thought of losing access was daunting. I began exploring alternatives like Scribus, wondering if I could export my files to a more open format. Converting template files proved tricky, but I was determined to break free from the Adobe ecosystem. It was time to take control of my creative work and find a more sustainable solution.
