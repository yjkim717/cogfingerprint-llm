It’s funny how priorities shift. Back in early 2020, I was so excited to build a new streaming rig, carefully picking out this Ryzen 5 1600AF and MSI B450I motherboard. It was going to be my creative engine.

But then, grad school applications happened. Suddenly, those fees felt like a mountain. My shiny new PC parts, still barely used, sat in their boxes. I realized the dream of streaming could wait; investing in my education couldn't.

So, here I am, listing them on Hardware Swap. It’s a little bittersweet, but it feels right. Sometimes the most powerful upgrade isn't for your computer, but for your future. Funny how a little silicon can help pay for a degree.
