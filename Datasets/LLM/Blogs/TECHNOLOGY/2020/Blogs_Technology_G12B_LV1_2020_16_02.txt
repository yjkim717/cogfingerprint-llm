>## The Shiny New Box, and What It Really Offers

Remember when new game editions felt *special*? Like a real upgrade? Lately, I’ve been thinking about that a lot, especially with the recent arrival of the "Hero Edition" of Minecraft Dungeons. It's got some cool cosmetics and a bit of extra content, sure, but is it enough to justify the price jump?

It feels like we’re in an era where "edition" often means "slightly prettier version of what you already have." We’re so used to iterative updates and microtransactions that the concept of a truly substantial upgrade feels almost… quaint. Maybe I'm just getting old, but I miss the feeling of opening a shiny new box and knowing you were getting a *lot* more than just a fresh coat of paint. What do you guys think? Are we expecting too much?
