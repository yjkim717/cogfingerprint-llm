**The Way We Talk is Changing – and Maybe That’s Okay**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was shifting, didn’t it? Even the way we communicated. I noticed it particularly in how we used emojis and shortened phrases – almost like tiny little grammatical shifts, a bit like clitics, you know? 

Reading about how pronouns and words are merging in languages like Czech and Malayalam got me thinking. It’s fascinating to see how languages naturally evolve, incorporating new ways of expressing ourselves. 

It’s similar to how texting and social media have subtly altered our language – we’re using abbreviations, dropping articles, and relying on context more than ever before.  Maybe this isn’t “wrong,” just a reflection of how we’re *actually* communicating in this increasingly digital world.  It’s a reminder that language is always in motion, always adapting.
