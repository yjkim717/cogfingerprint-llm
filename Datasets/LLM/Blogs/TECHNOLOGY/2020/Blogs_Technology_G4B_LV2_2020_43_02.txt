**The Little Helpers That Save You**

Remember 2020? It felt like a year of scrambling, right? I was wrestling with a particularly messy Django project, constantly battling code style issues and typos. Then I stumbled upon pre-commit hooks â€“ tiny scripts that run *before* you commit your code. Suddenly, it was like having a little team of helpers, automatically enforcing standards and catching errors. It felt amazing to build that pipeline, and honestly, it just made development so much smoother.  It's a surprisingly simple shift, but a huge win!
