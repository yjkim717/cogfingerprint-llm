As I pondered upgrading to a new tablet in 2020, my mind kept circling back to the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+. The large screen and S Pen stylus seemed like the perfect combination for reading and annotating PDFs. However, I couldn't shake off the concern that I'd be locking myself into a specific note-taking ecosystem. With so many great apps available, I worried about the file formats they used and whether I'd be able to export my notes easily. Would I be stuck with a proprietary format, or could I access my annotations across different devices? After some research, I realized that many popular note-taking apps now support open formats like PDF and allow seamless export. This flexibility gave me the confidence to take the plunge and consider the Tab S7+ as a viable option for my digital note-taking needs.
