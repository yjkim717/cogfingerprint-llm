>## The Ghost of Bundles Past (and My Smart Home Struggle)

It’s 2020, and I'm officially accepting that my smart home isn't going to be as seamless as the ads promised. Just spent an hour wrestling with my smart bulbs, trying to get them to *actually* dim instead of just… flashing aggressively. It reminded me of my first playthrough of Stardew Valley – obsessively tracking bundles, desperately trying to unlock the community center before winter hit.

Both felt like a promise of something better, a little bit of control in a chaotic world. Turns out, both require a surprising amount of troubleshooting and patience, and sometimes, it's just easier to flip a light switch. Anyone else feel like tech is perpetually one season behind our expectations?
