## The Little Server That Could (and How I Made it Secure-ish)

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2020, with cloud services seemingly swallowing the world whole, I found myself staring down the barrel of a good old-fashioned, standalone Windows Server 2019. No fancy Kubernetes clusters, no AWS Elastic Beanstalk – just a physical box in a server rack, humming quietly. This wasn't a planned architecture, more a legacy requirement for a small project. And I was responsible for securing it.

My budget? Let's just say "minimal." Big corporations with dedicated security teams weren't involved. This was a scrappy operation, and I'm pretty sure my security expertise peaked somewhere around properly configuring a home router.

The goal was simple: remote access, file transfer, and a general feeling of “this isn’t actively broadcasting vulnerability.” Remote Desktop was the obvious choice for access, but leaving that exposed felt… reckless. So, I dove into the world of HTTPS and Let's Encrypt. 

Honestly, navigating certificate generation and configuration felt like learning a new language. But the feeling of finally getting a free, trusted SSL certificate working on my little server? Pure victory. Then came setting up SFTP – a much safer alternative to FTP. A few tweaks to the firewall, and suddenly, I felt… better.

It wasn't perfect, of course. I’m sure a dedicated security professional would cringe at my setup. But for a solo developer on a tight budget, it felt like a decent win. It’s a reminder that security doesn’t always require massive investment. Sometimes, it’s just about making smart, informed choices and utilizing the readily available, often free, resources out there. And in a year like 2020, where everything felt uncertain, having a little piece of digital stability felt pretty good.
