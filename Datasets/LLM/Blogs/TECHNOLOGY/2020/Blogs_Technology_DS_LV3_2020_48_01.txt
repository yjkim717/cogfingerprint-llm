It’s 2020, and like many, I’ve been dreaming of a more sustainable future—starting with my next vehicle. When Rivian announced their mid-range models with that slick electrochromic roof, I was sold. I dove into spreadsheets, mapping out my financial planning with excitement. But months later, I’m still waiting. No updated pricing, no concrete details—just radio silence.

It’s frustrating. How can I commit when the numbers are a mystery? I feel stuck, my enthusiasm waning as practicality clashes with ambition. In a year full of uncertainty, you’d hope for a little clarity from the innovators promising change. Guess I’ll keep refreshing my browser, hoping for answers soon.
