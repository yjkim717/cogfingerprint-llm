As a sysadmin in 2020, I was stumped when I discovered a user had logged into their work computer with their personal Microsoft account instead of their Active Directory credentials. It raised a red flag about user authentication and security. I turned to Group Policy Objects (GPO) for a solution. By implementing a GPO to block Microsoft account sign-ins, I ensured our company's security protocols were upheld. It was a valuable lesson in staying vigilant and adapting to new challenges in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
