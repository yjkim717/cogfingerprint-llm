As I sat in front of my screen in early 2020, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with my Shopify store's limitations. As a seller catering to a global audience, I knew I was losing out on sales due to the lack of multicurrency checkout support. My customers in different countries were being deterred by the awkward currency conversion on checkout, and I was powerless to change it. I began to consider making the switch to WooCommerce, drawn by its promise of more flexible payment options. The thought of being able to offer my customers a seamless shopping experience, regardless of their location, was tantalizing. As I weighed my options, I wondered: was it time to leave Shopify behind and explore the possibilities of WooCommerce? The prospect was both exciting and daunting.
