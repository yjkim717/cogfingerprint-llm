It’s 2020, and like many, I’ve been filling my evenings with digital escapes. I dove into Minecraft Dungeons, charmed by its co-op chaos and polished gameplay. But as the credits rolled after just a few sessions, I couldn’t shake a nagging thought: was that really worth the price?

Now the store is tempting me with the Hero Edition, promising future content. But in a year full of uncertainties, from postponed game releases to shifting daily routines, I’m left wondering—should I invest in a promise? It feels like a microcosm of our tech-driven lives: do we pay for what *is*, or for the potential of what *might be*? For now, my wallet stays closed. I’ve learned that in 2020, tangible value matters more than ever.
