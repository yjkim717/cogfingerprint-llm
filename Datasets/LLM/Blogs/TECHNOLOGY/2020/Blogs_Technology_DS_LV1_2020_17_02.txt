### The Lonely Guardian: My Quest to Secure a Standalone Server

It started with a simple enough goal: build a robust, self-contained development server. No cloud, no complex network—just a single, powerful machine running Windows Server 2019 in my office closet. It would be my digital workhorse, accessible from anywhere via Remote Desktop, a secure conduit for files with SFTP, and a testbed for web apps over HTTPS. By early 2020, with the world suddenly shifting to remote everything, this project felt less like a hobby and more like a necessity.

But as I watched the news, a chilling reality set in. This machine I was building wasn't just a convenient tool; it was a giant, neon-lit bullseye. With RDP ports open to the internet, it was practically inviting script-kiddies and ransomware bots to a party I desperately didn't want to host. The "standalone" part of my plan began to feel less like "self-reliant" and more like "defenseless."

My journey into securing this digital fortress became an obsession. I wasn't just configuring services; I was learning the language of modern siege warfare. I dove into the bowels of Windows' Group Policy, crafting rules that felt like laying intricate traps for intruders. I wrestled with configuring the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security, creating layers of defense that would make an onion jealous. Every setting for RDP—from Network Level Authentication to limiting login attempts—felt like reinforcing a castle gate.

Setting up the SFTP server was a lesson in granting the absolute minimum permissions, and getting HTTPS running properly meant ensuring my TLS configurations were ironclad, banishing weak ciphers to the digital shadow realm.

In the quiet of 2020, this server became my personal project—a small, controlled environment where I could assert order amidst global chaos. The process taught me a profound respect for the silent, constant work of system administrators everywhere. My little standalone server in the closet is now more than just a tool; it's a reminder that in a connected world, vigilance isn't just a best practice, it's the entire foundation.
