It’s late 2020, and my Galaxy phone just got the Android 11 update. I was thrilled—until I tried to fire up my old emulators. Suddenly, my library of classic game ROMs, tucked safely on the SD card, was completely out of reach. Scoped Storage, they call it—a digital fence meant to protect my data, but it just locked away my nostalgia.

I spent hours searching forums, feeling that familiar mix of frustration and stubborn hope. It’s funny how a small tech change can disrupt a cherished ritual. In a year already full of disconnection, losing this little portal to the past stung. Here’s to hoping a workaround emerges soon—my inner 10-year-old is waiting to save Hyrule again.
