Okay, here’s a blog post inspired by the Bioshock Infinite summary, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone, suitable for 2020:

**The Loop We Keep Building**

Remember when we thought 2020 was going to be *the* year everything changed? A clean slate, a chance to build something new? Well, it’s been… complicated, hasn’t it? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how often we find ourselves trapped in loops – not necessarily grand, dramatic ones like Booker DeWitt in *Bioshock Infinite*, but smaller, more insidious ones in our own lives.

I was replaying *Infinite* recently, and it hit me with a force I hadn't anticipated. The game’s ending isn’t just a neat resolution; it’s a desperate plea to break free from a cycle of regret and repeating mistakes. It made me consider the way we use technology – how easily we get stuck chasing the next update, the next shiny app, the next instant gratification. 

We build these digital habits, these online routines, and without realizing it, we’re constructing our own little realities, repeating patterns of comparison, validation-seeking, and ultimately, dissatisfaction.  Like Comstock’s obsession with immortality, we’re trying to escape the pain of the past by endlessly recreating it, albeit in a pixelated, filtered version. 

It’s a daunting thought, but maybe the key, like Booker’s final act, is to acknowledge the loop, to recognize the choices that led us there, and to actively choose a different path forward.  Perhaps 2021 won’t be a fresh start, but it *can* be a conscious effort to step outside the cycle and build something genuinely new.
