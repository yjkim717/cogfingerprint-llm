**The Ghost in the Wireless**

Remember those early days of 2020? Everything felt… glitchy. Even my tech. I was building a new home office setup, excited about a sleek Logitech wireless mouse – a little escape from the chaos. But then it started: this unsettling lag, like a phantom hand slowing everything down. 

I spent hours troubleshooting – updating drivers (which were already up-to-date, naturally!), checking memory, even testing it on my old laptop. Nothing. It was just… there, a frustrating little hiccup. It felt bizarre, like the mouse itself was haunted. 

It made me think about how easily we can get frustrated with technology, assuming it’s *always* the problem. Sometimes, it’s just a ghost in the wireless, a tiny imperfection that throws off the whole system.  A reminder that even our digital tools have their quirks.
