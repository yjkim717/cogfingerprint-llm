**Zooming Through Frustration: My Bluetooth Speaker Blues**

Okay, 2020 – the year we all became Zoom experts (whether we wanted to be or not!). I was *loving* the convenience of my Bluetooth speaker, blasting music during work calls and feeling pretty productive. Then, things started to go sideways. 

Suddenly, my audio in Zoom meetings was… weird. Crackly, distorted, just plain *wrong*. It turned out, it was a classic iOS 13 incompatibility issue with Zoom and my Bluetooth setup.  I’d tried everything – restarting, updating, even swapping speakers temporarily. 

It was incredibly frustrating, especially when I was trying to present to clients on my iPad Pro.  It really highlighted how tech, even the stuff we think is seamless, can still throw a wrench in the works.  Lesson learned: always double-check compatibility!  Anyone else have similar Bluetooth Zoom struggles?
