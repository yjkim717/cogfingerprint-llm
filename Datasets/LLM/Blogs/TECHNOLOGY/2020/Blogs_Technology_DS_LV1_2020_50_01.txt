It’s 2020, and I’m finally diving into crypto—as a Canadian, it’s been a bumpy ride. I remember trying to buy more than pocket-change worth of Bitcoin, only to hit a wall: my bank wouldn’t play nice with most exchanges. Then I found Coinbase. Linking my account felt like a small victory, but those trading fees? Ouch.

It got me thinking: technology promises freedom, yet here I am, navigating digital gatekeepers and hidden costs. We’re building the future, but sometimes it feels like we’re just swapping old hurdles for new ones. Still, I press on—because maybe, just maybe, the system will evolve with us.
