As an ecommerce store owner on Shopify in 2020, I've encountered a common pain point: customers forgetting to apply discount codes during checkout. I wondered, is it possible to offer a discount after purchase? Remarketing efforts could be the key. By targeting customers post-checkout, I can remind them of the code, potentially boosting customer satisfaction and encouraging repeat business. It's worth exploring this strategy to stay competitive.
