It was supposed to be a simple upgrade. In the middle of 2020, with the world turned upside down, I finally built my dream PC. A sleek, powerful machine to conquer remote work and escape into virtual worlds. But my trusty Logitech wireless mouse, a veteran of my old laptop, had other ideas.

It started subtly. A tiny, random lag during a video call. A frustrating stutter in the middle of an intense game. I dove into the digital trenches. I scoured forums, updated USB drivers, and even blamed my desk surface. My wired mouse worked flawlessly, a silent accusation of betrayal from its wireless sibling.

It’s funny, isn’t it? In a year where we were all desperately trying to stay connected wirelessly, this small, intermittent lag felt like a metaphor. A tiny reminder that even the most reliable connections can falter, leaving you momentarily stranded, cursor spinning, waiting for the world to catch up.
