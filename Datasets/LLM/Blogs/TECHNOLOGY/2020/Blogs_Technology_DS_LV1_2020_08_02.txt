The constant hum of the refrigerator used to be background noise. In 2020, it became a drill boring into my skull. Living back with my parents during the lockdowns, our house was a symphony of sensory landmines: the sudden roar of the lawnmower, the blare of the television news cycle, the clatter of pans that made me flinch as if I’d been struck.

My Asperger’s means my brain doesn’t have a filter; it processes every sound at the same volume. A distant door slam is as jarring as someone shouting in my ear. This noise sensitivity, my heightened startle response, was always there, but the enforced, 24/7 proximity magnified it. I’d retreat to my room, seeking the blessed quiet that felt like a physical relief, only to be met with well-intentioned calls of “Why are you always hiding?” The tension wasn’t from a lack of love, but a canyon of misunderstanding. They saw solitude; I felt like I was performing constant, exhausting triage on my own nervous system.

As the days shortened, a familiar greyness descended—the early grip of seasonal depression. The lack of sunlight outside, combined with the auditory chaos inside, felt suffocating. My quest for quiet wasn’t just a preference; it was a necessity for my mental survival.

The breakthrough came not from them understanding my diagnosis, but from a shared moment of frustration. After I visibly jumped at the microwave beep, my mom finally asked, “What does that feel like?” I didn’t use clinical terms. I just said, “It feels like an electric shock, every single time.” Something shifted in her face. The next day, I found a pair of noise-cancelling headphones on my desk. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it was a gesture. It was a quiet acknowledgment in a loud world, a small step toward the peace we were all desperately searching for.
