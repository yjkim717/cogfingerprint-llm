>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone about technology in 2020. I've tried to capture a conversational style and a sense of personal reflection.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Glow of the Screen and the Weight of Connection**

Remember early 2020? The world felt… uncertain. And suddenly, our lives shrunk. My living room became my office, my kitchen my classroom, and my phone? Well, it became *everything*.

I'm not ashamed to admit I leaned on technology heavily. Video calls with family felt like a lifeline, those silly TikTok dances were a small comfort, and endless scrolling… a distraction. But lately, I’ve been noticing something. That familiar blue glow of the screen has started to feel less like connection and more like a weight.

It's ironic, isn’t it? We were trying to stay *connected* during a time of isolation, but were we really? Or were we just experiencing curated versions of reality, filtered through algorithms and carefully chosen angles?  I'm trying to be more mindful now, to put the phone down and just *be* present, even if it's just for a few minutes.  Anyone else feeling this shift? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
