It’s 2020, and I’m a freshman in this non-traditional CS program, surrounded by classmates who already have GitHub profiles full of green squares. Meanwhile, I’m over here staring at my blank resume, wondering if I should even bother applying for internships.

I’ve spent nights grinding through online tutorials, trying to catch up on coding basics while everyone else seems to be building full-stack apps. There’s this constant hum of anxiety—am I too far behind? Is it too late?

But then I remember: my path isn’t supposed to look like theirs. Every error message is a lesson, every small project a step forward. Maybe my unconventional route will teach me resilience they won’t find in a textbook. The goal isn’t to keep up—it’s to grow, one line of code at a time.
