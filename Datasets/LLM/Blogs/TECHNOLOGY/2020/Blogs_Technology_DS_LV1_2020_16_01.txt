It’s 2020, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how tech promises endless upgrades, yet sometimes leaves us wanting more. I remember diving into a game recently, excited for its new expansion. But instead of fresh challenges, it just piled on overpowered gear that trivialized the experience. It made me reflect: isn’t that what so much of tech feels like now? We get shiny updates and features, but do they really add depth or just inflate numbers? In a year where we’re craving meaningful connection and engagement, maybe it’s time to ask for substance over spectacle.
