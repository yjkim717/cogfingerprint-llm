Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone and a 2020 feel:

**The Ghosts in My Code: Why I Started Hating Macros**

Okay, let's be honest – 2020 was a weird year. I was deep in the trenches of a massive project, wrestling with a codebase that felt…well, *dirty*. It wasn't the bugs, though there were plenty of those. It was the macros. Specifically, the *unhygienic* ones. 

I'd stumbled across them early on, these sprawling blocks of code that seemed to magically do things, but with absolutely no clue *how* they were doing it. It was like finding a hidden room in a house – fascinating at first, then terrifying when you realized there were no doors or windows and you had no idea how to get back out.

It really hit me how much code clarity matters. Before, I was just trying to get things *working*, and these macros were a shortcut. But they created a tangled mess, making debugging a nightmare and, frankly, making *me* feel like a terrible programmer. 

I started researching, learning about hygiene – the concept of keeping macros isolated and predictable. It felt almost… therapeutic, like cleaning up a chaotic space. 

Looking back, it’s a small thing, but that shift in mindset completely changed how I approached my work.  It was a reminder that writing clean, understandable code isn’t just about being efficient; it's about respecting the code – and yourself – down the line.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the summary?
