It’s late 2020, and I’m settling into my new Galaxy phone, fresh with Android 11 and One UI 3.0. I’ve got my old emulators ready, a library of classic game ROMs tucked safely on my SD card—my little digital time capsule. But when I tap to load my favorite Zelda title… nothing. Scoped storage, they call it. A well-intentioned privacy fence, but it’s locked away my own files. My nostalgia, stranded just out of reach. It’s a strange feeling when a security update walls off a piece of your past. Progress isn’t always a straight path forward; sometimes, it asks you to leave something cherished behind.
