As I was diving into a new web development project in 2020, I found myself wondering: is there a better way to manage my JavaScript code? With multiple scripts scattered across various HTML files, it was getting messy. I started exploring the world of JavaScript modules and discovered that I could import multiple JS files into a single file using ES6 imports. This modular approach revolutionized my code organization. I could now break down complex scripts into smaller, reusable pieces, making my codebase more maintainable and efficient. By importing modules directly within my JavaScript files, I reduced the clutter in my HTML and streamlined my development workflow. It was a simple yet powerful change that significantly improved my productivity.
