It was supposed to be simple. In the fall of 2020, with the world feeling upside down, a new iPhone and a generous AT&T trade-in promo felt like a small, manageable win. A bright spot. I meticulously followed the instructions, mailed off my old device, and waited for the credits to roll in.

And I waited.

The first call to customer service was a masterclass in frustration. I was transferred, put on hold, and told conflicting stories. “The system doesn’t show it.” “You didn’t qualify.” Each call felt like shouting into a void, a dizzying loop of apologies and dead ends. That promised credit felt like a mirage, and my patience was evaporating. In a year where we all craved a little reliability, this experience was the opposite.

Just as I was about to give up, a friend suggested one last Hail Mary: find the district manager. I sent a carefully worded, firm but polite email. To my astonishment, it worked. Within days, a real person called me. They apologized, acknowledged the system error, and manually applied the promo.

The resolution was a relief, but the lesson was bigger. In an age of automated systems and distant corporate policies, perseverance and a direct human connection still matter most. My shiny new phone was great, but the reminder to never settle for a broken promise was even better.
