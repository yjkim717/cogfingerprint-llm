As I navigated the world of Skyrim, I realized I'd rather be a sneaky, dagger-wielding assassin than a stealth archer. Similarly, in 2020, I'm drawn to versatile tech tools that can adapt to any situation. Just as a melee-focused build requires strategy, a flexible tech setup demands a jack-of-all-trades approach. I'm ditching single-purpose gadgets for ones that can seamlessly switch between tasks, embracing the thrill of improvising with technology, just as I do with my Skyrim characters.
