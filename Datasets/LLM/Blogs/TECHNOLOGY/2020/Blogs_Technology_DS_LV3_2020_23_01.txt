It was the spring of 2020, and like so many of us, my iPad running iOS 13 had become my portal to the outside world. My days were a blur of Zoom meetings and Google Hangouts, a new digital reality I was trying to embrace. To make it feel a bit more normal, I’d connect my favorite Bluetooth speaker, hoping for rich, clear audio to cut through the isolation.

But a strange thing kept happening. I’d hop off a call where my colleague’s voice sounded tinny and distant, and immediately play some music. Instantly, my living room would be filled with the full, crisp sound I expected. The disconnect was jarring.

Why was the audio quality so stellar for my playlists but so poor for the human voices I desperately wanted to connect with? It felt like a cruel technological joke. In a year defined by finding new ways to be together, my own tools seemed to be placing a subtle, staticky barrier between me and the people on the other side of the screen. It was a small frustration, but in 2020, the small things mattered most.
