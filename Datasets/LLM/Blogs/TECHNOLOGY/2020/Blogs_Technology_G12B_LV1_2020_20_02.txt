>## The Ghost of Builds Past: Why My Old Gaming PC Still Holds a Special Place

It's funny the things you remember. I was just scrolling through old photos, and stumbled across a picture of my old gaming rig. A behemoth of a machine, built back in 2017. It featured a Ryzen 5 1600 and, crucially, a GTX 1080. At the time, it was *the* setup for high-resolution FPS gaming. 

Looking back, it feels almost quaint now, with the sheer power available in modern cards. But that PC holds a special kind of nostalgia. I spent countless hours chasing high framerates in *Destiny 2* and *Overwatch*, tweaking settings and overclocking (responsibly, of course!) to squeeze every last drop of performance. 

It’s a reminder of a simpler time in PC building – before the GPU shortages of 2020 made finding a decent card feel like winning the lottery. I actually considered selling it a while back, but something held me back. It's a tangible piece of my gaming history, a testament to a period of excitement and endless tinkering. Maybe I'll dust it off and fire it up again sometime soon, just for old time's sake.
