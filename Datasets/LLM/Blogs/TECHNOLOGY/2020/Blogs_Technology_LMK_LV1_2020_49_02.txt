As I frantically searched online in 2020 for solutions to my cat's peculiar behavior, I couldn't help but think of the parallel between my cat's insistence on pooping in inconvenient garage corners and our own digital habits. Just as my cat rejected the litter box, we often ignore the digital 'litter boxes' - our phone's storage and computer's desktop - until they're overflowing. I realized that just as I needed to address my cat's littering, I had to tackle my own digital clutter. A digital detox was just what I needed to regain control.
