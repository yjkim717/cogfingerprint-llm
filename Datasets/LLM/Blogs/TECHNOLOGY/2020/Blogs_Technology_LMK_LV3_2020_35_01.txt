As I navigated the digital landscape in 2020, I began to ponder: are we mere puppets on strings, controlled by the very technology we created? Thomas Ligotti's philosophical ideas echoed in my mind - born without consent, we limit our consciousness to cope with mortality. Similarly, our addiction to screens numbs us to the void within. Are we merely puppets, dancing to the algorithm's tune? This existential question haunts me, fueling a desire to break free from the digital chains that bind us, and reclaim our autonomy in a world where technology threatens to consume our very essence.
