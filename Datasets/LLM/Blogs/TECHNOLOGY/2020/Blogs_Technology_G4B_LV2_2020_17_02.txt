**The Lonely Server and My Worrying Thoughts**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much of our tech lives feels…isolated? I was wrestling with a project back in 2020 – setting up a brand-new Windows Server 2019 for a small client. A *stand-alone* server, really. Just him, just the software, just…me. 

As a sysadmin, my brain immediately started firing off all the “what ifs.”  I’d spent years dealing with sprawling networks, firewalls, and a constant barrage of alerts. This felt…different.  It was a single point of failure, a tiny, vulnerable island of data. 

Naturally, security was top of mind. I was obsessing over Remote Desktop – how to lock it down, how to monitor access, how to ensure he wasn’t accidentally leaving the door open to something nasty. It felt almost…criminal to be so focused on protecting something so solitary. 

There’s a strange vulnerability in a stand-alone server, I realized. It’s a stark reminder that security isn't just about complexity; sometimes, it’s about recognizing the inherent weaknesses in a simple setup. It forced me to really think about the core principles – least privilege, constant vigilance – and apply them with laser focus.  It was a valuable (and slightly unsettling) learning experience.
