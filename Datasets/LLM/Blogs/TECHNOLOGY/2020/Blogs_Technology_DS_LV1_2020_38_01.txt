### The Unseen Edit: A 2020 Reflection

It’s funny how a single typo can feel like a blinking neon sign on your resume. I remember spending an afternoon in the early pandemic haze, meticulously tailoring my application for a publishing internship. My English and Philosophy degree felt like a solid foundation, and I’d even scraped together some editorial experience from the university paper. I was proud of that cover letter.

Then I saw it. In the very first line, I’d written “manger” instead of “manager.” My heart sank. I’d been so focused on proving my big-picture editorial skills that a basic proofreading error had slipped through. In a world suddenly run on Zoom and digital-first impressions, that tiny mistake felt catastrophic. Was my academic background even competitive, or was I just another applicant with a typo?

That moment was a turning point. I started looking at technology not just as a tool for sending applications into the void, but as a partner in the craft. I discovered AI-powered grammar checkers that could catch what my tired eyes missed. More importantly, I realized that my humanities background wasn't a weakness in the tech age—it was the essential counterbalance. The algorithms could spot the misplaced comma, but I was the one who could tell a compelling story.

In 2020, we all learned to adapt. For me, that meant learning to let technology handle the ruthless precision of proofreading, freeing me up to focus on the human element: the narrative, the voice, the editorial heart that no software can replicate. It’s not about man versus machine; it’s about using one to perfect the other.
