As we navigated the uncharted waters of remote work in 2020, securing our Office 365 environment became a top priority. I was tasked with implementing geo-fencing to restrict access to our organization's resources based on a user's location. With our existing E3 licenses, I wondered if we had the necessary licensing to support conditional access policies. After digging into the details, I discovered that E3 licenses do come with some conditional access features, but we were missing out on some advanced controls. It turned out we needed to upgrade to at least P1 licenses to unlock the full potential of geo-fencing and conditional access. The experience was a valuable lesson in understanding the intricacies of Office 365 licensing and the importance of carefully evaluating our security needs. With the right licenses in place, we were able to bolster our security posture and protect our organization's data.
