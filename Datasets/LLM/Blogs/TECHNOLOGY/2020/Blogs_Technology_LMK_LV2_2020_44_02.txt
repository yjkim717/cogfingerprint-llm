As I sat in my dentist's chair in 2020, waiting for my routine checkup, I couldn't help but notice the eerie glow of the x-ray machine. It got me thinking - are dental x-rays safe, especially for the dentists who are exposed to them daily? I had recently met a few dentists who had battled cancer, and the concern lingered in my mind. Are medical professionals putting themselves at risk with every x-ray? The dental profession relies heavily on this technology, but at what cost? With the increasing awareness of radiation risks, it's natural to wonder if the benefits outweigh the potential harm. As we continue to advance in medical technology, it's crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with it. I'm not advocating for the abandonment of this vital diagnostic tool, but rather a thoughtful consideration of the measures in place to protect our medical heroes.
