**Building Worlds, One Packet at a Time**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020 felt like a constant scramble, but I’ve been spending my evenings lost in a surprisingly absorbing project: building a 2D multiplayer game from the ground up in C++.  I’m wrestling with the Steam API – a whole new beast – and trying to wrap my head around network programming. 

Honestly, it’s a humbling experience. You start with this grand vision, and then you’re staring at a sea of code, troubleshooting packet loss and praying for stable connections. It’s open source, which means I’m constantly learning from others, and that’s a huge relief.  Feels good to be building something tangible amidst all the chaos.
