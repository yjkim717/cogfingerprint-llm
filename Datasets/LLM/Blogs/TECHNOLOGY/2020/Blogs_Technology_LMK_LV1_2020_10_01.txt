"As I navigated the chaos of UBC's grad school in 2020, I found myself wondering - is there a better way? Commuting to campus was a daily headache, with traffic congestion and parking nightmares. But, as I settled into online courses, I realized that technology was both the problem and the solution. Video conferencing replaced grueling commutes, freeing up time for more meaningful pursuits. While the parking situation remains a challenge, I'm grateful for the flexibility that digital tools have brought to my academic journey."
