**The Sticky Note Struggle of 2020**

Remember 2020? It felt like a constant battle against digital chaos. I was seriously wrestling with finding a good system for my workflow, specifically around reading PDFs and actually *doing* something with the information. I’d been eyeing that Galaxy Tab S7+ – beautiful screen, perfect for a tablet note-taking experience – but my biggest worry was, honestly, the files. 

I’d spend ages trying to get PDFs to open correctly on my Windows machine, and then the frustration would build when my note-taking app just wouldn’t properly import everything. It felt like a constant cycle of exporting, importing, and losing precious notes.  It’s funny how a simple need for a decent note-taking app can feel so overwhelming!  Anyone else relate to this digital struggle?
