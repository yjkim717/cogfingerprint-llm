The nostalgia is real! As I was browsing Reddit in 2020, I stumbled upon a post that took me back to the good old days of browser-based games like OGame. The user was on the hunt for a game that allowed players to compose units using modular components, sparking a fascinating discussion. What caught my attention, though, was the user's own ideas for such a game, showcasing a node composer system that let players craft units from interchangeable parts. It got me thinking - what if game development took a similar approach? Imagine being able to build game mechanics using modular, reusable components. The possibilities are endless! As someone who's dabbled in game design, I can appreciate the complexity of unit composition and the creativity it unleashes. It's amazing to see enthusiasts driving innovation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in game development. Who knows what the future holds for browser-based games?
