As I sat amidst the chaos of graduation and grad school applications, I found myself parting ways with a trusty gaming rig I'd lovingly built in 2018. The Ryzen 5 1600AF and MSI B450I Gaming Plus AC combo had served me well, even doubling as a Hackintosh for some experimental fun. But with tuition fees looming, it was time to let go. I listed the components for sale, nostalgic for the late-night gaming sessions and coding marathons. Though it's hard to say goodbye, I'm excited to see my old rig find a new home and continue to game on in 2020.
