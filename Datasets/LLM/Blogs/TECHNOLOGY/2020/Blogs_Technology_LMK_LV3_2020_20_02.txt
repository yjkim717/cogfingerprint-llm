As a console gamer venturing into PC gaming in 2020, I wondered if an $850 second-hand rig with a GTX 1080 and Ryzen 5 1600 was a wise investment. For high-res FPS gaming, the answer lies in the hardware. The GTX 1080 is still a formidable GPU, capable of handling demanding games at 1440p. Paired with the Ryzen 5 1600's strong multi-threading, this PC can deliver a seamless gaming experience. If you're considering a similar setup, I'd say it's a solid choice - just be sure to check the PC's overall condition and compatibility with your gaming needs.
