## The Ghost in My Notifications

Remember 2020? Everything felt… muted. Even my phone. Scrolling through Instagram today, I saw a picture from a trip we’d planned, a year ago. It’s quiet now, the messages, the shared playlists. Just a ghost in the notifications, a reminder of connection lost. It's a strange kind of grief, isn’t it?

**Why I think this works:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** Uses phrases like "Remember 2020?" and "It's a strange kind of grief, isn't it?".
*   **Reflective:** It's not just stating facts, but exploring a feeling.
*   **Relatable:** Many people experienced a sense of loss and disconnection during 2020, particularly regarding relationships and plans.
*   **Technology Focus:** Centers around the experience of seeing reminders through technology (Instagram, messages, playlists).
*   **Subtle Echo of Original Summary:** The "ghost in the notifications" hints at feeling unseen and the loss of a relationship without being overly explicit.
*   **Word Count:** Around 60 words.
