Of all the endings I’ve experienced in games, the one that still haunts me years later isn’t from a blockbuster released last year, but from 2013’s *BioShock Infinite*. In the strange, isolated spring of 2020, as the world seemed to fold in on itself, I found myself revisiting its themes of choice, consequence, and the paths not taken. It felt less like a piece of entertainment and more like a digital prophecy I was finally old enough to understand.

The game follows Booker DeWitt, a man shackled by a violent past, on a mission to rescue a young woman named Elizabeth from the soaring, jingoistic city of Columbia. The city is a marvel, a floating testament to American exceptionalism run amok, ruled by the fanatical prophet, Zachary Comstock. But the real magic isn't in the sky-lines or the steampunk aesthetics; it’s in the “Tears”—ripples in reality that Elizabeth can manipulate, allowing her to peer into other possibilities, other worlds.

As the story unravels, we learn the devastating truth: Booker DeWitt and Zachary Comstock are the same person. At a pivotal moment—a baptism meant to wash away the sins of his brutal past—a single choice created a branch in reality. In one timeline, the man accepted the baptism, became the zealot Comstock, and built Columbia. In the other, he refused, remained as the broken Booker, and later sold his own infant daughter, Anna, to settle a debt… to Comstock. That infant would become Elizabeth.

The entire game is an ouroboros, an infinite, self-consuming loop of cause and effect. And the only way to break it, as the 2020 version of me sat in my living room, truly grasping it, is the most radical act of all: annihilation. Not of the villain, but of the choice itself. To save the infinite Elizabeths across all realities, Booker must be drowned at the baptism *before* the choice that creates Comstock can even be made. He must consent to his own erasure to prevent the entire tragic timeline from ever existing.

In a year defined by collective anxiety and a longing for a "reset," this fictional resolution hit me with the force of a real-world truth. We all carry our own versions of Comstock—the people we could have become if we’d made different choices, taken that other job, or said what we really felt. Our lives are a constant, quiet navigation of these alternate realities. Technology, especially in 2020, became our own version of a Tear. Our screens became portals to other lives—the friends on social media who seemed to be thriving in lockdown, the news feeds showing parallel worlds of information and misinformation. It was dizzying.

Booker’s ultimate sacrifice is a dark form of grace. It’s the acknowledgment that some knots cannot be untied; they must be cut. It asks a terrifying question: What sin is so great that the only path to redemption is to retroactively make it so you never needed redeeming in the first place?

*BioShock Infinite* isn’t just a story about a man saving a girl. It’s a profound meditation on the weight of our decisions and the peace that can only be found by finally, mercifully, letting go of the paths we didn’t take
