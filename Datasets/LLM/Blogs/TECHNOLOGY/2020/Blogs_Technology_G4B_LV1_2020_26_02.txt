**Remembering the ‘AF’ Dream**

It’s funny thinking back to 2020 and the sheer excitement of building a PC. I remember scouring forums like Reddit, hunting for deals on components like the Ryzen 5 1600AF – that “AF” felt like a badge of honor! Paired with an MSI B450i and Corsair Vengeance Lpx RAM, it was a surprisingly affordable way to dive into gaming.  HardwareSwap became my best friend.  It wasn’t about the specs alone, but the *process* of putting it all together. A little bit of frustration, a whole lot of triumph.  Those builds really defined the year, didn't they?
