Okay, here’s a blog post draft, aiming for a conversational tone and reflecting on the themes of linguistic evolution and adaptation, inspired by your summary and the 2020 context:

**The Ghost in the Algorithm**

Remember 2020? It felt like everything was shifting, right? Even the way we *talked* felt different. I was thinking about that a lot while staring at my phone, and it led me to something fascinating: the way language itself changes.

It reminded me of that blog post I read about how pronouns in languages like Czech and Malayalam started as little “clitics” - tiny, attached bits of words - and gradually morphed into something much more powerful through a process called grammaticalization. It’s like they gained a life of their own!

It got me wondering about AI and our digital interactions.  Think about how emojis have become so ingrained in our texting – they started as simple smiley faces, now they’re nearly grammatical in their use.  

Maybe AI is doing something similar, subtly shaping our language *through* the algorithms it uses. It’s like a ghost in the machine, a gentle pressure towards a new kind of communication.  Are we even aware of it?  It’s a weird thought, but one that’s definitely worth pondering as we navigate this increasingly digital world.

Would you like me to:

*   Adjust the tone or length?
*   Focus on a specific aspect of the idea (e.g., AI’s impact)?
