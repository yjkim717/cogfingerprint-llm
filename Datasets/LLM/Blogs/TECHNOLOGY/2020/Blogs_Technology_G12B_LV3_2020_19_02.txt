## The Digital High Ground

Remember that feeling in 2020 when everyone seemed to be mastering Zoom while you fumbled with muting? It felt like a crucial advantage, didn't it? Like whoever figured out the tech first had the "high ground" in this new digital landscape. Now, looking back, maybe it wasn't about who was *best* at the tech, but about adapting. Just like Obi-Wan and Anakin – remove the lava and that cliff, and things might have played out differently. It’s a good reminder: technology shifts, and resilience is the real superpower.
