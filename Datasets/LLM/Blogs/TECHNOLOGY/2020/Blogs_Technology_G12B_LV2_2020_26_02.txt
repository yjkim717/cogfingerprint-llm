>## Letting Go of the Tech, Chasing a Dream

It's funny how quickly things become… relics. Just a few years ago, my Ryzen 5 1600AF and MSI B450I Gaming Plus AC were the heart of my gaming rig. Countless late nights were spent battling digital foes and exploring virtual worlds with that setup. Now? They're up for sale.

Life takes unexpected turns, doesn't it? I'm diving headfirst into grad school applications, and every penny counts. It's a bittersweet feeling, parting with pieces of my hobby, but it’s all in service of a bigger goal. 

It's a reminder that technology, for all its power and connection, is ultimately just a tool. And sometimes, the best tools are the ones you temporarily set aside to build something new. Wish me luck!
