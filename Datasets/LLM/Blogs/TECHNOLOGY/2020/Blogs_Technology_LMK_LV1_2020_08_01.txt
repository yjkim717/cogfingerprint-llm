As I navigated the world of digital detoxing in 2020, I started to notice a weird phenomenon - my tolerance for loud notifications and cluttered social media feeds plummeted. It was like my mental bandwidth had been rewired. I began to crave simplicity and minimalism online, just as I had offline. Was this a sign of a digital detoxing symptom or a newfound appreciation for clarity? Either way, I'm embracing the calm and rethinking my tech habits.
