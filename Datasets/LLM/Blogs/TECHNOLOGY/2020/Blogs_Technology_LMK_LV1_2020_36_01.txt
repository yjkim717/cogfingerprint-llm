"As I walked into the computer lab in early 2020, I noticed something odd - a student was logged into their school laptop with their personal Microsoft account. I was taken aback. As a sysadmin, I knew this wasn't in line with our organization's security policies. We use Active Directory for user authentication, so I set out to find a way to prevent this from happening again. I discovered that Group Policy was the answer, and with some tweaking, I was able to restrict Microsoft account logins. Crisis averted - our AD accounts were safe once more!"
