**The Algorithm of Doubt**

Remember 2020? It felt like the world was stuck in a perpetual loading screen. I was staring at that same screen, trying to figure out my next move after graduating with a degree in Digital Media – and a nagging feeling that I was seriously behind. Everyone else seemed to have landed internships, built impressive portfolios, and were confidently navigating the job market. 

I’d skipped internships during college, prioritizing a part-time job to pay the bills. It felt like a huge gap, a digital black hole in my resume.  The thought crept in: “How can I break into tech without experience?” 

But then I realized something – the tech world, like everything else, was adapting. Online courses, personal projects, even contributing to open-source projects became viable ways to build skills. It wasn't about *what* you’d done, but *what* you were *doing* to prove your passion and potential.  Maybe the algorithm of doubt could be rewritten.
