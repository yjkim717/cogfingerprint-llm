"Reaching a milestone in my Xenogears Explained series. It's hard to believe it's been three videos in, and I'm excited to share that part 3 is finally live on YouTube. As someone who's been fascinated by this cult classic since its release in 1998, I'm thrilled to dive deeper into its intricate storyline and themes. Despite my busy schedule in 2020, with work-from-home life getting the better of me, I've managed to squeeze in some quality time to work on this project. The production quality has been a top priority, and I'm glad to say that the latest episode meets my standards. I'm grateful for the support of fellow gamers and fans who've been eagerly awaiting the next installment. As I continue to balance my time between work and passion projects, I'm looking forward to sharing more insights into this thought-provoking game."
