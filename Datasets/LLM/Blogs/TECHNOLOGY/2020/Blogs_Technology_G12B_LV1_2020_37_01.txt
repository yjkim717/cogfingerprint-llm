## The Joy of Broken Souls (and Random Stats)

Okay, hear me out. Lately, I've been diving back into *Dark Souls Remastered*, but with a twist. Iâ€™m using something called "paramdomizer" alongside a mod called PTDE. Basically, it randomly shuffles weapon stats and movesets. It's chaotic, hilarious, and surprisingly addictive. Suddenly, a mace might swing like a greatsword, or a dagger could unleash a flurry of fire. It's a bizarre, beautiful breakdown of game design, and a reminder that sometimes, the most fun comes from unexpected glitches. Anyone else experimenting with their games lately?
