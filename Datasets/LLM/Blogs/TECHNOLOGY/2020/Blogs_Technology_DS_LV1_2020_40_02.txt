### The Hype Machine and Me

I remember the lead-up to the launch of the PlayStation 5 in late 2020. My various online feeds were a swirling vortex of speculation. We weren't just getting a new console; we were getting a quantum leap in gaming, a revolution in load times, and controller haptics that would supposedly make us *feel* virtual raindrops. The hype, largely generated by us—the community—was intoxicating.

And then it arrived. The PS5 is fantastic, a genuine step forward. But did my first session feel like the transcendent, life-altering experience the online discourse had promised? Not quite. For a fleeting moment, I felt a pang of… disappointment. Not with the hardware, but with the chasm between the fever-dream I’d helped construct and the reality of a great, but still incremental, piece of technology.

This is the cycle we live in now, isn't it? We collectively overclock our expectations for the next big thing—be it a phone, a game, or a graphics card. We feed the hype machine until it’s roaring, and then we’re almost surprised when the actual product is merely "excellent" instead of "magic."

I’m learning to step back. The real innovation is impressive enough without us painting it in impossible, neon colors. The lesson from 2020? Sometimes, the most disruptive technology is the mute button on our own overhyping.
