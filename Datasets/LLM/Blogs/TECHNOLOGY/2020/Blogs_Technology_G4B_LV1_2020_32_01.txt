**The Day My Email Went AWOL**

Okay, 2020 was… a lot. But even amidst the chaos, I had a surprisingly stressful tech problem. My company’s Exchange server – the backbone of all our internal communication – started throwing a fit. Specifically, DNS queries were failing, and emails were just… vanishing. It was a slow-motion disaster.

We spent hours troubleshooting, and honestly, the initial suggestions felt a bit archaic. Then, a senior engineer remembered an old trick: disabling IPv6. Seriously. It turned out the new protocol was causing a weird conflict with the existing infrastructure. 

After a reboot of the transport services, *poof* – everything came back online. It was a bizarre reminder that sometimes the oldest solutions are the most effective.  It also highlighted how reliant we’d become on these newer technologies, and how important it is to understand the fundamentals beneath the shiny new features.  A little IPv6 debugging definitely put things into perspective!
