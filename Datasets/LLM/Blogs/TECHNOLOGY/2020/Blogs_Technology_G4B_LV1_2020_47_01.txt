**Remember When… Everything Was a Little Less Connected?**

Okay, 2020. It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? I was obsessing over upgrading my phone – a shiny new Pixel 5, desperately trying to capture the perfect sunset pic. It was *everything*. But looking back, there's a weird nostalgia for the days before constant notifications and endless scrolling. 

I remember actually *talking* to people, not just texting.  Suddenly, the idea of a weekend without my laptop feels… peaceful.  It’s funny how quickly we traded genuine connection for digital stimulation.  Maybe a little less tech, a little more real, is exactly what we needed.
