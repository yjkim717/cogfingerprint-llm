**My £300 Tech Rescue Mission**

Right, let’s be honest, my old PC was starting to sound like a grumpy badger – slow, wheezy, and generally unpleasant. I’d stubbornly clung to it for years, but it was time for a serious intervention.  I’m a bit of a budget-conscious gamer, so I was staring down a £300 upgrade limit. 

The challenge? My motherboard was ancient, rocking DDR3 RAM, and I knew I needed a massive speed boost.  I spent a worrying few days wrestling with compatibility – it’s terrifying how much things change!  Ultimately, I went for a snappy 250GB SSD to replace my painfully slow HDD, and a modest graphics card. 

It wasn’t glamorous, it wasn’t flashy, but the difference was *incredible*. Suddenly, games loaded faster, browsing felt responsive, and my grumpy badger had transformed into a reasonably cheerful chap.  It proved you don’t need to spend a fortune to breathe new life into old tech – sometimes, a focused upgrade is all you need.  What’s your oldest PC story?
