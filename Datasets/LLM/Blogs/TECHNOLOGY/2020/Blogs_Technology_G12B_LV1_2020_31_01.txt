## The Unexpected Comfort of a Well-Designed 404

Remember those frustrating 404 errors? Lately, I've been noticing how much better they are becoming. Postmanâ€™s 404, in particular, is brilliant - a little animated illustration, a touch of humor, and a clear path back. It's a tiny interaction, but it elevates a negative experience. It made me think: how often do we prioritize delightful design even in failure states? Maybe a little creative kindness in the digital world goes a long way.
