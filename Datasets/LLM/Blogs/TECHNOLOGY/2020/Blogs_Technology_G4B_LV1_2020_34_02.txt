**The Great Grill Debate of 2020**

Okay, so I’ve been obsessing over a new Yoder pellet grill – the YS640, specifically. It’s gorgeous, and the smell of smoked brisket is calling my name. But then I started thinking about getting it delivered versus hauling it myself.  

My neighbor, Mark, has a pickup, and he offered to bring it. The shipping quote from Yoder, though? Seriously hefty. It’s weird, right?  We’re in 2020, ordering massive appliances online, yet the simplest decision felt like a logistical puzzle.  I’m still wrestling with it – the convenience versus the satisfaction of a little DIY muscle.  Anyone else face this tech-meets-reality dilemma lately?
