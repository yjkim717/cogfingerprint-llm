**The Glitch in My Reflection**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we’re constantly chasing connection in 2020, glued to screens, trying to bridge the distances that suddenly felt so vast. We built this incredible web of technology – instant communication, endless information, the ability to share our lives with anyone, anywhere – and yet, sometimes I feel like it’s creating a kind of…distance *within* ourselves. 

I was staring at my reflection the other day, really *looking* at it, and it hit me with a strange intensity. The blue light of my laptop was casting this eerie glow, and I noticed how carefully I was posing, angling my face just so to look… presentable online. It felt performative, almost like I was trying to manufacture a version of myself for an audience I wasn’t even sure existed beyond the digital realm. 

It reminded me a little of *Bioshock Infinite*, that game I played obsessively a few years back. The whole thing is built on this idea of alternate realities, of echoes and choices repeating themselves. Booker DeWitt, trapped in a loop, desperately trying to fix a past he couldn't escape.  

There’s a part of me that feels like we’re all living a similar, albeit less dramatic, version of that story. We’re constantly projecting, curating our online personas, and chasing validation through likes and comments. We’re so focused on *appearing* to have it all figured out, that we forget to actually *feel* it. 

I don’t think technology is inherently bad, of course. It’s a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or for… well, for capturing the perfect selfie. But lately, I’ve been trying to actively resist the urge to let it define me. To look beyond the screen and really see myself, flaws and all.  It’s a small thing, a quiet rebellion, but it feels profoundly important in a year that’s already felt so overwhelmingly mediated.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or changing the tone slightly?
