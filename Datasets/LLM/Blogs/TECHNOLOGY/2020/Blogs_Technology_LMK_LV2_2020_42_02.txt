My wife and I were trying to conceive, and the thought of a DIY solution was both intriguing and unsettling. Were these kits a legitimate shortcut or a false promise? As I dug deeper, I realized that technology was blurring the lines between convenience and medical expertise, leaving me to wonder: can a simple kit truly replace the guidance of a fertility specialist?
