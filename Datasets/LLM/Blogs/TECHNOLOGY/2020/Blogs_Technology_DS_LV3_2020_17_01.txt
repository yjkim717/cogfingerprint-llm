It’s 2020, and I’m eyeing the Galaxy Tab S7+ like it’s my ticket to digital nirvana. I dream of scribbling notes directly onto PDFs, of a paperless life where my thoughts live seamlessly across devices. But then reality taps me on the shoulder.

What if my notes get trapped in some obscure file format? Will I need a pricey subscription just to access them on my laptop or phone tomorrow? It’s not just about the tablet—it’s about freedom. I want to annotate a research paper here, review it there, without jumping through hoops or feeding another monthly fee.

In a world pushing us online, the tools we choose should connect, not confine. Here’s to hoping for tech that truly works for us, everywhere.
