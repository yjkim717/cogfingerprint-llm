**The Shiny Promise & The Empty Box**

Remember 2020? It felt like *everyone* was chasing the next big thing – new VR headsets, hyped-up gaming PCs, the promise of a digital escape. I was right there with them, eagerly anticipating the launch of [mention a popular 2020 game or tech release – e.g., *Cyberpunk 2077*]. The marketing was incredible, the community buzzing with excitement. 

I pre-ordered everything, built the perfect setup... and then it arrived. It was…fine. Really good, even. But the initial rush? The sheer, unadulterated *hope*? It was gone. 

It struck me then, and it still does, that we’re often so caught up in what *should* be amazing that we forget to actually *experience* it. Like Destiny 2’s Mythoclast – a powerful exotic weapon, sure, but sometimes the hype outweighs the actual enjoyment.  

Maybe we need to dial back the expectations a little.  Focus on the moments, not the grand, pre-packaged promise.  What do you think?
