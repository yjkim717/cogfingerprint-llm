## The Hum of the Machine and a Quiet Worry

It's funny, isn't it? We’re living in this age of incredible technological advancement, constantly surrounded by devices that promise to make our lives easier, healthier, even longer. I work alongside a brilliant dentist, and the digital x-ray machine is a game-changer – pinpoint accuracy, instant images, far less radiation than the old film days. 

But lately, I've been thinking a lot about the *cumulative* effect. As a dental nurse, I'm exposed to these low-level rays multiple times a day, every day. It’s a tiny dose, I know, and everyone assures me it's safe. Yet, the constant stream of information about radiation and potential risks (you see those articles!) sticks with you. 

It’s a weird paradox. We embrace these incredible tools for our benefit, while a small part of you wonders about the long game.  Is there a silent price to progress? I guess that’s a question we'll all be pondering more and more as technology continues its relentless march forward. Just a quiet musing on a Tuesday in 2020.
