>## The Algorithm and Me: A 2020 Reflection

Remember 2020? The year the world collectively learned to Zoom, and algorithms became… well, *everything*? I do. It feels like a lifetime ago, and yet, the shift in our relationship with technology still reverberates. 

Before, I thought of the internet as a tool. Useful, sure, but ultimately controlled. Then came the relentless scroll, the perfectly curated feeds, the targeted ads that felt a little *too* personal. Suddenly, it felt less like I was using technology, and more like it was using me. 

I started noticing patterns. My mood subtly influenced the content I consumed, which in turn, influenced my mood further. It was a feedback loop, and honestly, a little unsettling. I felt myself drifting, passively absorbing whatever was thrown my way instead of actively seeking out knowledge or connection.

This year, I've been trying to reclaim some agency. Small things, really. Turning off notifications, consciously choosing podcasts over endless scrolling, and remembering that the “perfect” life I see online isn't necessarily real. It’s a highlight reel, crafted by algorithms to keep me engaged. 

It's a constant effort, this mindful navigation of the digital world. But I believe it’s a necessary one. Because ultimately, technology should serve *us*, not the other way around. And maybe, just maybe, we can break free from the algorithmic echo chamber and rediscover the joy of genuine connection, both online and off.
