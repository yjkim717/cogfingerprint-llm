## The Blue Light Struggle is Real (and I'm Tired)

Okay, let's be honest. 2020 has been *a lot*. And somewhere along the way, my relationship with my phone took a serious nosedive. It started innocently enough – a quick scroll through the news, a few minutes of TikTok to de-stress. But now? It feels like a constant battle. 

I find myself reaching for it even when I *know* I shouldn’t. Late at night, when my brain should be winding down, I’m lost in an endless loop of Instagram reels. Then, I wake up feeling…fuzzy. Drained. Like I haven't really slept at all. 

It's a weird parallel to parenting, actually. Establishing boundaries with my devices is just as crucial as setting bedtime routines for my kids. The blue light is the ultimate toddler, resisting every attempt at a peaceful shutdown. Anyone else feeling this digital exhaustion? Help!
