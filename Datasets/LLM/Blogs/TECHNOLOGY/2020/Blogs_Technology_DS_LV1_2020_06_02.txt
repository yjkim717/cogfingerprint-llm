You know what’s wild? In 2020, I started a deep-dive video series on *Xenogears*, thinking I’d knock it out in a few weeks. I had all this time during lockdown—or so I thought.

But life, as it does, had other plans. Between remote work, helping my kid with online school, and just… surviving, my grand plans for crisp 4K footage and studio-quality audio started to feel like a distant dream. I remember editing Part 3 late at night, headphones on, trying not to wake anyone, while wrestling with background hum in my recordings.

It hit me then: production quality isn’t just about gear or skill—it’s about time, space, and quiet. And in a year when all three felt scarce, just finishing something felt like a triumph. Funny how a 1998 RPG taught me more about 2020’s reality than I ever expected.
