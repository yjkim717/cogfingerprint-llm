"Navigating the Uncharted: My CS Freshman Year in 2020

As I sat in my intro to programming class, surrounded by students who had been coding since high school, I felt a wave of uncertainty wash over me. I was a CS major in a non-traditional program, and I worried that I was already behind. My university's CS program was designed for students with prior experience, and I was starting from scratch. I knew I needed to get on track fast if I wanted to land internships and eventually ace coding interviews. So, I threw myself into online resources like LeetCode and GitHub, and started building projects to boost my resume. It's been a wild ride, but I'm determined to succeed. I'm learning that with persistence and the right guidance, even a non-traditional CS major can thrive in the tech world."
