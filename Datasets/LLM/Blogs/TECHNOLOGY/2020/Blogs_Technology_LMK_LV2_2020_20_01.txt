"Navigating the Uncharted: My CS Freshman Year Journey"

As I sat in my 2020 summer coding boot camp, surrounded by peers who had been coding since high school, I felt like an imposter. I was a freshman in college, enrolled in a non-traditional 2+3 CS program, and I had no idea how I was going to catch up. My resume was sparse, and the thought of coding interviews made me anxious. But as I began to share my struggles with fellow students and mentors, I realized I wasn't alone. We were all trying to figure it out together. I started to focus on building my skills, and seeking out internships to gain practical experience. It wasn't easy, but with each small win, my confidence grew. To anyone starting their CS journey, I say this: it's okay to feel lost - it's how you navigate the uncertainty that matters.
