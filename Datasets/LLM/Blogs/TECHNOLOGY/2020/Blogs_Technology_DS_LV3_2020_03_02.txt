The year 2020 reshaped everything, including my relationship with technology. Before the pandemic, my phone was a distraction—endless scrolling, superficial connections. But when lockdowns hit, those glowing screens became lifelines.

I remember my first virtual family gathering from my tiny apartment. My grandmother’s pixelated smile, my cousins laughing from different time zones—it was imperfect, but profoundly human. Technology wasn’t isolating us; it was stitching our lives together across the silence.

Then came the online courses. I’d always resisted them, preferring the energy of a classroom. But learning to code through a screen taught me discipline I never knew I had. The same tools that delivered groceries also delivered knowledge, making growth possible when the world stood still.

Now, I see tech differently. It’s not just convenience; it’s resilience. It’s the bridge over unexpected distances, the quiet engine of perseverance. In a year of separation, it helped me hold on—to family, to learning, to hope.
