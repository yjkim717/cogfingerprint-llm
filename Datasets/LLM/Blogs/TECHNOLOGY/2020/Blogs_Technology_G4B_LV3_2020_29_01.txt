**The Siren Song of the “Quick Fix” Macro**

Remember 2020? It felt like we were all desperately trying to build *something*, anything, to get through the chaos. And sometimes, that meant reaching for the shiny object – a macro. I definitely got caught in that trap.  A little snippet of code to automate a tedious task seemed brilliant at the time. 

But honestly, staring at that sprawling, undocumented macro a few months later… it felt like a tangled mess. It was convenient, sure, but at what cost?  It sacrificed code clarity for speed, and suddenly, scope became a terrifying unknown. 

It really hammered home a crucial lesson: the most efficient solution isn’t always the best.  Clean, well-defined code – even if it takes a little longer upfront – builds stability and prevents those frustrating, unexpected side effects.  Let’s prioritize clarity, folks.  Our future selves will thank us.
