>Okay, here's a blog post inspired by Ligotti's ideas about puppets and consciousness, framed within a 2020 tech context, aiming for a conversational and reflective tone:

## Are We Just Upgrading Our Strings?

It's 2020. We're all glued to screens, aren't we? Scrolling, liking, sharing… building meticulously curated online personas. Lately, I’ve been having this unsettling feeling, a kind of digital existential dread, and it all keeps circling back to something I read about the philosopher Thomas Ligotti.

Ligotti, in a wonderfully bleak way, suggests we’re all puppets. Not in a whimsical, fairytale sense, but in a far more disturbing one. We're both controlled *and* controling – performing roles, pushing narratives, desperately trying to distract ourselves from… well, *everything*. And the idea that consciousness itself might be a limited function, a safety mechanism to avoid the sheer horror of existence? It’s genuinely chilling.

And looking at technology, particularly social media, it feels like we're just upgrading our strings. Algorithms subtly nudge us, personalized feeds reinforce our biases, and the pursuit of likes and validation becomes a new, shiny form of puppetry. We think we're choosing, but are we really? Or are we just responding to the invisible pulls of code and social pressure?

Maybe I’m being dramatic. But I can’t shake the feeling that we're building increasingly elaborate stages for our collective performance, while the audience… remains unseen. And the play? It’s getting awfully repetitive.
