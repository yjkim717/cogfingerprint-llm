"Stepping into the Tech World: Did I Miss Out on Valuable Internships in 2020?"

As I reflect on my college years, which culminated in a degree in Computer Science in 2020, I often wonder if I made a critical mistake that might impact my career development. With the tech industry being as competitive as ever, I sometimes think about the internships I didn't land. My concerns are not just about the hands-on experience I might have missed but also the networking opportunities that could have potentially opened doors to top tech firms.

I recall the chaos of 2020 - the pandemic had just hit, and the world was in lockdown. Many companies put their internship programs on hold, and it seemed like the entire world was at a standstill. While some of my peers managed to secure remote internships, I wasn't among them. Now, as I look to start my career, I worry that this gap might make me less competitive.

However, I've come to realize that my college projects, personal coding endeavors, and contributions to open-source projects are valuable experiences in their own right. They demonstrate my skills and dedication to potential employers. While internships can be beneficial, they're not the only path to gaining relevant experience. Perhaps, my story can serve as a reminder that in a competitive field like tech, it's not just about what you've done, but also about showcasing your skills and perseverance.
