As I dived back into Minecraft Dungeons in 2020, I couldn't help but wonder: will new updates breathe life into this action-packed game or simply flood it with more unbalanced items? The apocalypse difficulty level had already pushed me to the limit, and I was eager to see how new content would shake things up. Will we see meaningful additions that enhance gameplay, or just more of the same? The NPCs, once charming, now felt like a sideshow. I'm holding out hope that the developers will take a step back and rebalance the game, rather than just adding more chaos to the mix.
