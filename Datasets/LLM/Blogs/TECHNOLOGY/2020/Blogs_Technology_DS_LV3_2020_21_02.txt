It was early 2020, and like many, I found myself diving back into Minecraft for comfort. As a server admin, I faced a dilemma: how to handle death penalties. The hardcore "lose everything" rule felt too punishing for my casual friends just looking to unwind. I wanted them to feel a sting—enough to care about survival—but not so much that losing a prized pickaxe meant logging off for good. So, we tried something new: a "Gravekeeper" plugin. Now, when you die, your items are safely stored in a grave at the spot, waiting for you to return. It’s a gentle nudge, not a slap—keeping the thrill alive without the frustration.
