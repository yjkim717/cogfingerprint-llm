## The Scroll and the Sigh: Feeling Overwhelmed in 2020

It's 2020, and if you're anything like me, you're probably feeling a low-grade hum of frustration most of the time. It's not always a *big* thing, but a constant weight. Lately, I've realized a lot of it stems from… the scroll. 

Endless news feeds, constant updates, the sheer volume of information flooding our screens – it’s exhausting. We’re hyper-connected, yet somehow increasingly isolated in our own anxieties. I find myself snapping at my partner, feeling inexplicably angry at the world, and then realizing I've been mindlessly scrolling for an hour. 

Anyone else feeling this? It's okay to disconnect, to put the phone down, and just *be*. Our mental health needs it, especially now.
