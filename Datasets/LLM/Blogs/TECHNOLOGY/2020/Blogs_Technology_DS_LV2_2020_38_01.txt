### The Glitch That Grounded Me

It was March 2020, and my world had just shrunk to the size of a laptop screen. Like everyone else, I was trying to build a career from my couch. My entire professional identity was digital—a portfolio website, a LinkedIn profile, a perfectly curated resume PDF.

Then I saw it.

A typo. A glaring, humiliating "managment" in the skills section of the resume I’d sent to a dozen dream companies. My heart sank. In a world where I couldn't shake a hand or make eye contact, that single red squiggle from a spellcheck felt like a public declaration of my incompetence. I was convinced I’d already lost before I even started.

But that tiny error forced a bigger realization. In our rush to master complex software and build flawless online personas, we’d forgotten the power of a simple, human skill: proofreading. Technology connects us, but it also amplifies our smallest mistakes. My laptop wasn't the problem; my reliance on it to catch everything was.

So, I took a breath. I printed my resume—something I hadn't done in years—and read it aloud. I found two more subtle errors. It was a small, analog ritual in a digital age, but it was grounding. It reminded me that we aren't just profiles and pixels. We are people, capable of both mistakes and meticulous care. That little "glitch" didn't break my chances; it taught me to build them with more intention.
