Remember those early 2020 lockdown days? Stuck inside, I dove back into Minecraft, a digital comfort food. But my builds and chests were scattered across servers, a messy digital life mirroring the chaos outside.

Then I found MinecraftArchives. Suddenly, I could curate my kits and map arts, creating a little museum of my pandemic progress. It was more than an archiving tool; it was a way to find order and preserve memories when the real world felt so temporary. A small, pixelated anchor.
