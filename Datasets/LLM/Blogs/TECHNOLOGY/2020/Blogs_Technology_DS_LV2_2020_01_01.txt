Looking back at 2020, I realize how much tech became my sanctuary. Stardew Valley bundles were my escapeâ€”each completed room a small victory when the world felt stuck. That Crafts Room? It mirrored my own need to create order. Funny how a pixelated farm taught me to tackle daunting tasks, one small, satisfying step at a time.
