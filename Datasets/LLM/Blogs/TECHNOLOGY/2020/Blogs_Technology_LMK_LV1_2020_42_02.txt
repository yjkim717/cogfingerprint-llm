As we navigated 2020, my partner and I found ourselves trying to conceive. We dove into the world of fertility treatments, weighing options like IUI and IVF. But then we stumbled upon home insemination kits - a tempting DIY alternative. Were they effective? We dug in, researching how they stacked up against clinical treatments. With tech advancing rapidly, it's no surprise that fertility is getting a digital boost. But does convenience trump medical guidance? We explored the pros and cons, and I'm sharing our journey to help others make informed decisions.
