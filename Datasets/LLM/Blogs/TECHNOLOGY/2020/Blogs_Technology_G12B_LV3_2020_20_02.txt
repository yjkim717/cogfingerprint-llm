## The Allure of the Secondhand Build

So, I'm taking the plunge into PC gaming! It's 2020, and the graphics are just *calling* to me. But, being realistic, a brand-new rig is… daunting. I stumbled across a secondhand deal – GTX 1080, Ryzen 5 1600 – and I'm second-guessing myself. Is it worth the risk for crisp FPS at higher resolutions? Hoping to hear your experiences!
