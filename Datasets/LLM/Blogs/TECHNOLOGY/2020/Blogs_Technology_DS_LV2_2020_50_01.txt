It’s 2020, and I’m sitting at my kitchen table, scrolling through crypto exchanges like I’m swiping through dating profiles. All I want is to link my bank account and make a solid investment without losing half of it in fees.

I tried Coinbase first—simple, sure, but those fees stung. So, I dove into the world of Canadian alternatives, hunting for that sweet spot: security, ease, and fair pricing. It felt like searching for a needle in a digital haystack, but finally landing on one that clicked? Pure relief. It’s funny how a little tech can make or break your financial confidence.
