**The Endless Scroll of 2020**

Remember 2020? It felt…sticky.  Like endlessly scrolling through Twitter, searching for something real amidst the constant updates and anxieties. I found myself doing a similar thing with *Escape From Tarkov*, obsessed with optimizing every little detail, chasing that perfect killstreak. It was a grind, a serious one. 

I realized I was sacrificing genuine enjoyment for the *idea* of progress.  Like that Ironman player needing a break from questing, I needed to step back.  Maybe the point isn’t the flawless run, or the highest score, but simply taking a breath and appreciating the world – even if it’s just a pixelated one on a screen.  Anyone else feel that pull?

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a blog post on a completely different topic?
