"Trapped in a World of Too Much Noise: My Pandemic Struggle with Sensory Overload"

As I sit here in my childhood bedroom, surrounded by the familiar walls that once brought me comfort, I'm reminded of the unexpected challenges that came with the pandemic. For me, a person with Asperger's, the lockdown was more than just a disruption to my routine - it was a sensory minefield.

With my parents at home 24/7, the noise level in our house skyrocketed. The constant chatter, the clanging of pots and pans, the sound of the TV blaring in the background... it was all too much. My brain, already wired to be more sensitive to noise, was overwhelmed. Simple tasks like focusing on a task or even just relaxing became daunting challenges.

As the days blurred together, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of sound. I longed for the peace and quiet of my pre-pandemic life, when I could escape to my own space and recharge. But that was no longer an option.

In a world where technology usually provides a escape, I found myself turning to it for solace. I downloaded noise-cancelling apps, wore headphones to block out the chaos, and even experimented with ASMR videos to calm my frazzled nerves. It wasn't a perfect solution, but it helped.

As I navigate this new reality, I'm reminded of the importance of autism acceptance and understanding. It's not just about tolerating differences, but embracing them. By sharing my story, I hope to raise awareness about the struggles that many autistic individuals face, and the creative ways we find to cope. In a world that can be overwhelming, it's okay to seek help - and to find solace in the most unexpected places.
