"The Frustrating Truth About Zoom Meetings on Bluetooth Speakers

As I settled into my latest virtual meeting via Zoom on my iPad Pro 2018, I was excited to enjoy a hands-free experience with my trusty JBL Charge Bluetooth speaker. It was 2020, and remote meetings had become the new norm. However, my excitement was short-lived. The audio quality was abysmal - choppy, distorted, and barely audible. I was running iOS 13, and I wondered if that was the culprit. After some troubleshooting, I discovered that others had experienced similar issues. It seemed that the combination of Zoom, Bluetooth, and iOS 13 was a recipe for disaster. I switched to my iPad's built-in speakers, and the quality improved dramatically. While Bluetooth speakers are convenient, it seems they're not yet perfect for critical video calls. Has anyone else experienced this issue? I'm still on the hunt for a reliable, high-quality Bluetooth solution for my Zoom meetings."
