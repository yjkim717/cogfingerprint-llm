>## The Balancing Act of Being (Almost) Done

It's wild to think I'm nearing the end of my Computer Science degree. 2020 has been... a year, hasn’t it? Between the pandemic scrambling everything and juggling an internship at a local tech startup, I’m feeling the pressure. My scholarship has a specific requirement – a certain number of upper-level CS credits. Finding a class that's both manageable *and* fulfills that requirement feels like a mini-puzzle. 

Right now, I'm pouring a lot into my research project, hoping it’ll be a solid addition to my portfolio. It's a lot, but the feeling of building something tangible is pretty incredible. Just gotta find that *one* perfect class to tie it all together!
