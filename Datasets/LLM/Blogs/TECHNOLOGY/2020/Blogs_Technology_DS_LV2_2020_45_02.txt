Remember those early pandemic days in 2020, when we were all suddenly glued to our screens? I found myself diving into a fascinating browser game where you didn't just play—you built. The core idea was brilliant: designing custom units by snapping together modular components, like digital LEGO, and then selling your best blueprints to other players.

It hit me that this wasn't just a game; it was a tiny, self-contained economy. We were all becoming creators, not just consumers. In a year when so much felt out of our control, there was something deeply satisfying about building and trading something uniquely mine. It made me wonder if this is the future of tech—not just using tools, but truly owning and shaping our digital experiences.
