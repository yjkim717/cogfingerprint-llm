Remember those endless Zoom calls in 2020? That’s when I first sketched the timeline archive idea. Staring at a grid of faces, I craved a richer way to share our team’s journey—more than just a blog. I wanted to embed our chaotic Google Docs, milestone screenshots, and celebratory GIFs into a living, scrollable story. The first prototype was clunky, but the feedback was electric. It wasn't just documenting work; it was about crafting a shared memory, making our digital isolation feel a little more human.
