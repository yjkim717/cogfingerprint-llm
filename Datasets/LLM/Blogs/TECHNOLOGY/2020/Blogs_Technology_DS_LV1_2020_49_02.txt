My Persian rug has seen better days, and it’s not from wear and tear. It’s become the preferred “litter box” for my cat, Oliver. We’ve ruled out medical issues, so it’s a clear case of **inappropriate elimination** rooted in a **behavioral** protest. I’m on a mission to solve this. I’ve moved the **cat litter box** to a quieter **location** and have started positive reinforcement **cat training**. Fingers crossed my rug survives his artistic expressions.

It was technology I'd taken for granted that suddenly became a lifeline, a tether to a normalcy that felt a million miles away. It taught me that connection, even digital, is everything.
