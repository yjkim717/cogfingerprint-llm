## Diving Deep: Why I’m Obsessed with Explaining Old Games (and Why You Might Be Too)

It's 2020, and we're all connected in ways we never imagined. Lately, I've been pouring my free time into something a little…retro. I’m creating video essays about *Xenogears*, a PlayStation RPG from the late 90s. Sounds niche, right? Maybe. But it's been surprisingly fulfilling.

There’s something truly special about revisiting these older games – uncovering layers of narrative and design that might have been missed the first time around. I started this project just to solidify my own understanding, really. But the response has been amazing! People genuinely seem to connect with the analysis, and I’m learning so much from their feedback. 

It's a reminder that even in a world saturated with new technology, there's a deep appreciation for the classics, and a desire to understand them better. If you’re looking for a little nostalgia and a deeper dive, check out the series – and let me know what you think!
