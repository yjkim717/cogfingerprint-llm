**The Ghost in the SD Card**

Remember those late nights in 2020, desperately trying to get a perfect ROM running on your Android emulator? I do. I was chasing a sweet, stable Fire Emblem experience, and my Galaxy S10 was my trusty testing ground. Then, Android 11 hit, and suddenly, everything went…weird. 

My emulator just couldn’t seem to find my SD card. It was like the device had vanished, a digital ghost haunting my setup. Turns out, Android 11’s new scoped storage was the culprit, messing with how emulators accessed external drives. 

It was frustrating, honestly. A small change, a huge roadblock. It made me think about how deeply we rely on these little bits of tech – our SD cards, our emulators – and how a single update can throw a wrench in everything.  Anyone else run into this?
