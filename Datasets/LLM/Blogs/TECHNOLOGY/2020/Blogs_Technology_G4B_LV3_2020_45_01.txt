**The Quiet Rebellion of Backend Abstraction**

It’s funny what pulls you into the tech world, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been digging into this fascinating little project called FatCoach – a BaaS framework built with Kotlin.  Honestly, the name itself felt a bit… weighty. But the core idea? It’s surprisingly refreshing. 

We’ve all wrestled with GraphQL, right? Powerful, but sometimes feels like a tangled web of schemas and resolvers. FatCoach’s aim is to strip away that complexity, letting front-end devs focus purely on the user experience.  It’s like giving them a clean slate, and letting the backend handle all the messy details. 

What’s really interesting is the query language they’re building – something designed to be *more* flexible than GraphQL. It feels like a quiet rebellion against the rigid standards we’ve become accustomed to.  In 2020, with everyone scrambling to build and scale, the promise of simpler backend operations feels incredibly valuable.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most innovative solutions are about making things easier, not just more powerful.
