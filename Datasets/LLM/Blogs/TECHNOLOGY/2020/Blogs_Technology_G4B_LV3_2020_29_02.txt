**The Tightrope Walk of Macros**

Okay, confession time: I’ve been wrestling with something a little… prickly in my C programming lately. I’m dipping my toes into macros for variable declaration – you know, the preprocessor magic – and it’s throwing me for a loop. It feels like a shortcut, a way to shave off a few lines of code, but at what cost? 

Honestly, staring at a wall of `#define` statements makes my brain hurt a little. In 2020, with all the emphasis on clean, readable code, it feels almost… rebellious. I keep thinking about how much easier it would be to just use a standard `int myVariable;` – and frankly, it *is* easier to understand. 

I’m really trying to balance the perceived efficiency with the long-term goal of maintainable code.  I’m posting this here, hoping someone else has navigated this tightrope before me.  What’s your take on macros? Do you find they're a valuable tool, or do you stick to the basics?
