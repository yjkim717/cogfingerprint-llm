**Is My Scroll a Stage?**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020. We were all glued to screens, desperately seeking connection in a world that felt increasingly…distant. And lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about this strange feeling – like I’m watching a play, a really elaborate, personalized one. 

It reminds me of Ligotti, that unsettling philosopher who talked about humanity as puppets, deliberately constructing an illusion to shield ourselves from the raw, uncomfortable truth of existence.  Does endlessly scrolling through Instagram, chasing likes and validation, feel a little like that? Are we building a beautiful, shimmering facade to avoid confronting the quiet ache of being?

I’m not saying it’s inherently bad – connection *is* important. But I wonder if we’re so busy crafting this perfect digital self, this curated highlight reel, that we’ve forgotten to actually *feel* anything real.  Maybe, just maybe, we’re all a little bit of a puppet, dancing to the tune of an algorithm.  It’s a thought that keeps me up at night, scrolling through the darkness.
