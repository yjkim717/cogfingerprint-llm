As I sat in my small Berlin apartment in 2020, surrounded by laptops and empty coffee cups, I couldn't help but think about the role technology played in my life as a medical student. The COVID-19 pandemic had just started, and the world was rapidly changing. I was one of many students who had to adapt to online learning, navigating virtual classrooms and digital tools to continue my studies. At first, it was tough - I missed the camaraderie of being in a physical classroom with my peers. But as time passed, I discovered the flexibility and accessibility that technology offered. I could attend lectures from anywhere, revisit recordings, and connect with fellow students across the globe. It was a challenging time, but technology became my trusted companion, enabling me to pursue my medical degree despite the chaos around me.
