It’s funny how priorities shift. Back in early 2020, I was so excited to build my first streaming rig, carefully choosing the Ryzen 5 1600AF and the compact MSI B450I motherboard. For a few months, it was my command center for gaming and late-night streams.

But life, as it often does, had other plans. Grad school applications came calling, and with them, those daunting fees. So here I am, listing this little powerhouse for sale. It’s more than just a used motherboard and CPU; it’s a bundle of what-ifs and late-night memories. Letting it go is bittersweet, but it’s fueling a different kind of dream now. Sometimes, the right upgrade isn't for your PC, but for your future.
