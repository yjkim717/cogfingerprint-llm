It’s 2020, and I’m sitting at my laptop, staring at a spreadsheet of internship applications. Journalism and publishing have always been the dream, but in a world that’s suddenly remote and fiercely competitive, I feel like I’m racing with one foot stuck in the past. No college internships, no newsroom hustle—just me, my Wi-Fi, and a whole lot of self-doubt.

Then I landed a digital content internship. Suddenly, I wasn’t just applying—I was doing. I learned SEO, edited virtual pieces, and even helped coordinate a remote publishing schedule. It wasn’t the gritty news floor I’d imagined, but it taught me something crucial: adaptability is the new byline.

Now, I’m chasing every online workshop and networking on LinkedIn like it’s my second job. The path isn’t traditional, but maybe that’s the point. In a tech-driven world, building your career is less about where you’ve been and more about how creatively you can move forward. And me? I’m just getting started.
