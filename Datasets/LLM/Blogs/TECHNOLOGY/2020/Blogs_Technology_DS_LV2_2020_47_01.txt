It’s 2020, and I’m staring at my phone, feeling a familiar dread. Every notification buzzes like a loose tile in my mind—another news alert, another grim update. My digital world, once seamless, now has wet grout lines of anxiety seeping through.

I remember when tech felt like a freshly caulked bathtub: smooth, contained, reliable. But this year? It’s all water damage behind the screen. Endless scrolling leaves me waterlogged with worry, the foundations of my attention crumbling.

So I’ve started small: muting apps, carving out quiet hours. It’s my way of patching the leaks, reclaiming a bit of peace in a flood of information. Sometimes, the simplest fixes protect what matters most.
