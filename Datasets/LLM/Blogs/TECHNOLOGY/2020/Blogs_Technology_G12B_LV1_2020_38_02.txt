## The Algorithm Knows More Than I Thought (And That's Okay?)

It’s 2020. Need I say more? The world feels…shifted. And honestly, so does my career path. I graduated last spring with a Philosophy and English degree – a classic "what are you going to *do* with that?" combination. I’d always envisioned a path into publishing, maybe journalism, but the internships? They just didn't happen. Life, you know?

Then came the lockdown, and suddenly *everything* was online. I started tinkering with SEO, just out of boredom, trying to understand how articles rose to the top of Google. It was fascinating, and a little intimidating. I realized the algorithms practically *are* the gatekeepers now.  Forget charming editors over coffee – you need to understand how to speak the language of search.

It felt… impersonal.  Like the human element, the passion for storytelling I’d nurtured for years, was being swallowed by lines of code. But then, I started seeing the potential.  I could *learn* this language. I could use it to amplify voices, to connect people with stories they’d never find otherwise.

Maybe a traditional publishing route isn’t the only way. Maybe the "career path" I imagined back in college is already evolving, shaped by these very technologies. It's daunting, sure, but also strangely exciting.  I'm not sure where I'll end up, but I'm finally feeling a sense of purpose again - learning to navigate this new digital landscape, and finding my place within it. And who knows, maybe the algorithm will notice me after all.
