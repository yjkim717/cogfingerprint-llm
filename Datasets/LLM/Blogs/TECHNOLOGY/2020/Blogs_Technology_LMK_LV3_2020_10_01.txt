As I navigated the UBC campus in 2020, I realized that commuting to grad school wasn't just about getting to class on time. With limited parking options and a lengthy waitlist, I turned to alternative transportation methods. Embracing technology, I discovered route-optimizing apps and real-time transit updates made my daily commute smoother. It was a small win, but it made all the difference in my grad school journey, allowing me to focus on my research rather than circling the parking lot.
