**The Ghosts in the Machine**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we pour billions into building things – massive weapon systems, complex software – and then watch them stumble through development, years behind schedule and way over budget. I was reading some stuff about the US military’s acquisition process the other day, and it felt like a recurring nightmare. 

Apparently, there’s a serious lack of proper oversight, a reliance on outdated budgeting models, and projects like Raytheon’s OCX just…stalling. It’s not about the technology itself, though that’s impressive. It's about the *process* of getting it to where it needs to be. 

It makes you wonder about the value of all this investment. Are we prioritizing speed and innovation, or just chasing the biggest number?  2020 felt like a year of huge leaps in tech, but seeing this kind of systemic inefficiency in defense… it’s a sobering reminder that even the most advanced tools need a solid foundation, and a watchful eye.  What do you think?
