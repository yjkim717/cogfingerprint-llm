>## The Algorithm and My Patience: A Digital Disconnect

Remember 2020? We were all glued to screens, navigating a world that felt increasingly… digital. I found myself wrestling with a frustrating parallel to a problem many cat owners face: a disconnect. My social media feed, meticulously curated by algorithms, felt less like connection and more like a carefully constructed echo chamber. 

I kept trying to “relocate” my expectations – hoping a different filter, a new platform, would bring something fresh. But the core issue remained: a sense of manufactured relevance. It made me wonder, are we truly connecting, or just being efficiently served what we already believe? It's a reminder that sometimes, stepping away from the digital box is the best way to find something real.
