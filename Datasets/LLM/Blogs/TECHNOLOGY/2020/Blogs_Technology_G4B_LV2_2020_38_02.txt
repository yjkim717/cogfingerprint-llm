**The Scroll and the Silence: When Tech Feels Like a Dead End**

Okay, let’s be real. 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic and, you know, *everything*, navigating a career felt like wading through mud. I was staring at my laptop screen, desperately trying to build a portfolio in digital marketing – a field I was genuinely excited about – and feeling utterly lost.

I kept seeing these amazing people, seemingly effortlessly landing jobs, and I started to question myself. It felt like everyone else had a secret roadmap, a carefully curated collection of internships and projects. I’d spent the last few months building a basic website and tweaking my LinkedIn, but it still felt…quiet. Like a scroll filled with beautiful images but no actual story.

I realized I was fixating on the “perfect” experience – the fancy internship at a huge agency. But in 2020, those were practically non-existent.  I started volunteering for a local non-profit, helping them with their social media. It wasn’t glamorous, but it *was* something. It was a chance to actually *do* and build a portfolio organically. 

Suddenly, the silence of my screen started to feel a little less daunting.  Maybe the path isn't about chasing the ideal, but about building your own way, one small step at a time.
