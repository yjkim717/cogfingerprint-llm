**The Algorithm and the Feeling of Missing Out**

Remember 2020? It felt like *everything* was happening online. We were all glued to screens, desperate for connection and, let’s be honest, a distraction from the chaos. And that’s where the weird feeling started for me – with games like Destiny 2. 

I loved the Mythoclast, that exotic weapon with its crazy build possibilities. But lately, it felt less like a reward and more like a frustrating chase. Bungie’s systems, designed to keep us hooked, sometimes felt like they were deliberately making it *hard* to get what you wanted. 

It’s a strange thing, isn’t it? We build these digital worlds, invest so much time, and yet the algorithms can feel…uncaring. Like you’re constantly just *almost* there. It made me think about how much we crave genuine reward, not just the next shiny thing.
