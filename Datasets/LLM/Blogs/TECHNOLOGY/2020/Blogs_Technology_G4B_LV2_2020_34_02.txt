**The Weight of a Good Thing**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we get so caught up in the *stuff* of life. Last year, I was staring down a decision about a Yoder YS640 pellet grill – a beautiful, beast of a machine.  The shipping cost was eye-watering, and then there was the thought of a two-hour drive to pick it up from a local dealer. 

Suddenly, it wasn’t just about grilling; it was about the *effort*.  It made me think about all the tech we buy – the latest phone, the smart speaker – and how easily we forget the value of a simpler choice. Sometimes, the best technology is just… nearby.  It’s a reminder that convenience isn’t always the answer.
