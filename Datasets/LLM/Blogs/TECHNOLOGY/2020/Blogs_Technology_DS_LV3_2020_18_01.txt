It was early 2020, and our world was rapidly shifting to remote work. I remember the frantic call from a client: "We have Office 365 E3, but can we restrict access to company data by country?" They were worried about security in this new, borderless work environment.

We dove into the licensing details together. The heart of the issue was geo-fencing through Conditional Accessâ€”a powerful feature, but one that required Azure AD P1 licenses. It was a classic case of the right tool for the job, but needing the right key to unlock it. That moment crystallized a new reality: in our distributed world, security isn't just about passwords; it's about building digital fences with the proper legal and licensing foundations. A necessary evolution, indeed.
