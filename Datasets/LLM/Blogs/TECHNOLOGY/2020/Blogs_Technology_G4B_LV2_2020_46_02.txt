**The Alert Avalanche: Taming SCOM in 2020**

Let’s be honest, remember 2020? It felt like a constant barrage of notifications – Zoom calls, news alerts, and, for IT pros, a *serious* influx of alerts from SCOM (System Center Operations Manager) for Exchange 2016. Seriously, my dashboard looked like a Jackson Pollock painting of red warnings.

I was drowning in redundant alerts, each one screaming about a similar issue. It was exhausting, and frankly, a lot of them were just noise. That's when I started digging into streamlining our monitoring. 

We focused on creating Health Sets – grouping related alerts – and really honing in on what *actually* mattered.  Then came the hunt for alert consolidation – pulling those duplicate notifications into one, clear message.  Finally, learning to strategically use SCOM overrides helped us prioritize the critical issues. 

It wasn't magic, but it was a huge relief.  It's a constant balancing act, but learning to manage the noise in SCOM ultimately freed up time to actually *solve* problems, instead of just reacting to them.  What are your best SCOM tips?
