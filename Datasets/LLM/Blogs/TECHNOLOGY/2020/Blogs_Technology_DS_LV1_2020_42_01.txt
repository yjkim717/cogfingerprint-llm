It’s 2020, and I’m trying to build a website that respects visitors’ privacy while still understanding how they use it. GDPR looms large in my mind—every decision feels like walking a tightrope. Can I mask IP addresses but still get a general sense of location? How accurate is too accurate when collecting data? I want to know when someone visits, but I don’t need to know their every digital footstep. It’s a balancing act: creating a functional, insightful analytics setup without crossing ethical lines. In the end, it’s about building trust, one careful choice at a time.
