**Lost in Translation: Dreaming of German Medicine in a Digital World**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… uncertain. I was spending hours researching a completely different dream – studying medicine in Germany. Specifically, a Brazilian student, just like me, was reaching out, worried about the mountain of paperwork involved in transferring credits with a foreign diploma. It really hit home. 

The internet promised connection, making this seemingly impossible goal feel *almost* within reach. I spent days poring over university websites, wrestling with the cost of living in cities like Berlin, and trying to decipher German academic regulations. It felt overwhelming, like trying to assemble a complicated piece of tech without the manual. 

Honestly, the sheer volume of information, coupled with the logistical hurdles – like the acceptance of my Brazilian medical degree – felt like a massive, digital wall.  But the desire to learn, to contribute, to truly understand the human body, kept me going.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest challenges are less about the destination and more about navigating the path to get there.
