It’s funny how a single question can make you rethink everything you thought you knew. My partner, a dedicated dental hygienist, came home one evening last year looking unusually pensive. "Do you ever worry about my exposure to x-rays?" she asked. It was 2020—we were already grappling with so much uncertainty, and now this.

Her clinic had just upgraded to digital imaging, praised for its precision and lower radiation. But she’d noticed how often the thyroid collar was set aside in the rush of a packed schedule. Colleagues joked about "toughness," but she couldn’t shake the nagging fear: years of occupational exposure, the whispers of cancer risk. Was their vigilance slipping in the face of routine?

Technology in dentistry has come so far, promising safety and efficiency. Yet it’s a stark reminder that the human element—our habits, our haste—can undermine even the best tools. That conversation wasn’t just about x-rays; it was about the quiet compromises we make, and the courage it takes to question them, even when everyone else seems fine.
