It’s 2020, and I’m sitting at my makeshift home office, staring at a screen full of code. I’ve been trying to debug a stubborn piece of software for hours, and I keep thinking about how certain words—like the pronouns in Czech or Malayalam—can evolve from being separate, movable elements into inseparable parts of a sentence. It’s called grammaticalization, and linguists debate whether it’s a form of "incorporation." Honestly, it reminds me of how technology has woven itself into our lives.

Think about it: just a decade ago, our phones were tools we picked up and put down. Now, they’re practically extensions of our hands—always there, always connected. Like those Czech clitics that fused into words, our devices have become inseparable from our daily routines. We don’t just use technology; we live with it, in it.

In Malayalam, some pronouns have undergone a similar journey, losing their independence to become part of a larger structure. It’s a quiet, gradual shift—one you might not notice until it’s complete. Sound familiar? That’s how apps and algorithms have slipped into the background of our lives, shaping how we communicate, work, and even think.

As I finally fix that bug, I can’t help but reflect: maybe we’re in the middle of our own kind of incorporation. Our tools aren’t just tools anymore; they’re part of who we are. And just like linguists question when a clitic becomes something more, I wonder—when did our relationship with tech become so deeply embedded? In 2020, more than ever, it feels like we’re living the answer.
