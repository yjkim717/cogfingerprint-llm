## The Unexpected Comfort of Disconnecting

Remember 2020? The world felt… a lot. For me, it was a blur of news alerts and endless scrolling. Then, I stumbled back into *Stardew Valley*. Seriously. Tending pixelated crops and gifting virtual chickens felt surprisingly grounding. 

It made me realize how much I'd let technology dictate my pace. The constant notifications, the pressure to *always be on*… it was exhausting. Now, I actively schedule tech-free evenings. It’s not about rejecting progress, but remembering the quiet joy of just *being*, whether it’s watering virtual parsnips or, you know, actually noticing the sunset. Small shifts, big impact.



Hope this captures the vibe you were going for! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
