**The Moment I Almost Left Shopify**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a little thing – a frustrating limitation – can make you seriously question everything. Back in 2020, I was really invested in my Shopify store. It felt…easy. But then I started noticing a pattern: brilliant customers from all over Europe were hitting a wall at checkout. The lack of a proper multicurrency option was killing our conversion rate. 

Honestly, there was a moment I seriously considered jumping ship and going back to WooCommerce. It felt like a huge step, a surrender to complexity, but the thought of letting those international customers slip away was just…unacceptable. It forced me to really think about the user experience and push Shopify for change.  It’s a reminder that even the ‘easiest’ tools can have hidden roadblocks.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
