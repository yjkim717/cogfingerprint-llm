## Are We Building Our Own Boxes? (And Why That Might Be Okay)

It's 2020, and we're *all* online. Constantly connected, scrolling, consuming. Lately, I've been thinking about this obsession, and it’s led me down a weird rabbit hole – specifically, the philosophy of Thomas Ligotti. He proposes a chilling idea: that we're puppets, unknowingly limiting our consciousness to cope with the overwhelming reality of existence. 

Sounds dramatic, right? But hear me out. Aren't we, in a way, doing the same with technology? Curating our feeds, filtering out the noise, building these digital boxes that feel safe, familiar… but also undeniably *limited*. Are we using technology to enhance our understanding, or simply to shield ourselves from something we're not ready to face? Maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing. Maybe sometimes, a little manufactured comfort is exactly what we need.
