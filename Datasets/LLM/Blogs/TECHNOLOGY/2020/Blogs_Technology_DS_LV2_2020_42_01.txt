It’s 2020, and I’m staring at my analytics dashboard, feeling a bit like a digital detective who’s lost their magnifying glass. GDPR has me second-guessing every click and query—how do I respect privacy without flying blind? I remember the days of tracking every IP address, but now it’s all about masking and minimizing. Sure, my location data is fuzzier, but there’s a strange peace in knowing I’m not overstepping. It’s a delicate dance between insight and intrusion, and honestly, I’m learning to appreciate the boundaries. After all, trust is the real metric that matters.
