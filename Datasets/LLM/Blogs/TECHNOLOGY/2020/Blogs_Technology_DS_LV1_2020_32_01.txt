### The Ghost in the Machine: A 2020 DNS Tale

It was the spring of 2020, and our world had already turned upside down. With the entire company working remotely, our Exchange server wasn't just a piece of hardware; it was our digital heartbeat, our central nervous system. So, when the "undeliverable" reports started trickling in, a quiet dread set in. It wasn't a complete outage, just a mysterious, intermittent failure. Crucial emails to partners were vanishing into the ether, stuck in a perpetual "queue retry" state.

My initial panic led me down the usual rabbit holes. I checked the mailbox databases, scrutinized the transport services, and ran every diagnostic I could think of. The logs were cryptic, pointing to a "DNS query failed." But we could ping Google, we could browse the web—our DNS seemed fine, right?

The breakthrough came when I looked closer at the network adapter. There it was, almost hiding in plain sight: an IPv6 address, configured but not truly in use by our internal network. In the quiet chaos of a world adapting to lockdowns, our server was patiently trying to resolve external domains over IPv6, getting no response, and then… giving up. It wasn't even trying the reliable IPv4 path.

The fix was almost embarrassingly simple. I disabled the IPv6 query preference on the Exchange server, gave the transport services a quick restart, and watched as the queue of stalled emails evaporated. It was a humbling reminder that in our complex digital ecosystems, the smallest, most overlooked setting—a ghost protocol from a future not yet fully realized—can bring critical communication to its knees. In a year of monumental challenges, it was a tiny configuration that taught me a big lesson about resilience.
