**The Great Zoom Internship Panic of 2020**

It was during a breakout room in my Data Structures lecture that the panic truly set in. My classmate, let’s call him “Kevin,” was casually mentioning his upcoming final-round interview for a summer internship. My screen froze for a second—or maybe that was just my brain. A freshman? An internship? In this economy?

Here I was, a CS newbie in 2020, just trying to remember the difference between a linked list and an array from my childhood bedroom. My resume felt like a blank Microsoft Word document next to the polished PDFs I imagined everyone else had. While the world was on pause, it felt like the tech race was speeding up without me on the track.

But this strange, isolated year taught me something crucial. My journey isn't Kevin's journey. My focus now isn't on landing a fancy internship; it's on building. Building my skills, one online tutorial at a time. Building a simple project, even if it's buggy. The interviews will come, but the foundation has to be laid first, quietly, from right here at my desk.
