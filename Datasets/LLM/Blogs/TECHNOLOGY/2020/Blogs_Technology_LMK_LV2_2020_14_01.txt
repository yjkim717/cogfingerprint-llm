As I hooked up my retro gaming rig to that old CRT TV, I couldn't help but wonder - does using RetroArch on a vintage TV truly capture the essence of retro gaming? I fired up Lakka and started playing classic consoles, and was transported back to lazy afternoons spent gaming on the original hardware. The nostalgia was palpable, but was it authentic? As I played, I realized that RetroArch on a CRT TV isn't just about nostalgia - it's about reliving the experience, with a dash of modern convenience. It's retro gaming, reimagined.
