>## The Scroll and the Summer: Finding Connection in a Disconnected Year

Remember 2020? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? The summer stretched out, a vast, uncertain landscape. For many of us, the usual summer plans – internships, travel, those coveted college programs – vanished with a swipe of a finger, another cancelled event notification popping up on our phones. I felt it too. That sting of missed opportunities, the pressure of building a college application in a year where "normal" was a distant memory.

Instead of chasing the traditional route, I dove deeper into online communities. Forums, virtual workshops, even just connecting with people on social media sparked unexpected conversations and collaborations. It wasn't the summer I envisioned, but it taught me a powerful lesson: connection can be found in unexpected places, even within the glow of a screen. And sometimes, that's enough.
