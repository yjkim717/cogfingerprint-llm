## The Unexpected Calm of Disconnecting

Remember 2020? The world felt perpetually online. Zoom calls blurred into endless news cycles, and my phone felt like an extension of my hand. I was applying to grad school, researching UBC in Vancouver, and the whole process felt… frantic. Public transit from my place in Oakridge felt brutal – a serious time commitment. Driving seemed easier, but then I’d spend half my day stressing about Vancouver parking! 

It got me thinking: are we *really* more connected when we're glued to our screens? I started intentionally scheduling “offline” blocks. Just an hour, sometimes. Suddenly, the commute felt less like a chore and more like a chance to breathe. To actually *see* Vancouver. It’s a small thing, but disconnecting helped me refocus, and honestly, made the whole application process feel a little less overwhelming.
