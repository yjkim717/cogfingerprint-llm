It was March 2020, and our team was scrambling to go fully remote. As the Office 365 admin, I felt confidentâ€”until I hit a wall in Microsoft Stream. My permissions were correct, but the "Create live event" button just wouldn't appear. Had Microsoft removed it in a Teams update, or was this just a frustrating delay? In a year defined by digital connection, that one missing feature felt like a monumental roadblock, leaving me questioning the very tools meant to bring us together.
