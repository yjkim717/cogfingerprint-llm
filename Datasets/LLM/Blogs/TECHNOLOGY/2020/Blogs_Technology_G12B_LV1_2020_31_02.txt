>## The Great JS File Consolidation of '20

Okay, so I was wrestling with a website project last week, and it hit me just how messy JavaScript can get. We’re all encouraged to modularize, to break things down into smaller, reusable chunks. Which is great, in theory! But suddenly you've got a dozen `.js` files, each importing bits and pieces from others, and your HTML head is overflowing with `<script>` tags. It just…felt clunky.

I decided to tackle the problem head-on and consolidate everything into a single file. It felt a little retro, honestly, bringing back memories of monolithic JavaScript files from the early 2000s. But using a bundler – Webpack, in this case – made the process surprisingly smooth. It pulled in all the dependencies, minimized the code, and spat out a single, optimized file.

The result? A cleaner HTML, faster page load times, and a generally more organized project. Sometimes, taking a step back and simplifying things is the ultimate efficiency hack. Anyone else been on a similar decluttering journey lately?
