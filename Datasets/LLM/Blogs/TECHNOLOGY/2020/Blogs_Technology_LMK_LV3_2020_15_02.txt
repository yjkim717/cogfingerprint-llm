As I reflected on my Skyrim journey in 2020, I realized my preference for melee builds over stealth archers says a lot about my gaming personality. I crave the rush of close combat, the strategy, and the connection with the game world. In a year dominated by remote interactions, I found solace in the immersive, in-your-face nature of melee gaming, and it has made me appreciate the value of hands-on experiences in a digital age.
