"As we dive into 2024, the AI landscape is more exciting than ever. That's why I'm thrilled to share that we're open-sourcing our managed API gateway and client libraries for AI services, built with Kotlin. This move is all about fostering collaboration and driving innovation. By making our tools available to the community, we hope to accelerate the development of AI-powered applications. We're eager to hear your thoughts and feedback, and invite you to contribute to our project. Let's work together to shape the future of AI - join the conversation and help us build something amazing!"
