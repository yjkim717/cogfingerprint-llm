There’s something about a fresh gaming rig in 2024 that makes you want to revisit old favorites. I’m diving back into the Commonwealth in Fallout 4, but this time, I’m rethinking my mod strategy. For years, I relied on the Unofficial Patch as a one-stop fix, but it’s a bit of a blunt instrument. Now, I’m hunting for specific bug-fix mods tailored to the exact issues that irk me. It’s a more personal approach to curating my perfect, post-apocalyptic playground. Sometimes, less really is more.
