**The Day My Cursor Vanished (and ChromeOS Flex Gave Me a Headache)**

It’s funny how technology can throw you for a loop, right? Just last week, I was happily cruising through my ChromeOS Flex – using it as a surprisingly capable laptop from Fujitsu – when suddenly, my cursor just… disappeared. Poof! Gone after closing the lid.
