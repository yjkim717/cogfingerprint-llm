## The Stats & CS Juggling Act (and Why It's Kinda Terrifying)

Okay, real talk. Anyone else feeling the pressure of ambitious academic goals? I’m a Berkeley CS student, and I’m staring down the barrel of five semesters to tackle nine statistics courses *plus* my core CS requirements *and* those pesky breadth requirements. Letter grades for both majors? Don't even get me started.

It’s exhilarating, wanting to dive deep into both fields, but also…a little terrifying. It feels like a constant calculation: can I *really* absorb all this? Anyone else out there navigating a similarly intense double major? Share your wisdom – I'm clearly going to need it!
