Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your request.

It hit me last week, scrolling through a "Year in Review" slideshow my phone auto-generated. There I was, beaming in dozens of photos—except I was completely alone. The algorithm had perfectly curated a highlight reel of my 2024, but every "memory" was a screenshot of a triumphant win in a multiplayer game or a selfie I’d taken after a long video call.

My smartwatch buzzes with notifications, my feeds are constantly updated, and my follower count is healthy. By all our modern metrics, I am socially successful. Yet, I’ve started to feel like a digital spare ticket. I’m a reliable +1 for an online raid or a quick DM, but when the server goes quiet, so does the connection. The technology designed to bring us together has, in my case, brilliantly automated the feeling of being a background character in everyone else’s story. It’s a strange, silent isolation, dressed up in the flashing lights of constant connection.
