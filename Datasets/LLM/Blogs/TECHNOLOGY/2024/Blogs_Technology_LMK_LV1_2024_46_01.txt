The joys of being an IT admin in 2024. You'd think that with all the advancements in technology, managing a company's tech infrastructure would be a breeze. But, as I've learned, it's not just about keeping the servers running and the Wi-Fi connected. It's about dealing with people - and sometimes, that's the toughest challenge of all.

I recently had to deal with a new sales admin assistant who was, to put it mildly, a handful. She was hired to support our sales department, but it quickly became apparent that she had no idea how to use the tools we had in place. I'm talking basic email and file server navigation - stuff that most people pick up in a day or two. But not her. She managed to get herself locked out of her email account not once, not twice, but multiple times. And when I had to reset her password (again), she'd get frustrated and call me, demanding to know why she couldn't just "remember" her password.

But that was just the tip of the iceberg. She'd also save files to her local desktop instead of the shared drive, causing all sorts of version control issues. And when I tried to explain to her how to use Shadow Copy to recover a previous version of a file, she looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. It was like she was allergic to reading documentation or following instructions.

The final straw came when she sent a nasty email to the entire sales team, complaining about how "incompetent" our IT department was. Um, hello? You're the one who's been causing all the issues! I had to have a word with her manager, and let's just say it didn't end well for her.

In the end, it was clear that she wasn't a good fit for our team. But it made me realize that, as IT admins, we're not just responsible for keeping the tech running - we're also teachers, mentors, and (sometimes) referees. We've got to be patient, communicate clearly, and sometimes, we've got to make tough calls. It's not always easy, but it's all part of the job. And hey, at least it makes for a good story.
