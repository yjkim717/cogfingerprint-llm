Remember that frantic weekend I spent wrestling with Plesk’s licensing fees? I was setting up my LNMP stack on Ubuntu, craving a simple, free control panel. It felt like being handed a locked toolbox for a simple DIY project.

That hunt for a Plesk alternative wasn't just about saving money; it was about control. I wanted to manage virtual hosts and PHP versions without corporate strings. Finding that perfect, intuitive solution felt like a small victory in 2024's complex digital landscape—a reminder that powerful tools should empower, not hinder, our passion projects.
