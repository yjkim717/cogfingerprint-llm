**The Scroll and the Silence**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we build walls these days, even when we’re desperately seeking connection. I’ve been wrestling with this lately, and it feels oddly linked to the endless scroll. 

I’m 31, and I’ve noticed a creeping aversion to…well, everything really. Specifically, intimacy. It’s not that I *don’t* feel desire – I do! – but the thought of truly opening up, of showing my vulnerable self, feels terrifying. 

There’s a strange comfort in crafting a persona online, a curated version of myself that feels safer. It’s a digital shield, and honestly, sometimes it feels *necessary*. But lately, I’m realizing it’s also building a wall between me and real connection. 

I’m starting to think we’re trading genuine vulnerability for the fleeting validation of a like. Maybe it’s time to put down the phone and find a quieter space to just *be*.  What about you? Are you feeling this pull too?
