>## The Algorithm and the Empty Chair

It's strange how technology, something so often lauded for connection, can highlight absence. My dad’s been battling lung and throat cancer for a while now, and lately, the reliance on machines has been… stark. The feeding tube, the oxygen concentrator humming in the corner, even the app tracking his medication – they're all essential, undeniably. 

But looking at him, frail in his chair, surrounded by these technological life-supports, I feel a disconnect. We video call my sister across the country, sharing updates, a digital bridge spanning the miles. Yet, the screen feels cold compared to the warmth of a hand squeeze. 

2024, the year of personalized AI and seamless connectivity, and I'm longing for a simpler time, a time when presence felt more tangible, less mediated. It makes you think, doesn’t it? About what we’re truly connecting to, and what we might be losing along the way.
