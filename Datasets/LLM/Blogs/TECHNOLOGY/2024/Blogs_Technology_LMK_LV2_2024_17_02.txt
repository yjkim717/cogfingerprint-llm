**Embracing Simplicity: My Journey to a Streamlined WordPress Setup**

As I stood at the threshold of setting up my new VPS in early 2024, I found myself pondering the age-old question: "What's the best way to host my WordPress sites?" With the ever-expanding universe of tech options, the decision felt daunting. I narrowed down my choices to three paths: using Docker for a containerized setup, installing WordPress directly on my server, or simplifying the process with a control panel.

The Docker route promised isolation and ease of management across multiple sites, but it also introduced an additional layer of complexity. Direct installation, on the other hand, offered a straightforward, no-frills approach, but I worried about the potential for configuration headaches down the line. Then there were control panels like cPanel or Plesk, which touted ease of use but came with a cost and, in my view, a somewhat bloated feature set.

As I weighed these options, I realized my true desire was for a setup that was both simple and flexible. After some experimentation, I leaned towards a self-hosted WordPress setup using Nginx. This path allowed me to avoid the overhead of Docker while maintaining a high degree of control over my server configuration. By directly installing WordPress and configuring Nginx, I achieved a lean, efficient hosting environment that met my needs without unnecessary complexity.

My journey taught me that sometimes, the best tech solutions are those that strike a balance between power and simplicity. For me, a self-hosted WordPress site with Nginx on a VPS is that sweet spot, offering both the flexibility I crave and the ease of management I need to focus on what truly matters â€“ creating content that resonates.
