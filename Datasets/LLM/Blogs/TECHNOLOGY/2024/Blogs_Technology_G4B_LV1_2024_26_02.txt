**The Ghost of an ITX Build**

It’s funny how digital things stick with you. I recently helped a friend sell off some of his old PC parts, and he had this RX 5600 graphics card lingering. It was part of an ambitious ITX build he’d started – all sleek and compact, never quite finished. 

He’d paired it with a surprisingly hefty 3x fan cooler, clearly aiming for serious cooling.  I remember him excitedly talking about it, a little dream of smooth gaming. Now, it’s moving on to a new home. Sometimes, the most interesting tech isn’t the finished product, but the ideas behind it.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps add a specific detail or adjust the tone?
