## The Algorithm Knows I'm Tired (and Probably Needs a Date Night)

It's 2024, and the algorithms *know*. They know I’m a San Antonio mom of three little ones, perpetually juggling bedtime routines and dinner prep. They know I was just online, desperately searching for date night ideas – something special for an anniversary, maybe a nice dinner in Stone Oak. 

Honestly, I was just looking for a little spark, a reminder of life before tiny humans demanded all my attention. Then I posted on Reddit, hoping for suggestions, and… the negativity surprised me. It got me thinking: are we all so wrapped up in our own online bubbles that we forget simple connection and empathy? Maybe the algorithm *does* know I'm tired, but it doesn’t understand the need for a little romance and a break.
