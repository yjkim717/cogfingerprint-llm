It’s 2024, and my phone is buzzing—another last-minute invite from a friend I’ve known for years. At first, it felt spontaneous and fun. But lately, I’ve noticed a pattern: I’m the backup plan, the plus-one when someone else cancels, the filler for an empty seat.

We’ve shared countless dinners and concerts, but the conversations stay surface-level, lost between notifications and group chats. I scroll through our messages, seeing a timeline of transactional outings—"Got an extra ticket," "Join us last minute?"—but few moments of real connection. In a world where technology promises to bring us closer, why do I feel lonelier than ever?

I’m not asking for grand gestures, just genuine presence. A voice note asking how I’m really doing, or a video call where we laugh without distractions. True friendship shouldn’t be about convenience; it’s about communication that bridges the distance, not just fills the silence. Maybe it’s time to stop being so available and start seeking the connections that truly matter.
