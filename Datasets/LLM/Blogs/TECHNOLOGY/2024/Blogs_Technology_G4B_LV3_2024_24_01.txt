**The Ghost in the Machine: When Muscle Memory Betrays You**

Okay, let’s be real – 2024 feels like a constant battle against the future. We’re supposed to be *optimizing* everything, right? And in CS2, that optimization is all about the subtick. I used to just…react. Years of ingrained muscle memory, honed through countless hours on the Dust2 server, just *knew* where the enemy would be.
