## Fresh Hardware, Familiar Obsessions: Diving Back into the Wasteland

So, I finally bit the bullet and upgraded my rig. New GPU, more RAM – the whole shebang. Naturally, my first thought wasn't spreadsheets or video editing; it was *Fallout 4*. There's just something about that post-apocalyptic Boston that keeps pulling me back.

But, like any seasoned Bethesda fan, I know the base game isn't exactly pristine. That's why I'm cautiously approaching this new playthrough, opting for a curated selection of individual bug-fixing mods instead of the massive Unofficial Patch. I’m hoping to fine-tune the experience, squeeze every last drop of performance out of my new hardware, and avoid any potential conflicts. It’s a familiar ritual, really – tweaking, optimizing, and chasing that perfect Fallout immersion. Anyone else feel that obsessive joy?
