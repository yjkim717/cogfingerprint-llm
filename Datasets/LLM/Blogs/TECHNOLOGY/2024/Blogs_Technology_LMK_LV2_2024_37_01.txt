The perpetual regex puzzle! I still recall scratching my head over `/^\\s+$/g` in 2024, wondering why it didn't trim my strings as expected. It wasn't until I dug deeper that I realized the `^` and `$` anchors were matching line breaks, not just the entire string. A simple `str.trim()` would've done the trick, but the regex rabbit hole was too enticing. Lesson learned: sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most elegant.
