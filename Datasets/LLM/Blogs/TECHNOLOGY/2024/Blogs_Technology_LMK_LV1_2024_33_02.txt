"Wildcard Woes: My Journey with Certbot, DuckDNS, and Let's Encrypt"

As I sat in front of my Ubuntu 22.04 server in early 2024, I was determined to secure my domain with a wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate. I'd heard great things about Certbot, so I decided to give it a shot. My domain was hosted on DuckDNS, which added an extra layer of complexity to the process.

My initial attempts were met with frustration. Certbot's documentation seemed to assume a more straightforward setup, and I struggled to adapt the instructions to my DuckDNS configuration. I poured over online forums and tutorials, but every solution I tried ended in error messages and dead ends.

After hours of trial and error, I finally stumbled upon a working configuration. It turned out that the key was to use Certbot's DNS plugin, which allowed me to authenticate with DuckDNS using their API. I also had to tweak my Nginx configuration to play nice with the newly obtained certificate.

As I looked back on the experience, I realized that the struggle was worth it. Not only did I gain a deeper understanding of the technologies involved, but I also appreciated the sense of accomplishment that came with overcoming the obstacles. My Nginx server was now proudly serving up content with a shiny new wildcard certificate, courtesy of Let's Encrypt and Certbot.

If you're facing similar challenges, take heart: with persistence and patience, you too can tame the Certbot-DuckDNS-Let's Encrypt beast. Just be prepared to get your hands dirty and dig into the documentation â€“ it's worth it in the end.
