## Remember When "Being Online" Felt…New?

It’s funny, isn’t it? How seamlessly technology has woven itself into the fabric of our days. I was just scrolling through old photos – remember the awkward selfies with the front-facing camera being a *thing*? – and it hit me: being constantly online used to feel…novel. Exciting, even.

Now, it's just *how* we exist. A constant hum of notifications, a relentless stream of information. I find myself craving moments of genuine disconnect, of just *being* without the pressure to document or share.  It’s not that technology is bad, but maybe we need to consciously carve out space for the offline, for the quiet moments that don't need a filter.  Anyone else feel that tug sometimes?
