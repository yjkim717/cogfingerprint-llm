**Leveling Up: When Next.js Meets the Backend**

It’s 2024, and I’m constantly wrestling with the “fullstack” question. We’re building *everything* with JavaScript, and Next.js is increasingly tempting for handling backend logic. Honestly, the idea of keeping server-side components close to the front-end feels incredibly streamlined. 

But I’ve been digging deeper, and it’s not quite as simple as swapping out old code. There's a real conversation to be had around scalability – can Next.js *really* handle a massive user base? And what about monitoring?  Suddenly, “easy” feels less about the framework and more about the infrastructure supporting it. 

It’s a fascinating challenge, and one that’s pushing me to think critically about the tradeoffs of these shiny new tools.  Are we building for speed, or building for sustainable growth?
