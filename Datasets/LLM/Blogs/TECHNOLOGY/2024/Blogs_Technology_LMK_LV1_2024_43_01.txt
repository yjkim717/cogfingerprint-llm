As I dive into building full-stack applications in 2024, I'm torn about where to house my business logic. NextJS, with its robust server-side capabilities, is tempting me to merge database operations and business rules directly into frontend components. But is this a scalable path forward? I'm considering the pros and cons. On one hand, it simplifies development; on the other, it blurs the lines between presentation and logic. I'd love to hear from others: are we heading towards a future where server-side React frameworks like NextJS become the one-stop-shop for both frontend and backend logic?
