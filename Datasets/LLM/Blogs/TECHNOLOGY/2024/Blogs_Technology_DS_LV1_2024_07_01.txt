### The Algorithm Isn't Everything: Finding Our Brand's True Voice

Remember when marketing felt like a simple conversation? For a while, ours became a monologue shouted into the Facebook void. Don't get me wrongâ€”the ads worked. They brought us our first loyal customers, the kind who now know our sustainable stitches by heart.

But 2024 has been a wake-up call. Relying on a single algorithm feels like building a house on rented land. We realized that true growth isn't just about repeat buyers; it's about becoming a name people seek out. We want to be the answer to "Where can I find a truly sustainable t-shirt?" not just another post in a crowded feed.

So, we're shifting gears. We're diving into heartfelt email stories, partnering with influencers who genuinely live our values, and creating content that we hope will make you type our name directly into that search bar. It's less about chasing trends and more about planting a garden we can tend to for years to come. The goal? For our brand to be discovered, not just delivered.
