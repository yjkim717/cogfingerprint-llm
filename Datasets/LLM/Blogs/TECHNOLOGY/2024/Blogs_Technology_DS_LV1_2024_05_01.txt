### The Unreliable Road: My Quest for a Decent Bus from NYC to Ithaca

I’ve become a reluctant expert on the I-88 corridor, all thanks to my attempts to get from New York City to Ithaca. You’d think with options like Megabus, Flix, OurBus, and the old-school Trailways, one would be reliable. My personal data, however, tells a different story.

Out of my last ten trips, a staggering five have been marred by significant issues. A Flix bus cancellation left me stranded at the Port Authority at midnight. A Megabus "delay" turned a four-hour journey into an eight-hour ordeal. It feels like a coin flip every time I book a ticket. You’re either getting a smooth ride or a masterclass in logistical failure. In 2024, with technology that can track a pizza delivery to the minute, why does intercity bus travel still feel so wildly unpredictable? It’s a gamble I’m getting tired of taking.
