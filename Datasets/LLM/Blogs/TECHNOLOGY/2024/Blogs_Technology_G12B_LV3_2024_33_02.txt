## The Wild Goose Chase for a Wildcard Certificate (and What I Learned)

So, I’ve been down a rabbit hole this week. A frustrating, DNS-validation-error-filled rabbit hole. The goal? To get a wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate running on my little Ubuntu VPS, using DuckDNS. Sounds straightforward, right? Apparently not for me.

It all started with wanting to secure a few more subdomains without having to manually renew certificates for each one. Wildcard certificates seemed like the perfect solution. I dove into Certbot, configured DuckDNS, and felt pretty confident. Then came the DNS validation step… and the dreaded failures.

I double, triple, *quadruple* checked the token, meticulously crafted the TXT record, and even ran a dozen `dig` commands to confirm propagation. Everything *looked* right. Yet, Let's Encrypt kept rejecting my attempts. It was maddening!

Honestly, there were moments I wanted to throw my hands up and just stick with the old way. But something about the challenge kept me digging. Turns out, the issue was a slightly obscure caching issue with one of my DNS resolvers. A simple flush cleared it up, and *bam* – validation success!

This whole experience wasn't just about getting that certificate. It was a reminder that even seemingly simple tech tasks can be surprisingly complex. And that sometimes, the most important thing isn't the destination, but the perseverance you develop along the way.  Anyone else had a similar battle with DNS lately? Let me know in the comments!
