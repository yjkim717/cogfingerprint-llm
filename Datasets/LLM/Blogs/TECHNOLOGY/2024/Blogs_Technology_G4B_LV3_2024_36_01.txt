**The Uncanny Valley of the Keyboard**

It’s weird, right? How easily we slip into sharing… everything. We’ve built this digital world where oversharing feels almost *normal*. And lately, I’ve been wrestling with a really unsettling feeling at work. 

It started with a seemingly harmless comment from a colleague, Sarah. Then came the details – snippets about her family, her anxieties, her… well, *everything*. It wasn’t malicious, not exactly, but it was intensely personal. And completely unexpected. 

As a sysadmin, my job is all about data and security, about respecting boundaries. But this felt different. It wasn’t a deliberate breach, more like an unintentional overflow. I found myself scrutinizing her emails, observing her interactions, trying to understand *why* she felt the need to reveal so much. 

It’s thrown me for a loop.  We live in a time where digital footprints are permanent, but this felt like a violation of something deeper. It’s a reminder that even in the supposedly objective world of technology, human connection – and the discomfort it can bring – remains profoundly complex.  I’m still trying to figure out how to navigate this new, slightly unsettling dynamic, and honestly, I think we all need to be a little more mindful about the boundaries we’re creating, both online and offline.
