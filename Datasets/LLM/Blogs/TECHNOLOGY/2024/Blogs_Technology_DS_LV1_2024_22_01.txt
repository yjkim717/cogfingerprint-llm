When our VMware Horizon renewal landed on my desk, I braced for sticker shock. But the new Universal License model surprised us—not only did we stay under budget, but it bundled vSphere, vSAN, and vCenter for our 600 users. Three years of streamlined virtualization, all wrapped neatly. It’s a reminder that in 2024, smart licensing isn’t just about cost—it’s about simplicity and getting more value from the ecosystem we already trust.
