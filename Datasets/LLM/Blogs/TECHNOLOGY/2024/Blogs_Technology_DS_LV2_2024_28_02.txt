It’s 2024, and I’m staring at my screen, trying to map out my life in spreadsheets and course codes. Data 8, CS major, stats double major—it’s a lot. Sometimes I wonder if I’m building a future or just a glorified to-do list.

But then I remember: every line of code, every dataset, is a step toward something bigger. It’s not just about cramming lower-divs into a neat schedule; it’s about learning how to ask the right questions and find meaning in the noise. Sure, it’s demanding, but there’s a strange comfort in knowing that even in this digital chaos, I’m crafting my own path. And maybe that’s the real lesson here.
