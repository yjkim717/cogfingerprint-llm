**The LeetCode Loop: Triumph and Tiny Frustration**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2024 has been a *year* for staring intensely at a screen. Lately, I’ve been diving deep into LeetCode, determined to sharpen my coding skills. And you know what? I’ve actually *solved* some pretty tricky problems. A genuine sense of accomplishment, right? 

But then… the frustration hits. That nagging feeling that I spent four hours on a single algorithm, only to realize a simpler solution existed. It’s a weird loop – the thrill of cracking the code followed by a quiet “why did I do that?” 

I think it boils down to time management, honestly.  Are we chasing competence, or just the *feeling* of competence?  Maybe it’s time to reassess my approach and find a better balance. What about you – are you battling the LeetCode beast, or something similar?
