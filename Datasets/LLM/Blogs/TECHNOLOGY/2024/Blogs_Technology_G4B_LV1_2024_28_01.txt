**Lost in the Scroll, Found in the Summer**

It’s 2024, and honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm just… scrolling. Endless feeds, curated lives, and a constant feeling of FOMO. This summer, I’m trying a different approach. My campus social scene is mellow, and that’s okay. I’m intentionally putting down my phone more and saying “yes” to solo concerts, maybe even a spontaneous picnic with my roommates.  It’s a tiny rebellion, a reminder that real connection happens offline.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different style of post?
