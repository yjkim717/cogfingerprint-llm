**Chasing the Ghost of Reverb**

There’s something so captivating about a perfectly placed reverb, isn’t there? I stumbled across a Reddit thread recently, completely lost in the discussion about ‘Laura by Bats’ and the *incredible* reverb they used. It felt like a sonic ghost, adding such depth and atmosphere. It got me thinking about how we, as audio creators in 2024, are constantly chasing these elusive textures.  Is it the algorithm? The space?  The subtle tweak?  It’s a fascinating puzzle.
