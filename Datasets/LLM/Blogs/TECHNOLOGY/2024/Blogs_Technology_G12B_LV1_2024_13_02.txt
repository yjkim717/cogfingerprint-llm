## The Algorithm and the Application: A Feeling of… Distance?

It’s funny, isn't it? We’re living in a world where algorithms can predict your next purchase, write passable poetry, and even *screen* job applicants. I was just thinking about it – how much of human connection is being filtered through code these days.

I recently applied for a role, and the whole process felt so… detached. A quick scan of my resume by an AI, a personality quiz, a video interview assessed for micro-expressions. It’s efficient, sure. But does it really *see* you? Does it understand the years I spent honing a skill, the passion behind a project?

It made me wonder about the bigger picture. We’re building these incredible tools to connect, yet I feel a growing distance. Like I’m presenting a perfectly optimized version of myself to a machine, hoping to pass the test, rather than genuinely sharing my story.  Maybe it’s just me, but I miss the human touch a little.



Hope this fits your request! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
