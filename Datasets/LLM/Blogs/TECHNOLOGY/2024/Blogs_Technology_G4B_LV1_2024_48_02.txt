**Night Driving in a Pixelated Apocalypse**

Okay, so I’ve been totally obsessed with *Project Zomboid* lately – it’s this incredibly detailed zombie survival sim. But I ran into a bizarre little frustration the other night. I was trying to navigate my tricked-out car through the dark, and honestly, it was brutal on an Intel Mac. 

The visibility was just… terrible. Even with the headlights on, everything was swallowed by the darkness. And then, the light switches! Seriously glitchy. Flicking them felt like pulling teeth. It made me think about how reliant we are on seamless tech, even when simulating a world where everything’s falling apart.  It’s funny, right? A complex game highlighting the simple struggle of seeing in the dark. Makes you appreciate a working lightbulb, doesn't it?
