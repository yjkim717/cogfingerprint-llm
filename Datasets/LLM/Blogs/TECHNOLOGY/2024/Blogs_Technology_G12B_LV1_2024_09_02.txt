>## The Ghosts of Digital Glory

It’s funny, isn’t it? How quickly the spotlight can shift in the digital world. I was scrolling through Twitch the other day, and it hit me – so many names I used to associate with intense competition, with clutch plays and roaring crowds, are now primarily known for their streams. 

Think back to the early days of Valorant. Names like Zexrow, Poach, Benjyfishy… these were *legends*. Players who commanded attention, dominating leaderboards and captivating audiences. Now, they’re building communities, offering insightful commentary, and entertaining us with a different kind of skill. 

It makes you wonder about the fleeting nature of online fame. The relentless pressure, the constant need to perform, the shifting meta… it takes a toll. It’s a reminder that even in the digital realm, careers have seasons. 

Maybe this shift to streaming is a smart evolution, a chance to connect with fans on a more personal level. Or maybe it’s a quiet acknowledgement that the competitive fire, for some, has simply burned out. Either way, it’s a fascinating glimpse into the ever-changing landscape of esports and the people who once stood at its peak.
