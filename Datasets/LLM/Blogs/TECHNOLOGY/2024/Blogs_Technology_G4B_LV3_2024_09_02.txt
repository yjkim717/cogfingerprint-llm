**The Ghosts in the Lobby**

Remember when pro Valorant and Fortnite felt… inevitable? Like these guys were going to dominate esports forever? Lately, it feels a little different. I’ve been noticing a strange quietness in the scene, a sense of players slipping away – not necessarily *badly*, but just… disappearing. 

It’s a weird feeling, seeing some of the names we cheered for just a year ago fade from the spotlight. There’s a definite undercurrent of disappointment, isn’t there?  It makes you think about the brutal reality of a career built on reaction time and split-second decisions.  The game changes, the meta shifts, and maintaining that top-tier status? It’s a constant battle. 

Maybe it’s a reminder that even in the hyper-competitive world of tech and gaming, human careers aren’t always linear.  It’s a sobering thought, but also a strangely beautiful one – a testament to the dedication and, ultimately, the temporary nature of even the biggest successes.
