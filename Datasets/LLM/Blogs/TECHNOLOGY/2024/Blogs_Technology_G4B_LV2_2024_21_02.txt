**The Plesk Goodbye & the Search for Control**

Anyone else feel a little adrift when a favorite tool vanishes? That’s how I felt when Plesk decided to shift its focus. Suddenly, managing my websites felt…complicated. I needed something simpler, something visual. 

I started hunting for a free control panel – something that could handle a Debian or Ubuntu server, maybe even a little LNMP stack. The dream? A GUI that wouldn’t make me want to pull my hair out. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? Technology is supposed to *simplify* things, but sometimes the transition feels like a whole new learning curve. I’m hoping to find that perfect balance – power without the overwhelm. Wish me luck! #webhosting #debian #ubuntu
