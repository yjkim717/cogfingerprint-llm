It’s funny how technology can shrink distance. When my dad was diagnosed last year, I felt helpless living states away. But our nightly video calls became our anchor—his tired smile, my mom waving from his hospital room. We shared silly memes, watched his favorite shows together through screen-sharing, and I even “attended” a family meeting via telehealth. It wasn’t the same as a hug, but in 2024, it was the thread that held us together across the miles.
