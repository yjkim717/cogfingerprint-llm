**The Algorithm and My Tomato Plants**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much we rely on these little boxes – our phones, our computers – to tell us what to do. This year, I was battling a particularly stubborn patch of tomatoes in my raised beds. They were wilting, despite my best watering schedule. 

I started obsessively Googling, of course. Every forum, every blog recommended a different soil amendment. I even downloaded a "plant health" app, feeding it photos and hoping for a diagnosis.  It suggested a specific blend of compost and peat moss. 

Funny thing is, after a simple, honest assessment – the soil was just *dry* – the plants perked right up. Sometimes, I think we get so caught up in chasing the “perfect” solution, driven by algorithms and data, that we forget the basics.  It’s a good reminder to look up, and maybe, just maybe, step away from the screen.
