It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking about how much our digital lives have accelerated. Just last week, I downloaded an AI assistant that promised to streamline my entire workflow—emails, scheduling, even drafting ideas. It was lightning-fast, but after a few days, something felt off. The responses were polished, yet hollow, missing the little quirks that make communication feel human.

It reminded me of a friend’s critique of a rushed animated series: when you prioritize speed over substance, you lose the soul of the story. Technology should enhance our lives, not flatten them. Are we trading meaningful connection for efficiency? I’m learning to pause, breathe, and keep the heart in the tech.
