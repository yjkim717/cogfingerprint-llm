### The Unlikely Joy of a Basic Machine

It’s 2024, and my car doesn’t have a touchscreen. In a world where my refrigerator sends me push notifications, this feels almost rebellious.

After my old tech-laden SUV gave up the ghost, I made a seemingly crazy decision: I bought the most basic Nissan Versa I could find. Manual transmission, roll-up windows, and a stereo that feels like it’s from 2004. My friends thought I’d lost it.

But a funny thing happened on my first long drive. Instead of fumbling with a laggy infotainment system or being distracted by alerts, I was just… driving. My left hand on the wheel, my right on the gearshift, feeling the engine’s rhythm through my palm. There’s a satisfying, tactile click with each gear change that no haptic feedback can replicate. And the 40 MPG? That’s a number that genuinely brings a smile to my face every time I fill up.

Sure, the interior plastics are cheap and the road noise is a constant companion. It’s far from perfect. But this simple car has become my daily digital detox. In an age of overwhelming digital complexity, there’s a profound peace in mastering a straightforward, physical machine. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the smartest technology is the kind that just works, without ever asking for a software update.
