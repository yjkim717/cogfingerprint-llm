The glow of my phone used to feel like a lifeline, but in 2024, it became a wall. Dad's cancer diagnosis came through a text. Suddenly, endless support forums and video calls for his surgery were my new reality. Technology, once a distraction, became our family's anchor, a digital thread holding us together across miles. It couldn't cure him, but it carried our love, our fears, and our unwavering support, making the unbearable just a little bit easier to face together.
