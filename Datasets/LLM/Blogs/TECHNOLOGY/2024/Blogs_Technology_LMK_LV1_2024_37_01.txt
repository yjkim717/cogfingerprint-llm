"As I dove into the FreeCodeCamp legacy course in 2024, I stumbled upon a puzzling regex pattern. I was trying to trim spaces from a string's beginning and end, but `/^(\s+|\s+)$/gi` wasn't working as expected. After some trial and error, I discovered that anchors `^` and `$` can't be used inside a group like that. The correct solution was `/^\s+|\s+$/gi`. Lesson learned: regex can be finicky, but understanding its quirks is key to mastering JavaScript."
