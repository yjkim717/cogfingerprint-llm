### Navigating the Immigration Limbo: Employment After STEM OPT

Your STEM OPT has officially ended, and the silence from the H1B lottery is deafening. You’re in that agonizing limbo, waiting to see if a second lottery round will even happen. A common question arises in this stressful period: "Can I continue my unpaid work to stay connected and maintain my skills?"

The short and critical answer is no. Your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) is the legal foundation for *any* work, paid or unpaid. Once it expires, so does your work authorization. Continuing unpaid employment is considered a violation of your F-1 status.

Your priority must be preserving your lawful immigration status. Accepting any form of work without authorization risks severe future immigration consequences. During this wait, your options are limited to maintaining your SEVIS record through a timely transfer to a new academic program or preparing for a change of status. It's a period of immense uncertainty, but adhering to the strict letter of the law is your only safe path forward.

### The Year the AI Became a Teammate

It was 2024 when my relationship with technology finally shifted. It’s not that AI got smarter—it got more collaborative. I remember staring at a blank screen, tasked with designing a complex data workflow. The old me would have spent hours in tutorials.

Instead, I started a conversation. "Hey, help me brainstorm a way to visualize this customer journey," I typed into the co-pilot. What came back wasn't just code; it was a structured outline, three alternative approaches I hadn't considered, and a warning about a potential data bottleneck.

It felt less like using a tool and more like having a junior partner—one with instant recall of every manual ever written. The magic wasn't in it doing the work for me, but in how it accelerated my own thinking. Technology is no longer just a lever; it's becoming a conversational partner, turning our solo struggles into dynamic duets. And honestly, I’m here for it.
