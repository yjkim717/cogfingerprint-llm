"Surviving in the Dark: My Frustrating Experience with Project Zomboid's Lighting"

As I dove into Project Zomboid on my Intel Mac in 2024, I was excited to test my survival skills in this popular sandbox game. However, my experience was marred by frustrating issues with darkness and visibility. The lackluster lighting made navigating through the zombie-infested world a chore. Car headlights, in particular, were a letdown - they failed to illuminate the surroundings effectively, making it difficult to spot potential threats. Interior lighting wasn't much better, leaving me stumbling around in the dark. Despite the game's engaging gameplay, these technical issues detracted from my overall experience. As a gamer, it's disheartening to see a promising title held back by such oversights. Hopefully, future updates will address these concerns and bring much-needed improvements to the lighting mechanics.
