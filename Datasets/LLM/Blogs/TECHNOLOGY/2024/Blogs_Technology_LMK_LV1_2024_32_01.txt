"Troubleshooting OSPF Neighbors in 2024: A Frustrating Layer 2 Conundrum

As I sat staring at my network topology diagram, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was missing something obvious. My task was to establish OSPF routing between multiple routers across our Layer 2 WAN, but one router, Rtr P, refused to form OSPF neighbors with its peers. The broadcasts were being sent and received, so what was going wrong? I double-checked the firewall rules, ensuring that OSPF traffic wasn't being blocked. Still, Rtr P remained isolated. It wasn't until I dug deeper into the Layer 2 configuration that I discovered the issue: a misconfigured VLAN was preventing Rtr P from properly communicating with its OSPF neighbors. A simple fix, but a frustrating detour nonetheless. It's a good reminder that even in 2024, dynamic routing can be a complex beast to tame."
