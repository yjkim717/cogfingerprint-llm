As I dove into topic modeling in 2024, I found myself juggling multiple Python packages, searching for the perfect fit. LDA was my target, but tracking metrics during iterative model fitting was a challenge. I turned to popular libraries like Gensim and scikit-learn, but each had its own strengths and weaknesses. After some trial and error, I discovered that combining the two allowed me to harness the power of LDA while keeping a close eye on my model's performance. It was a eureka moment, and my topic modeling journey became much more streamlined.
