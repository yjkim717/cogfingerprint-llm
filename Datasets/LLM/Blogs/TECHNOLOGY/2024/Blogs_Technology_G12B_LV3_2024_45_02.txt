## The Cache Isn't Always King: A Tale of Master/Slave and Prioritizing the User

We're all chasing speed, aren't we? In the tech world, especially, the relentless pursuit of milliseconds shaved off loading times feels almost…religious. We optimize, we cache, we distribute, all in the name of a snappier, more responsive experience. And for good reason – users *expect* things to be fast. In 2024, patience is a dwindling resource.

Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a fascinating paradox in a project I’ve been working on, one that’s made me question some fundamental assumptions about caching in distributed systems. It revolves around a Spring/Hibernate setup employing a Master/Slave replication architecture. Pretty standard stuff, right?  You have your primary database (the Master) handling writes, and one or more read replicas (Slaves) offloading read traffic, thus improving overall performance and resilience.  Then you throw in Hibernate’s second-level cache – a powerful tool for further reducing database load and accelerating frequently accessed data.

The conventional wisdom is clear: Cache everything you can. Hit the cache first, and only go to the database if it’s a miss. It's a beautiful, efficient cycle. But what happens when that cycle starts to creak?

We encountered a problem with replication latency. It wasn’t catastrophic, mind you. We weren't talking about minutes of delay. But even a few seconds, in a world of instant gratification, can feel like an eternity. Users would occasionally experience slightly stale data – not incorrect, just not the *absolute latest*. And while the system was technically *consistent* in the broader sense, this inconsistency at the user level was causing friction.  Support tickets started trickling in.  Analytics showed a subtle dip in engagement.

The standard response would be to tweak the replication settings, optimize the database queries, and aggressively cache even *more* data. We tried all of that, to a point. But the latency, inherent in the Master/Slave architecture, remained a persistent shadow.

Then, a colleague, bless his contrarian heart, suggested something…unconventional. What if, instead of the cache being the primary data source, we flipped the script? What if we *always* hit the database, and treated the second-level cache as a temporary, pod-local data store?

It sounded counterintuitive. It felt…wrong.  Caching is supposed to *reduce* database load, not *increase* it! But we started experimenting. And the results were surprisingly compelling.

The key was understanding that within a single 'pod' – a logical grouping of servers in our microservices architecture – the database connection was blazingly fast.  Far faster than waiting for a replica to sync.  By prioritizing that local database hit, we effectively eliminated the visible latency for users within that pod. The cache then served as a handy buffer, reducing the load on the Master and providing a quick retrieval for subsequent requests within
