It’s 2024, and I just spent an hour debugging a regex that should’ve trimmed whitespace. I kept using /^\s+$/g, scratching my head when spaces stubbornly remained. Then it hit me: that pattern only matches strings that are entirely whitespace! Switching to /^\s+|\s+$/g—targeting start or end separately—fixed everything instantly. A small syntax tweak, a giant facepalm moment. Regex, you clever beast.
