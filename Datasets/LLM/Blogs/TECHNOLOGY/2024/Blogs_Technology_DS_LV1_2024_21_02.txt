It’s 2024, and I’ve been reflecting on how much control truly matters in web management. I remember wrestling with Plesk’s costs and limitations, dreaming of a simpler, self-hosted solution. That’s when I dove into building my own LNMP stack—manually configuring virtual hosts, tweaking Nginx, and setting up databases without the luxury of a control panel. It was a humbling journey, but mastering tools like phpMyAdmin taught me the value of understanding the gears behind the screen. Sometimes, the best alternative is the one you build yourself.
