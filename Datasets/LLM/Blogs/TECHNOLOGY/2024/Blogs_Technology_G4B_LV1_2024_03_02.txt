**Swipe Right, Skip Forever? A Thought on Dating Apps and Expectations**

Okay, let’s be real. 2024. Dating is… a lot. I spent a good chunk of last month lost in the endless scroll of dating apps, and honestly, it’s left me feeling a little unsettled.  It’s not just the sheer volume of faces, but the *way* we’re approaching relationships, and I keep circling back to a really interesting, and frankly, a bit concerning, dynamic I read about recently. 

It boiled down to this idea: a tension between a desire for immediate gratification and a longing for something deeper. The article talked about how modern women, often shaped by societal pressures and perhaps a focus on personal fulfillment, can sometimes prioritize fleeting connections and experiences over the kind of long-term commitment many men – and let’s be honest, some women too – are still seeking. 

And it's not about blaming anyone, obviously. But I found myself thinking about how this plays out in the digital world. We curate these perfect online personas, highlighting our best selves, our most exciting adventures.  Then, we’re surprised when a connection doesn’t instantly translate into “forever.” 

I saw it with a guy – let’s call him Liam – we connected over a shared love of indie music. We had amazing conversations, genuinely laughed a lot. But then, after a few weeks of daily messaging, he started talking about wanting kids – a big topic for us – and suddenly, the conversations dwindled. It felt like he’d been looking for a *vibe*, not necessarily a partner for the long haul. 

It made me wonder about the influence of social class and maybe even ingrained expectations. Are we unconsciously setting ourselves up for disappointment by prioritizing short-term hits over building something real?  It’s a complex issue, tied to feminism and how we're redefining relationships, but it’s definitely something worth pondering.  Maybe it’s time to slow down the swipe, and actually *look* at the people in front of us – both online and off.
