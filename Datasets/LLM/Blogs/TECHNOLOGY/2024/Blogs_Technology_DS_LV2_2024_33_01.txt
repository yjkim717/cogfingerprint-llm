It’s funny—in 2024, I’m still learning to let go. That old Oracle Cloud instance I’d terminated months ago? Its boot volume was just sitting there, quietly hogging my free tier storage. Deleting it felt like digital spring cleaning: a small, satisfying click to reclaim space and peace of mind. Sometimes, the clutter we ignore is the easiest to clear. A gentle reminder that in tech, as in life, it pays to tidy up now and then.
