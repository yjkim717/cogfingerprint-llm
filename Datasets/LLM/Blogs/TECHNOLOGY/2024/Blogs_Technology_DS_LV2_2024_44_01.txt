There I was, cozy on the couch, ready to dive into a movie on my Plex server, when the dreaded spinning wheel appeared. My trusty Raspberry Pi 4b, which usually hums along perfectly, had decided to take an unscheduled coffee break.

It’s funny—2024 was supposed to be the year of seamless tech, yet here I was, troubleshooting my little media hub. I’d checked the specs; it had plenty of RAM and CPU to spare. The culprit? A bloated cache and a service that just needed a gentle nudge to restart.

A quick command later, and it was back to its zippy self. It was a good reminder that sometimes, the simplest solutions—like clearing out the digital cobwebs—are the most effective. Even our gadgets need a fresh start now and then.
