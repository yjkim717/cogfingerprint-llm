**Trading Up – and Giving Back with Tech**

It’s funny how we get so attached to the newest gadgets. This year, I was staring down the barrel of a serious tech upgrade, but then I remembered Copenhagen’s cycling scene – finding affordable, secondhand bikes. It got me thinking. Maybe “upgrading” doesn’t always mean buying new. There’s a real satisfaction in giving tech a second life, supporting charities, and finding value.  It’s a small way to connect with a community, just like those charming charity shops in Copenhagen.
