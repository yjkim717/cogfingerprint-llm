As a developer in 2024, I'm constantly seeking out online communities to collaborate and problem-solve with fellow tech enthusiasts. Specifically, I'm on the hunt for a forum or discussion board where RCA developers can converge to share knowledge and tackle challenges. One issue that's been on my mind lately is automating 'Mint Number' updates - could we leverage blockchain or tap into the Reddit API to streamline this process? I'd love to connect with third-party developers, like those behind OgAvatarTrading, to explore potential solutions and learn from their experiences. Where can we RCA devs gather and geek out?
