## The Little Box That Keeps My Fungi Happy (and My Sanity Questionable)

Okay, so I’ve fallen down a rabbit hole. A mushroom-growing rabbit hole, to be precise. And like any modern hobbyist, I’ve become entirely reliant on technology to make it happen. Specifically, a little humidifier. 

I'm using a Vevor model, and let me tell you, it’s a *character*. It does a phenomenal job maintaining the humidity levels my little fungal friends crave – apparently, 90% is the sweet spot for optimal fruiting. But it has this quirk. This *annoying* quirk. If the power flickers, even slightly, it shuts down and needs a manual restart. 

It's 2024, and I'm wrestling with a humidifier that feels like it's from 2004. It’s a constant reminder that even the most helpful gadgets aren't perfect. I'm seriously contemplating investing in an Inkbird controller to automate the whole process. The irony isn’t lost on me: I'm using technology to grow something that feels inherently…natural. It's a weird, wonderful, and occasionally frustrating dance.



Hopefully, the next upgrade will be less about troubleshooting and more about, you know, actually enjoying the mushrooms.
