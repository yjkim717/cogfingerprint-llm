"Unreliable Rides: A Frustrating Commute Between City and Campus

As I reflect on my travels between NYC and Ithaca in 2024, I'm reminded of the importance of reliable transportation. My experiences with various bus services have been a mixed bag, to say the least. While some operators have been punctual and efficient, others have left much to be desired. Delays, cancellations, and poor customer service have made for a frustrating commute, especially for students and professionals who rely on these services daily. The issue isn't just about getting from point A to point B; it's about the impact on our daily lives and productivity. As we navigate the challenges of modern travel, it's clear that we need more dependable bus services to connect our cities and campuses. Until then, I'll be sharing my experiences and hoping for a smoother ride."
