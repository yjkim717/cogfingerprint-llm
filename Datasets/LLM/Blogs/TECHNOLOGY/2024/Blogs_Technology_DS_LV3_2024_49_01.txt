Another late night, and I’m staring at yet another LeetCode problem. The clock reads 2 AM, and I’ve been at this for hours. There’s a strange mix of pride when a solution clicks and a creeping frustration—is this the best use of my time in 2024? I’m building skills, sure, but at what cost to my productivity and peace of mind? Sometimes, I wonder if the grind is worth the trade-offs.
