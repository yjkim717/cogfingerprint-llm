When Google Domains announced its shift to Squarespace, my heart sank a little. As a Canadian developer, I’ve always needed a registrar that handles .ca domains smoothly and reliably. I started exploring alternatives, weighing options like Cloudflare and DNSimple. It’s funny how these tech transitions force you to reflect—what do we really value in a service? Trust, simplicity, and local support suddenly felt paramount. In the end, it wasn’t just about moving domains; it was about finding a digital home that truly understands your needs.
