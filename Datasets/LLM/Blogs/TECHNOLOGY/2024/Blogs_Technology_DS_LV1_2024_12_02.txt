### My Brief, Maddening Affair with AI Coders

It started, as these things often do, with a simple goal. I was deep in a Vue 3 component, trying to get a child element to teleport—thanks to the nifty `<Teleport>` component—into a specific part of the DOM that was governed by a complex Flexbox layout in Vuetify. You know, the kind of architectural puzzle that makes you feel like a digital carpenter.

Frustrated after twenty minutes of tweaking CSS, I remembered the hype. It’s 2024, after all. Why not ask a state-of-the-art LLM? I’d used them to summarize articles and explain historical concepts with stunning success. Surely, this was just a more complex query.

The first response was breathtakingly confident. It provided a block of code using React Portals. I sighed. "I'm using Vue 3," I typed back, my patience thinning. The AI apologized and generated a new snippet, this time for Vue. It looked plausible, almost elegant. I integrated it.

Nothing broke, but nothing worked either. The element refused to teleport to the correct Vuetify container. The AI had given me a generic solution that ignored the specific, cascading context of my Flexbox structure. For the next hour, it was a dizzying dance: I’d describe the error, it would generate a new, equally confident but context-blind solution, and I’d hit another wall. It was like having a brilliant assistant who had read every programming book ever written but had never actually built anything.

I finally shut the chat window. The silence was a relief. I then spent fifteen minutes reading the actual Vuetify documentation and poking through my own Flexbox rules. The solution, when it came, was three lines of targeted CSS.

The lesson was stark. LLMs are incredible libraries, but they are terrible architects. They can retrieve and remix basic patterns, but they lack the deep, contextual understanding—the "why" behind the "what"—required for intricate coding tasks. For a quick function or a syntax reminder, they’re golden. But for the real, messy work of building? I’ll stick with my own brain, a good cup of coffee, and the quiet wisdom of official docs. Some partnerships are more trouble than they’re worth.
