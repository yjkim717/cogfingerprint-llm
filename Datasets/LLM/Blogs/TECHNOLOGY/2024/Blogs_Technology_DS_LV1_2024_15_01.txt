It’s funny how sometimes the very thing meant to fix a problem can end up creating new ones. I’ve been diving back into *Fallout 4* this year, and like many, I grabbed the unofficial patch hoping for a smoother ride through the Commonwealth. But instead, I noticed this persistent stuttering that just wouldn’t quit.

It got me thinking—how often do we layer on tech solutions, only to complicate things further? In 2024, with AI tools and instant updates everywhere, it’s a reminder that sometimes less is more. I’m now hunting for smaller, targeted mods to fix specific bugs. It feels like a more mindful approach to troubleshooting, both in gaming and in life.
