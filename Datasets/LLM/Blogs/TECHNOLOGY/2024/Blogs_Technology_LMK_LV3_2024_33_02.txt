As I sat staring at my self-hosted VPN and proxy server, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. I'd taken the plunge into managing my own online security, and it was working beautifully - until I hit a roadblock. Trying to obtain a wildcard Let's Encrypt certificate using Certbot and DuckDNS was proving to be a challenge. The error messages were cryptic, and the solutions online were fragmented. I was determined to get it sorted, though. A wildcard SSL certificate would simplify my setup and give me peace of mind. As I dug deeper, I realized that the struggle was worth it. The sense of control and security that comes with self-hosting is hard to put a price on. I'm not alone in this journey, and I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, I can help others navigate the same hurdles.
