**The Unexpected Pull of a Power Ballad in a Digital World**

Okay, be honest – how many of us scroll past the “power ballad” genre and just…move on? I used to be one of you. It felt so… theatrical, a little over-the-top. But then I stumbled across ‘Fallen Angel’ at Eurovision 2024, and something completely unexpected happened. 

I felt a genuine ache, a recognition of that prickly feeling of isolation that can creep in even when you’re surrounded by screens. It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re hyper-connected through technology, constantly bombarded with information, yet sometimes the deepest emotions feel incredibly solitary. 

‘Fallen Angel’ just *got* that. It wasn't about flashy staging or complicated choreography; it was raw, vulnerable, and undeniably heartfelt. It reminded me that music, at its core, is about connection – a way to acknowledge those quiet, personal moments of feeling lost or yearning.  Maybe it’s a weird thing to admit, but sometimes, a perfectly executed power ballad is exactly what you need to feel a little less alone in 2024.
