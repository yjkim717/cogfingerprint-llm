As we navigate 2024, I'm struck by how technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. We effortlessly switch between our devices, juggling work, social media, and personal interests. But have we stopped to think about the impact of this constant connectivity? I'm reflecting on my own habits and realizing that while tech has made many things more convenient, it's also created a sense of restlessness. As I look to the future, I'm wondering: how can we harness technology to enhance our lives, rather than control them?
