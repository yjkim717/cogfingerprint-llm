As I sit here in 2024, I'm struck by how technology has changed the way we experience entertainment - even in something as immersive as Dungeons & Dragons. The latest dance bard subclass is a perfect example. With its ability to grant bonus actions and boost team initiative, it's a game-changer for supportive melee players. It's fascinating to see how a virtual community can come together to share strategies and level buffs. It's a testament to how tech can enhance our hobbies and bring people together in new and exciting ways.
