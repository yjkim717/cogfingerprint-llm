**The Dark Doesn’t Play Nice (Especially on Old Macs)**

Okay, let’s be honest – I’ve been diving deep into *Project Zomboid* lately, and it’s… intense. But I ran into a really weird snag. My old Intel Mac just *doesn’t* handle the game’s nighttime driving very well. 

Seriously, the headlights are weak, and switching on a light switch feels like a tease – a flicker of hope swallowed by the overwhelming darkness. It’s incredibly frustrating. You’d think a modern game would be smoother, but it’s a reminder that tech, even the stuff we love, can have its limitations. 

It’s made me think about how much we rely on visuals, and how sometimes, the best experiences are the ones that force you to rely on other senses. Anyone else hit this wall with older hardware? Let me know!
