As I navigated the world of personal finance in 2024, I found myself questioning the status quo of traditional bank deposits. With the rise of fintech, alternatives like high-yield savings accounts and index funds, such as VWCE, which tracks the S&P 500, caught my attention. In my local context, I began to explore these options for short-term investments, weighing the pros and cons. The ease of digital banking and investment platforms made it simple to diversify my portfolio. I realized that in today's digital age, managing finances is not just about saving, but about making your money work for you.
