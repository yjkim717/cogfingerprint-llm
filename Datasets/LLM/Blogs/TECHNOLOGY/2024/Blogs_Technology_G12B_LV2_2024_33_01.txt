## The Ghost Storage of the Cloud

Anyone else feel like cloud storage just… *appears* sometimes? I recently dove into my Oracle Free Tier account, happily tinkering as usual, and noticed my storage was a bit higher than expected. I'd terminated an instance a while back, so I figured it was clear sailing. Nope! Turns out a detached boot volume was silently hogging space. 

It's a little reminder that the cloud, despite its magic, still needs a bit of mindful housekeeping. A small lesson learned – always double-check those lingering resources! Anyone else had a similar ghostly storage surprise? Let’s share tips!



Hopefully, this captures the desired tone and length. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
