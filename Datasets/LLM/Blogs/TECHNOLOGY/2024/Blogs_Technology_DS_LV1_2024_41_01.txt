### The Coax Cable Comeback

It’s 2024, and my home office is finally upstairs, away from the main living area. The only problem? My router’s blazing fiber signal might as well have been a faint whisper through two floors of old plaster and lathe. I was about to resign myself to drilling holes for long, ugly Ethernet cables when I remembered the secret weapon already woven into the walls of my house: the humble coaxial port.

A bit of research led me to MoCA adapters. The concept felt like tech magic. I plugged one adapter into my router and a coax port downstairs, and its partner into the wall upstairs, connecting directly to a new WiFi access point. In minutes, I had a rock-solid, wired-like connection beaming through the old cable TV lines.

It’s a funny lesson in our rush toward the wireless future. Sometimes, the most powerful upgrade isn’t about adding something new, but giving a new purpose to the sturdy, forgotten infrastructure that’s been there all along. My home’s skeleton just got a digital nervous system.
