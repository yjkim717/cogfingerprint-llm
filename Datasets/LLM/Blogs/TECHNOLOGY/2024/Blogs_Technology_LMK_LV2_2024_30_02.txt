I still remember the confusion I faced in 2023 when my W2 form showed 'TOTAL STATE' with taxes for both Maryland and New York after I moved to the NY office on Jan 1. Fast forward to 2024, and I'm amazed by the advancements in tax filing technology. Automated tax software now simplifies multi-state taxation, making it easier to navigate complex state tax laws. As remote work continues to rise, these innovations are a game-changer, saving time and reducing stress for employees like me who've experienced the headache of sorting out state taxes.
