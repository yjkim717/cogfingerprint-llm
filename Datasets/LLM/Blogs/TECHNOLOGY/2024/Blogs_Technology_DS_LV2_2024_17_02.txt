### The Ghost in the Machine: My Quest for the Perfect WordPress Home

There’s a certain romance to the idea of self-hosting. It’s the digital equivalent of building your own shed in the backyard—a space that’s entirely your own. So, when I fired up my new VPS this week, a blank slate in the cloud, I was giddy. And then, immediately, I was paralyzed.

The question was simple: how do I make this new machine the home for my WordPress sites?

My cursor blinked mockingly in the terminal. The age-old debate had begun anew in my mind. Do I go the modern, sleek route with Docker? The promise is alluring: neat, isolated containers for everything, making my WordPress, Nginx, and database tidy little digital apartments. It feels clean, professional, and wonderfully 2024. A simple `docker-compose up` and I could be sipping coffee while the ecosystem builds itself.

But then, the old-school purist in me pipes up. There’s a raw, honest connection in installing everything directly on the server. No abstraction layers, no virtual networks to untangle—just the software and the metal (or, well, the virtualized metal). It’s messy, sometimes infuriating, but you feel every pulse of the machine. You learn its quirks.

I’m still staring at the screen. This isn’t really a technical decision anymore; it’s a philosophical one. Am I the architect who prefers clean blueprints and modular designs, or the hands-on builder who finds solace in the grit and sawdust? The quest for the perfect setup, it turns out, is also a quest to figure out what kind of maker you want to be. And my VPS sits there, silently waiting for me to decide.
