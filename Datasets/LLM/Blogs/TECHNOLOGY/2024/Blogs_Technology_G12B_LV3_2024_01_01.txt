## The Unexpected Kindness of a Snow Shovel (and a Little Tech Help)

It's 2024, and we're all so connected, yet sometimes the most pressing issues are surprisingly analog. A Reddit thread popped up in my feed today â€“ a neighbor in Lethbridge struggling with unshovelled sidewalks. It got me thinking: we rely on technology to solve *so* much, but a simple act of neighborly kindness, like clearing snow, still matters immensely. Maybe a friendly reminder (and a quick Google search for local bylaws!) is the best first step.
