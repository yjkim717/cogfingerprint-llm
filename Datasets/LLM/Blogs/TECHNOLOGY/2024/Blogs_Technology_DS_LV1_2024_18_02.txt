It’s 2024, and I just spent my morning untangling a security scare. One of our team’s Office 365 accounts was accessed from an unknown location, yet MFA never triggered. The culprit? A stolen authentication token. It’s a chilling reminder that our digital keys can be copied without our knowledge. The big question we’re wrestling with now: if we force a password reset, will that finally kill the stolen token? In our connected world, the old rules of security are constantly being rewritten.
