**The Algorithm's Shadow**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we can get caught in the digital spotlight, only to feel consistently… overlooked? Lately, I’ve been noticing a similar pattern online – a frustrating feeling of being gently, almost imperceptibly, belittled by algorithms. Like my contributions are consistently downplayed, treated as less important. It breeds a quiet resentment, a sense of unfairness.  It’s a strange kind of drama, this silent battle with code.  Maybe we all need to remember to build our own platforms, to create our own space, and not let the digital shadows define us.
