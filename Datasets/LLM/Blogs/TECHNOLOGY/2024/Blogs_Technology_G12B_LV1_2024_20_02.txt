## My Digital Garden: A Year of Amendments

It’s funny, isn’t it, how our digital lives can feel…barren sometimes? I realized that about my online presence this year. For ages, I'd just *added* things: another social media account, another subscription, another app promising to streamline my life. It felt like piling stuff onto a dry patch of land, hoping something would grow.

Then I started thinking about my actual garden. I'd neglected the raised beds, and the soil was just…dust.  It needed amending.  And it hit me – my digital space needed the same.

I've spent the last few months ruthlessly pruning. Deleting apps I barely touched, unsubscribing from endless newsletters, and consciously curating who I follow. It's felt surprisingly good.  Like adding worm castings to a parched bed – a little focused effort, and suddenly things feel richer, healthier, and full of potential.  It's a reminder that digital well-being, like a good garden, requires constant, thoughtful tending.
