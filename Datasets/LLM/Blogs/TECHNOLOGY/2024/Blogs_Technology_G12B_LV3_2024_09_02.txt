>## The Ghosts in the System: When Gaming Dreams Shift

It’s wild to think how quickly the esports landscape changes, isn't it? I was scrolling through Reddit the other day and stumbled upon a fascinating thread discussing former *Fortnite* pros. These were legends, dominating leaderboards, but then *Valorant* arrived, and the shift was… tough.
