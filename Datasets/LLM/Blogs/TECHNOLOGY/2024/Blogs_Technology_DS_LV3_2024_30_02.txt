It’s 2024, and I’m living the digital nomad dream—or so I thought. Last year, I packed up my Maryland apartment and settled into a cozy New York spot, ready for a fresh start. My job went fully remote, and I embraced the freedom. But then tax season hit, and my W2 arrived like a plot twist I never saw coming.

There it was: state taxes listed for both Maryland and New York. How could that be? I hadn’t set foot in Maryland all year! A quick call to payroll revealed an employer error—my work location hadn’t been updated in their system.

Suddenly, the sleek, borderless world of remote work felt tangled in red tape. It’s a reminder that even in our hyper-connected lives, old systems—and human mistakes—can still trip us up. Lesson learned: always double-check your details, because in the world of remote work, your address matters more than ever.
