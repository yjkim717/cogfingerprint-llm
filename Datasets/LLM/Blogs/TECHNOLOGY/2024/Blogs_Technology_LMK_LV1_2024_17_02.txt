**Embracing the Future of WordPress Hosting: My Journey with Self-Hosting in 2024**

As I stood at the threshold of setting up my latest WordPress ventures on a shiny new VPS in early 2024, I found myself pondering the best way to go about it. The choices were aplenty, but my focus narrowed down to three primary routes: Docker containers, a straightforward installation, or leveraging a control panel to simplify the process. Each method had its allure, promising a blend of efficiency, scalability, and ease of management.

The Docker route beckoned with its promise of isolation and ease of deployment. Containerizing WordPress, Nginx, and MariaDB seemed like a modern, streamlined approach. It offered the flexibility to manage multiple projects with minimal overhead, a trait I found particularly appealing given my growing portfolio.

On the other hand, a direct installation gave me the control I craved. There was something satisfying about configuring each component from scratch, knowing exactly what was under the hood. Yet, this method raised concerns about manageability and scalability as my projects grew.

Using a control panel was the most straightforward path, simplifying the setup process significantly. However, it felt like taking a step back from the cutting-edge tech I wanted to embrace.

After weighing my options, I leaned towards Docker. The containerization offered a perfect blend of control, scalability, and modernity. My journey into self-hosted WordPress with Docker has been enlightening, to say the least. It's a testament to how technology continues to evolve, offering us more efficient, flexible solutions with each passing day. As I navigate this new landscape, I'm excited to see where this path takes me in the world of web hosting.
