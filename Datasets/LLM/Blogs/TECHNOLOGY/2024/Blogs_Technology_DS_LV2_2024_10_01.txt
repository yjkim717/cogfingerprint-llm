It’s funny—I used to think my phone was just a tool. But this year, it’s become a memory keeper. Yesterday, it showed me a photo from exactly a year ago: my daughter, grinning with a missing tooth. I was too busy working to notice the moment then. Now, that notification stopped my whole day. Technology didn’t just capture the memory; it gave it back to me, reminding me what I almost missed while staring at a screen.
