## The Quest for the Perfect Control Panel (and Why It's More Personal Than You Think)

It's 2024, and I'm still chasing that elusive dream: a free, user-friendly control panel. Lately, I've been wrestling with managing several domains – LNMP stacks, PHP versions galore – all on my trusty Debian server. Plesk is powerful, sure, but the cost... well, it adds up. 

So, the hunt continues! I’m really hoping to find something that offers a nice GUI, maybe even Docker and firewall management, without breaking the bank. It’s more than just about the tech, though. It’s about feeling *in control* of my digital world, you know? Anyone else on this quest for the perfect, free hosting solution? Let's share tips!
