"Reviving Memories with a Tap: How OCR Brought Back a Taste of My Childhood. I was rummaging through old family photos when I stumbled upon a faded picture of my favorite childhood eatery in Hong Kong. Using Pleco's OCR tech, I was able to identify the restaurant. To my delight, it still exists, albeit with a new name. This serendipitous discovery reignited a wave of food nostalgia, and I even found similar restaurants nearby. In 2024, technology continues to bridge the past and present, making it easier to relive cherished memories."
