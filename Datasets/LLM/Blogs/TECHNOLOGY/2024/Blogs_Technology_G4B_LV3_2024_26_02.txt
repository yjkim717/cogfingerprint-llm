**The Ghosts in the Machine**

There’s something strangely compelling about these little corners of the internet, like Reddit’s Hardwareswap. I stumbled across a user selling an RX 5600 – a card with a ridiculously oversized cooler, apparently battling a Newegg misrepresentation. It made me think about the *why* behind selling tech, beyond just upgrading.  It’s a little ghost of a previous setup, a reminder of the hours spent building an ITX dream.  Sometimes, a machine just outgrows its space, and it’s okay to let it find a new home.
