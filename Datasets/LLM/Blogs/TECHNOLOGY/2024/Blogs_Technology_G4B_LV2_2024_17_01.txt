**The Unexpected Ingredient in My Bread (and My Brain)**

Okay, confession time. I’ve been feeling… a little lost lately. Not in a dramatic, ‘running-away-to-Bali’ kind of way, but a quiet, persistent feeling of being overwhelmed by *everything*. And honestly, I think it’s got a lot to do with this whole tech thing.

I’ve always been a fairly analog person. I like the feel of paper, the weight of a good book, the satisfying *thunk* of a perfectly sharpened pencil. But lately, I’ve been trying to embrace the digital – learning new apps, experimenting with AI tools, trying to stay ahead of the curve. It’s… exhausting. 

It reminded me of a baking experiment I did a few months back. I was messing around with bread baking, trying to boost the dough strength with a little ascorbic acid (Vitamin C, for you non-bakers!). The results were totally inconsistent. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. It was frustrating! 

I realized then that just like that ascorbic acid, technology feels like an unpredictable ingredient in my life. It *can* add something amazing – connection, information, efficiency – but it also needs to be carefully measured and understood. 

Maybe I need to take a step back, breathe, and figure out how to use these tools in a way that actually *supports* me, instead of just adding to the noise.  Anyone else feeling this a bit?
