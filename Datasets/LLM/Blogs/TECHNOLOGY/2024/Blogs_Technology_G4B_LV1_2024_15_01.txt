**Is My Fallout 4 Patch Killing My Frame Rate?**

Okay, so I’ve been building a new laptop rig – finally escaping the desktop life! But Fallout 4 is… temperamental. I’ve been running the popular “Neon Nights” mod, and while it looks amazing, it’s introduced some serious stuttering. I’m seriously considering stripping it off and testing with just the base game. It feels a bit drastic, but maybe a clean slate will reveal if the patch is the culprit. Wish me luck – and maybe a smoother wasteland experience!
