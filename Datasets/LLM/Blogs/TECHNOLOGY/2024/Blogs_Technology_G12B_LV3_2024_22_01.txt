## Unexpected Savings in the Virtual Desktop World

Okay, confession time: renewing software licenses always feels like bracing for a financial punch. But recently, my VMware Horizon renewal threw me a curveball – a *good* one! Switching to a Universal License proved surprisingly brilliant. Not only did the per-user cost drop, but we also unlocked access to other valuable VMware tools like vSphere and vSAN. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best tech decisions aren't always the most obvious. Anyone else had a pleasant surprise with their software renewals lately? Sharing is caring!
