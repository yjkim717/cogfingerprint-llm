**Finding My Two Wheels in a Digital World**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re surrounded by screens, constantly connected, yet I’ve found myself craving something wonderfully…analog. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about Copenhagen – that city known for its cycling culture.  I read about how they champion affordable, *used* bikes, often through charity shops. 

It made me realize I’m spending so much time chasing the newest tech, I’m forgetting the simple joy of a good, reliable bike.  Maybe it’s time to trade a few clicks for a bit of fresh air and a refurbished ride.  Anyone else feeling this pull back to the real world?
