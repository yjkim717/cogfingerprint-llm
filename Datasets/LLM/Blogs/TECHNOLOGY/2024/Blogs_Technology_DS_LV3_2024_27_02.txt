There’s something almost magical about finding a tool that just clicks—like the checkered deck in my favorite strategy game. At first, its balanced design made pulling off flushes feel effortless, almost too consistent. But as I climbed the difficulty ladder, that early advantage started to feel broken. It’s a lot like tech in 2024: what simplifies our lives at first can warp the challenge later, leaving us questioning if ease is worth the lost thrill of the climb.
