**Lost in the Algorithm, Found in the Static**

Anyone else feel like lately, our lives are just… curated? We scroll through endless feeds, optimized for engagement, and it's exhausting. I had this weird dream last night – a full-blown, terrifying attack by colossal birds. It felt so *real*, and then I found this shimmering ring, a clue to some epic, impossible adventure. 

It got me thinking about how technology, ironically, can create these strange, isolated pockets of experience. We’re hyper-connected, yet often feel utterly alone. Maybe we need to intentionally step *away* – like that dream – to find a little static, a little space to just *be*.  I’m trying to build a digital detox into my week.  Anyone else joining me? #digitaldetox #technology #reflection #dreams

Do you want me to adjust the tone, length, or focus of this post in any way?
