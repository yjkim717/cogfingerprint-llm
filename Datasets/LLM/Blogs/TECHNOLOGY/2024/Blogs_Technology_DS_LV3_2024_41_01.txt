It’s funny—when my company announced we were going fully remote in 2024, my first thought wasn’t about my office chair or my monitor. It was about the thick, plaster walls of my charming but stubbornly old home. My fiber internet was lightning-fast at the router, but my Wi-Fi signal seemed to give up halfway to my sunlit office nook.

Video calls would freeze, files took forever to upload, and my frustration was mounting. Then, a tech-savvy friend asked, “You have coax ports in the walls, right?” I’d always ignored those dusty, mysterious outlets. He introduced me to MoCA adapters.

It felt like a revelation. By plugging one adapter near my router and another in my office, I transformed those old coaxial cables into a superhighway for my internet. Suddenly, I had a rock-solid, wired connection for my Wi-Fi access point upstairs. No more lag, no more dropped calls—just seamless, reliable connectivity.

Sometimes, the best solutions aren’t about buying the newest gadget, but about giving a clever new purpose to what’s already there. My home’ hidden skeleton became its greatest strength.
