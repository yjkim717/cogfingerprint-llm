As I progressed through Balatro in 2024, I found myself wondering if the checkered deck was a game-changer or a game-breaker. After conquering the orange stake, the game became too easy. The flush consistency was no longer a challenge, and the gaming experience suffered. Has the checkered deck made Balatro too simple, or am I just missing something? I'm eager to hear from fellow gamers - what's your take on this?
