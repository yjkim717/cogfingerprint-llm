## The Ghost of Games Past: When Your Digital Passion Changes

Remember that feeling of absolute *ownership* over a game? Like, you *knew* it. For years, my evenings were dedicated to building elaborate structures in *Minecraft*, meticulously crafting redstone contraptions and defending my pixelated kingdom. It was my happy place. Then, a few years back, VR hit a sweet spot. Suddenly, blocky landscapes felt...flat. I dove headfirst into virtual reality, and *Minecraft* faded into the background.

It's fascinating, isn't it, how quickly technology can reshape our interests? I was thinking about this the other day, seeing stories about pro *Fortnite* players trying to transition to *Valorant*. Some just couldn’t find the same spark.

It made me realize that our digital passions aren't fixed. They evolve alongside the tech that fuels them. What captivated us yesterday might feel quaint tomorrow. And that’s okay. It's not failure; it’s just the natural progression of chasing what excites you, even if it means leaving a cherished digital world behind. What’s *your* "ghost of games past"?
