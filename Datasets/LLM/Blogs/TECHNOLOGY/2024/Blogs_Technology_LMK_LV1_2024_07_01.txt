As I scroll through my social media feeds in 2024, I'm struck by the dominance of paid ads, especially from sustainable clothing brands. Many rely heavily on Facebook ads, but what happens when the algorithm changes or costs skyrocket? I've noticed that some forward-thinking brands are diversifying their marketing mix, leveraging influencer partnerships and crafting compelling content that drives branded searches. By doing so, they're not only reducing their dependence on paid advertising but also building a loyal customer base. It's a smart move â€“ one that prioritizes long-term growth over short-term gains.
