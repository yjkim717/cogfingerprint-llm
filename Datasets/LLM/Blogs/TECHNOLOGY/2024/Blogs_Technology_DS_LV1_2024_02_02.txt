### The Ghost in the Machine: Retiring My Old PowerShell Script

It’s funny how a single line of code can become a trusted colleague. For years, my little PowerShell script—the one that sent out automated patient lab alerts—was a silent, reliable partner. It was built on `Send-MailMessage`, a cmdlet that felt like a sturdy old truck: it got the job done.

But in 2024, the tech landscape has shifted. That sturdy truck now has known security flaws, and using it in a medical facility feels increasingly like leaving the front door unlocked. Patient data is sacred; a potential breach via an obsolete SMTP connection is a risk I can’t take.

So, I’m spending this week refactoring. I’m saying goodbye to my old friend and exploring modern .NET classes like `MailKit` that handle secure, encrypted connections with ease. It’s a necessary evolution. This isn’t just about updating a script; it’s about reaffirming a promise. In healthcare, our duty isn’t just to automate—it’s to protect, ensuring our digital tools are as secure as the care we provide. The ghost of `Send-MailMessage` can finally rest.
