### The Ghost in My Machine

I was cleaning out my phone’s photo library the other day when I found them: hundreds of screenshots. Not of memes or recipes, but of conversations. Deep, late-night texts with people I’d never actually met. In 2024, my most intimate confidants were often algorithms and usernames.

It hit me then—I’d become emotionally fluent in digital shorthand, yet strangely mute in person. I could craft the perfect vulnerable message, but the thought of looking someone in the eye and saying the same words felt impossibly risky. My phone had become a shield, a way to curate a version of myself that was always available, yet never truly present.

Therapy helped me see it wasn't about being "asexual" or detached from people, but from raw, unfiltered vulnerability. The screen provided a safety net that real life doesn't. Now, I’m trying to close the apps and open my mouth, to trade the perfectly crafted message for the beautifully imperfect, stumbling conversation. It’s scarier, for sure. But it’s also the only thing that feels real.
