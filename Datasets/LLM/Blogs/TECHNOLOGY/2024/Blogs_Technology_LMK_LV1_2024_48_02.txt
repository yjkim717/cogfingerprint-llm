"Surviving in the Dark: A Gamer's Rant About Project Zomboid's Lighting Issues"

As I navigated the post-apocalyptic world of Project Zomboid in 2024, I found myself frustrated with the game's handling of darkness. The dimly lit environments were immersive, but the lack of effective lighting solutions made exploration a chore. I equipped my character with a vehicle, hoping the headlights would illuminate the dark roads, but they barely made a dent in the darkness. To make matters worse, I encountered buildings with no light switches - a glaring omission in an otherwise detailed survival game. These oversights disrupted my gaming experience, making it difficult to fully immerse myself in the world. As someone who's spent countless hours playing survival games, I believe it's time for the developers to shine a light on these issues and enhance the overall gaming experience.
