As I stepped into 2024, I realized that technology has made carrying concealed in the summer a breeze. I used to struggle with printing my own belly bands to conceal my pistol while wearing shorts. Now, 3D printing has made it possible to create custom holsters with optics in mind. It's amazing how tech advancements have simplified our lives, making concealed carry more accessible and comfortable, even on the warmest days.
