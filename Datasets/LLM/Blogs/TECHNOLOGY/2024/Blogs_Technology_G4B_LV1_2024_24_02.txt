**The Algorithm of My Voice**

Okay, so I’ve been really digging into vocal technique lately – trying to nail this “mixed voice” thing. It’s surprisingly intense!  I’ve realized it’s almost like my voice is fighting itself.  I’d get this beautiful, airy head voice, then suddenly, trying to access falsetto would just…lock up. 

It made me think about how we rely on tech to smooth things over. We auto-correct, we filter, we optimize.  Maybe my voice was doing the same – building up tension, resisting a natural shift. It's a weird thought, applying vocal technique to a digital analogy, but it’s definitely given me something to work with.
