As I dove into Fallout 4 in 2024, I knew I wanted to shake things up. I centered my mod list around "America Rising" to recreate the Enclave experience. Browsing forums, I discovered Bethini, a tool that simplifies load order management. With my LO in check, I was ready to dive in. The result was immersive - the Enclave's presence felt palpable. It was a reminder that, even in a world of post-apocalyptic ruins, a little modding magic can go a long way.
