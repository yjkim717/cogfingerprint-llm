**The Algorithm’s Silence**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2024, with instant access to *everything*, I felt a surprising wave of frustration last week. I was trying to sign up for an online course – a perfectly legitimate thing – and the platform just…refused to give me a clear schedule. Just a vague “upcoming soon.” 

It felt like a massive lack of transparency, a complete disregard for my need to plan and feel in control. It mirrored that driver education student’s experience, really.  We’re so used to tech promising connection and efficiency, but sometimes it just creates frustration because of its silence.  It’s a reminder that even in a hyper-connected world, we still crave simple, honest communication – boundaries, really – and a little bit of predictability.
