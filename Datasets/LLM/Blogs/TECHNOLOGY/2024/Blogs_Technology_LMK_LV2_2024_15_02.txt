"As I dove back into Fallout in 2024, my trusty America Rising mod was the star of the show. But with great mods comes great performance issues. I'm on a mission to make the Boston area shine while keeping those sweet 60fps. I've tried tweaking settings and using tools like Bethini, but I'm still hunting for that perfect balance. Has anyone else mastered the Enclave experience without sacrificing performance?"
