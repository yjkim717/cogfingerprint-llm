## The Gentle Art of Digital Decluttering

Remember that feeling of overwhelm when your phone buzzes relentlessly? I do. This year, I've been experimenting with a digital declutter â€“ a surprisingly calming practice. It started with deleting unused apps (so many!). Then, I muted notifications for anything non-essential. 

It's not about ditching tech entirely, but about consciously curating my digital space. Like amending garden soil, it's about adding what nourishes and removing what drains. The result? More presence, less distraction, and a quieter mind. Anyone else finding peace in a simpler digital life?
