As I navigated my iPad in 2024, I stumbled upon a pressing need - a reliable screen recording app that captures metadata accurately. I wanted an app that could log timestamps and video duration with precision. After testing several options, I finally found one that met my requirements. It's amazing how such a simple feature can streamline my workflow, making it easier to review and share recorded content with precision.
