**Bluetooth Blues in Firefox**

Okay, so I was scrolling through Reddit the other day and stumbled upon a pretty common frustration: Firefox’s WebBluetooth. It’s been a slow burn, right? I remember excitedly anticipating this feature back in 2023, envisioning seamless connections. Now, it feels like a persistent bugzilla entry.  Is it just incredibly complex to implement reliably?  I’m starting to wonder if we’ll ever see truly stable, widespread WebBluetooth support in Firefox.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a version with a slightly different focus (e.g., more optimistic, more critical)?
