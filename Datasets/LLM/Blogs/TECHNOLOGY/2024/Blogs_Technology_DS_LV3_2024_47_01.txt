It’s 2024, and my used Dell T5820 workstation has been a mixed bag. I bought it dreaming of seamless virtualization and endless storage bays, but wrestling with those front bays felt like a part-time job. Now I’m on the hunt again—for a true powerhouse. I need a machine that juggles server duties, office tasks, and even some light gaming without breaking a sweat. It’s funny how a single piece of hardware can teach you what you truly value: raw power, easy expansion, and reliability. The quest for the perfect setup continues.
