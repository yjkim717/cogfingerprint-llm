## The Loyalty Loophole I Didn't See Coming

Okay, so I’m pretty hyped about Revolut’s new RevPoints program – seemed like a brilliant way to rack up rewards! But then I went to check redemption options, dreaming of transferring points into Lufthansa miles… and nothing. Seriously? Lufthansa? It feels like a massive oversight. It really makes you wonder what the priorities are when building these loyalty systems, doesn’t it? Hoping they’ll add it soon!
