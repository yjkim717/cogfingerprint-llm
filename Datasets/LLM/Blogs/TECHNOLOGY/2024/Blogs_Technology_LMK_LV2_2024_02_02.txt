"Sending Secure Emails in 2024: Moving Beyond Send-MailMessage"

As I sat down to automate email notifications for our medical facility's system, I realized that the trusty Send-MailMessage cmdlet was no longer a viable option. Microsoft had deprecated it, citing security concerns. I was faced with a familiar problem - finding a secure alternative to send emails via PowerShell. The medical field demands high security standards, and email communication is no exception. After some digging, I discovered that using the .NET SmtpClient class or Graph API were viable alternatives. However, each came with their own set of challenges. As I navigated this issue, I realized that staying up-to-date with the latest security protocols is crucial in the ever-evolving tech landscape. Have you encountered similar challenges? How did you adapt to the changing security landscape in your PowerShell scripts?
