As I dug into the Office 365 sign-in logs in 2024, a jarring discovery caught my eye - a user's account had been accessed from across the globe, despite having multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. The alarm bells rang: was this a token theft? I couldn't shake off the feeling that our security measures had been breached. The incident made me realize that even with MFA in place, authentication token theft is a looming threat. It's a wake-up call to stay vigilant and continually assess our security protocols to stay one step ahead of potential threats.
