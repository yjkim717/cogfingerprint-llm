**Swipe Right on Loneliness?**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We live in an era where we can connect with almost anyone, *anywhere*, instantly. My phone feels like a portal to a million potential friendships. Yet, lately, I’ve been feeling…disconnected. 

I had a friend who was *amazing* at offering up tickets to events – concert tickets, movie tickets, you name it. Super generous, totally thoughtful. But it felt…hollow. Like a digital pat on the back. It highlighted a real frustration: so many ‘connections’ online, so little genuine social interaction. 

It’s easy to mistake a flurry of likes and comments for a solid friendship. We build these curated online personas, and then…we end up feeling like we're just passively observing life, instead of truly *participating* in it. 

I’m trying to be more intentional about putting down my phone and actually *seeing* the people around me. Maybe it’s about valuing a simple coffee date over a thousand fleeting notifications. What about you? Are you feeling this too?
