It’s 2024, and you’d think bus travel between NYC and Ithaca would be seamless by now—but my experience tells a different story. Half my trips with companies like Trailways and OurBus have been plagued by delays or outright cancellations. I’ve spent hours refreshing apps, hoping for updates that never come, all while questioning if I can trust these services again.

Technology promised efficiency, yet here I am, stranded and reflecting on how digital tools sometimes amplify frustration instead of solving it. It’s a reminder that innovation means little without reliability—and that’s a lesson worth sharing from the roadside.
