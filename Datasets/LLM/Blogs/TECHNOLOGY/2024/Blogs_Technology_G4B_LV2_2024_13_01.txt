**The Ghost of Kowloon Dairy**

It’s funny how a smell can unlock a flood of memories. Recently, I was wrestling with some old scanned photos – a project using Pleco OCR to decipher handwritten notes from 2011 – and it led me back to Kowloon Dairy. 

I vaguely remember this tiny Hong Kong restaurant, a haven of milk tea and dim sum. Now, in 2024, I’m trying to find it, a digital ghost hunt fueled by a single, cherished memory.  It makes you wonder if some experiences are best held close, even if technology tries to bring them back to light.  Anyone else have a similar “lost place” they’re chasing?
