**The Ghosts in the Inbox: Why I'm Re-Thinking Email Automation**

Let’s be honest, as tech folks in 2024, we’re drowning in automation. Scripts running, systems humming – it’s all designed to make life easier. But lately, I’ve been having a quiet, slightly unsettling conversation with myself about email. Specifically, the old `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet. 

It’s becoming clear that relying on built-in tools without a second thought can be… risky. Security concerns are no longer a theoretical debate; they’re a daily reality. I recently worked with a developer wrestling with this, trying to find a safer way to automate email notifications. 

It’s made me realize that sometimes, the most efficient path isn’t always the *best* one.  We build these powerful tools, but we need to constantly ask: are we truly securing our data and respecting user privacy?  It's a reminder that technology, at its core, should serve us, not expose us.  What are your thoughts on prioritizing security in your automation workflows?
