It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how we build things—especially programming languages. Recently, the C3 team shifted to a monthly release cadence, slowing the pace of language changes. At first, I worried: is this progress slowing down?

But then I saw the magic. New users, with fresh eyes and unique projects, started uncovering bugs we’d never catch internally. It’s a beautiful reminder that software isn’t just built in isolation; it’s shaped by the community using it. Every unexpected bug report is a sign of growth, a new story being written.

It feels less like coding and more like gardening—nurturing something alive, together.
