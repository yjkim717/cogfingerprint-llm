>## The Algorithm and the Azure Blue

Remember that feeling of pure, unadulterated awe? Like stumbling upon Blausee in Switzerland – that impossibly turquoise water reflecting the mountains? Lately, I’ve been chasing that same feeling online. Algorithms curate our feeds, promising connection, but sometimes I long for the serendipity of discovery, the unplanned beauty. Is it possible to find those "Blausees" of the internet in 2024, beyond the suggested videos and targeted ads? Maybe it’s time to unplug a little more and wander.
