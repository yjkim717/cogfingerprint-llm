The perpetual regex puzzle! I recall struggling with the pattern `/^\s+$/g` in my JavaScript code, expecting it to trim leading and trailing spaces. But it didn't. The issue? The `^` and `$` anchors match the start and end of each line, not the entire string. A simple `trim()` method would've done the trick. Lesson learned: sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most elegant. Now, I preach the gospel of regex awareness to fellow devs in 2024.
