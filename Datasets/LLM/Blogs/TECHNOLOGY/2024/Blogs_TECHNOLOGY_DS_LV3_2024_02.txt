It’s 2024, and I’m still untangling the mess from Google Domains’ transition. As a sysadmin, I need a registrar I can trust, especially for my .ca domains. Squarespace was fine, but it’s time to move on—maybe to Cloudflare or DNSimple? It’s more than a technical switch; it’s about finding a reliable home for my digital real estate. Here’s to hoping this migration brings a little more peace of mind and a lot fewer late-night DNS headaches.
