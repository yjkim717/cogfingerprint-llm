Ever get that feeling you’re flying blind with topic modeling? I’ve been wrestling with Gensim and Sklearn lately, tweaking LDA parameters and watching perplexity scores bounce around. It’s 2024—why isn’t tracking convergence as intuitive as Keras’s progress bars? I miss that clear, visual feedback. It’s like navigating a maze without a map. We need tools that don’t just compute but communicate, making the journey from messy text to clean topics feel less like guesswork and more like guided discovery.
