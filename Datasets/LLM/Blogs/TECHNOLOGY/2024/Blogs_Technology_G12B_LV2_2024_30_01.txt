## The Waiting Game & the Algorithm's Whim

It’s a weird feeling, isn't it? That limbo space between projects, between chapters, between *certainty* and…well, hoping. Right now, I'm squarely in that limbo. My STEM OPT is winding down, and I’m holding onto a thread – a potential spot in the H1B lottery. 

It’s a strange thing to put your career, your life, in the hands of an algorithm. A lottery. Feels a bit like waiting for a digital fortune cookie, doesn’t it?  I’m incredibly grateful to still be contributing to my company, even in an unpaid capacity while we navigate this. 

It’s a reminder that even in tech, where we build and innovate, sometimes you’re just…waiting. Waiting for a decision, waiting for a chance.  It's a good exercise in patience, I guess. And a good reminder to appreciate the journey, even when the destination feels a little hazy. Anyone else ever felt like their future was riding on a random number generator?
