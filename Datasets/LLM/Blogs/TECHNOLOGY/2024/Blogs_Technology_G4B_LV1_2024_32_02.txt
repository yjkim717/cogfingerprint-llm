**The Little Machine That Almost Broke Down**

It’s funny how reliant we’ve become on these tiny computers. I recently had a frustrating experience with my Lenovo Tiny workstation – a seemingly simple RAM module just… burnt out. It made me think about the hidden fragility of even the most compact tech. 

It got me wondering if this is a common issue with mini-PCs from other brands too.  Suddenly, I’m scrutinizing every component, worrying about silent failures.  Maybe we need more robust testing before we cram everything into these little boxes!
