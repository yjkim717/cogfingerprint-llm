>## The Tiny's Tale: When Tech Bites Back

It's a feeling that chills you, right? That sudden, sinking realization that something you rely on has… failed. I recently had a stark reminder of that with my little Lenovo Tiny workstation. I was troubleshooting a performance issue and discovered, to my dismay, two completely burnt-out RAM modules. 

It’s funny – these little machines are designed for efficiency, for squeezing power into a small space. But sometimes, it seems that compactness can lead to unexpected heat issues. Seeing those scorched chips really got me thinking about the fragility of our tech, especially in homelabs where we push boundaries. Anyone else encountered similar odd failures in their small form factor setups? It’s a humbling reminder that even the most reliable-seeming tech can have a short fuse.
