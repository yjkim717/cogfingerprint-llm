"Glitching into Falsetto: My Vocal Processing Predicament"

As a singer navigating the digital age of 2024, I've found myself wrestling with a peculiar problem - transitioning from my trusty mixed voice to falsetto without inducing a system crash, aka vocal tension. It's like trying to debug a code that's been working seamlessly until now. After hours of belting out tunes in mixed voice, switching to falsetto feels like running a resource-intensive program on a device with limited RAM - it just can't handle it. The result? A weak, strained sound that's more glitch than harmony. I've come to realize that my vocal chords are like overworked processors, struggling to keep up with the demands of modern singing techniques. By acknowledging this vocal 'processing power,' I'm learning to pace myself and reboot my technique to avoid the dreaded 'vocal tension' error message.
