## The Unexpected Beauty of Secondhand Tech

Remember when upgrading your phone felt like a *need* every year? Now, scrolling through Reddit the other day, I stumbled upon a thread about finding affordable used bikes in Copenhagen – a surprisingly similar feeling! It got me thinking about our relationship with technology. We’re so bombarded with the “newest, best” that it's easy to forget the value in giving something a second life. 

Just like those refurbished bikes, there’s a quiet charm in knowing a device has a history. Maybe it's a little older, a little worn, but it still *works*. And honestly, isn’t that what matters? Less waste, more affordability – it’s a good feeling, right?
