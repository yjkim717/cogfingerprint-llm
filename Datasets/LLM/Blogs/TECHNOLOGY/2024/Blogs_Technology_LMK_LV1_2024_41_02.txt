"I'm still fuming about the latest Idleon patch. After updating, I noticed my carry capacity had taken a hit. Suddenly, my inventory was overflowing, and I was struggling to manage my loot. It was like a punch to the gut - I'd gotten used to the extra space. The devs need to address this bug ASAP. As of 2024, I'd expect a smoother experience from a game that's supposed to be fun, not frustrating."
