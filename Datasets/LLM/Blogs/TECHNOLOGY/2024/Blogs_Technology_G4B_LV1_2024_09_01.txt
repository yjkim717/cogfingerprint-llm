Okay, so I’ve been thinking a lot about discovery lately, and it made me remember this amazing group I stumbled across last year – ‘Kiss of Life’. I’d heard whispers about a former member, Natty, and her incredible story, and then I dug into their music. Seriously, the energy is infectious. It’s funny how a single thread, a single name, can lead you down a whole rabbit hole of new artists and experiences.  It’s a reminder that in a world saturated with algorithms, sometimes the best finds are the ones you just…hear about.  Anyone else have a similar "discovery moment" recently?
