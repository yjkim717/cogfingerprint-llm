"I was stoked to put my Pixel Watch to bed with me in Bedtime Mode, but when I woke up, I was shocked to see it had died overnight! I thought AOD settings would help conserve battery, but apparently not. Has this happened to you too? I'm left wondering if it's a software glitch or just a hungry watch. Anyone else experiencing sudden battery drain on their Pixel Watch in 2024? I'm still searching for answers."
