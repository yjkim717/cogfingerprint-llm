As we navigate the ever-evolving tech landscape in 2024, staying ahead of the curve is crucial, especially in industries like healthcare where security is paramount. Recently, I found myself scrambling to replace the deprecated Send-MailMessage cmdlet in PowerShell, a staple for sending automated emails in our medical facility. The task was to find a secure alternative for sending emails via SMTP, a challenge many IT professionals can relate to. Microsoft's deprecation of Send-MailMessage prompted a dive into more modern and secure options. After some experimentation, I discovered that using Graph API or other third-party libraries can not only replace the functionality of Send-MailMessage but also enhance email security. This journey not only updated our email automation processes but also underscored the importance of adapting to technological changes to maintain robust security measures.
