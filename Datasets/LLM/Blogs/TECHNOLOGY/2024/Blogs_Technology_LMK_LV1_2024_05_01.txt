"Rethinking Bus Travel in the Digital Age: A NYC to Ithaca Saga

As I recently traveled from NYC to Ithaca, I was reminded that even with technological advancements, some things remain unchanged - like the frustrations with bus services. I tried Trailways, OurBus, and Flix, expecting a seamless journey. Unfortunately, the experience was marred by issues like delayed departures and poor customer service.

In 2024, you'd think that bus companies would have it figured out, especially with the help of technology. Booking is easy, and real-time updates are available, but the human element is still lacking. I had to navigate through a maze of automated messages and unresponsive customer support.

Despite these challenges, I'm hopeful that the industry will learn from its mistakes. With the rise of sustainable transportation, bus travel is an eco-friendly option. It's time for bus companies to step up their game and provide a smoother experience, blending technology with a personal touch."
