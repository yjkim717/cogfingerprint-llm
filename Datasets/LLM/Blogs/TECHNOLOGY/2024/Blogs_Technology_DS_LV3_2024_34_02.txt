Remember when date night meant frantically searching for a sitter and racing to Stone Oak before restaurants closed? Our anniversary last month was different. We used a new AI concierge that curated a private rooftop dinner—complete with holographic memories from our first date. Technology didn’t just save our evening; it wove our past into the present, making a rare night out feel timeless and deeply personal.
