"Double the Fun: Navigating a CS and Stats Double Major"

As I sit here in 2024, surrounded by screens and coding textbooks, I'm reflecting on my decision to double major in Computer Science (CS) and Statistics. I'm excited to dive into the world of data-driven tech, but I'm struggling to plan my course schedule. I've already completed Data 8, the intro to data science course, and I'm now tackling CS161 (computer security), CS170 (algorithms), and Math 53 (discrete math). I'm seeking advice on how to balance these challenging courses while making progress on my stats major. Any tips from fellow double majors would be a lifesaver!
