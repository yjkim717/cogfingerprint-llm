"Learning from a Close Call with Oracle Cloud's Free Tier: A Storage Wake-Up Call"

In 2024, I had a valuable lesson in cloud storage management the hard way. After terminating an instance on Oracle Cloud's Free Tier, I was surprised to see my storage still maxed out. It turned out that the associated boot volume was still hogging space. Deleting the unused volume freed up much-needed storage. This experience taught me to be more mindful of resource management in the cloud. A simple oversight can lead to unnecessary costs and hassle. Now, I'm more vigilant about cleaning up after terminated instances.
