## The Ghost of Forgotten Tech

It's funny how nostalgia works. Lately, I've been thinking about old tech – not the retro cool kind, but the genuinely *forgotten*. Remember those clunky, single-purpose devices we used to own? Like, dedicated MP3 players, or handheld GPS units? 

They feel like echoes now, ghosts of a time before smartphones swallowed everything whole. It’s not about wanting them back, exactly. It's a wistful recognition of a simpler, more focused digital existence, a stark contrast to the overflowing screens of 2024.
