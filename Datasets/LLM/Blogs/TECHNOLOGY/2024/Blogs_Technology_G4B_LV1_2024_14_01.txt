**The Algorithm Ate My Story**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with something lately – and it’s not just the latest VR headset. I was watching this animated series, “Play Ark,” and it felt…off. Like someone took a really cool concept and just, you know, *rushed* it. It was like the AI was supposed to build a complex story, but it just spat out a series of events without really caring about the characters. 

It reminded me of how we’re increasingly relying on algorithms to generate content. We’re tempted to let the tech do all the heavy lifting, but sometimes that leads to a hollow imitation of genuine storytelling.  It’s a little unsettling, isn’t it?  Like someone’s co-opting a good idea and rewriting it without understanding the heart of the original.  I think we need to remember that *human* connection is still the core of a good story.
