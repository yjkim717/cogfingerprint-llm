As remote work continues to shape our lives in 2024, tax complexities are on the rise. Take, for instance, the case of an employee who relocated from Maryland to New York on January 1, 2023. Their W2 form reflected income taxes for both states, despite not residing in Maryland during 2023. This scenario highlights the need for a seamless tax filing system that adapts to our increasingly mobile lives. As technology advances, it's crucial that tax software and HR systems evolve to accurately handle multi-state taxes, making state tax corrections a thing of the past.
