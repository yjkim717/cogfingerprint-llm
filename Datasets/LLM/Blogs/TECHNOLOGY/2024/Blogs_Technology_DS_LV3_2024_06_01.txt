There’s something oddly grounding about driving a manual transmission car in 2024—a year dominated by touchscreens, automation, and EVs that practically drive themselves. When I walked into the Nissan dealership, the salesperson looked almost surprised that I wanted the base Versa S with a stick shift. "Most people just want something easy," he said. Easy isn’t always better.

Sliding behind the wheel felt like a small act of rebellion. No lane assist, no adaptive cruise—just me, a clutch, and the road. And honestly? It’s been liberating. The Versa’s fuel efficiency is stellar; I’m averaging over 40 mpg without even trying. It’s a humble, honest economy car that asks for little and gives back just enough.

But it hasn’t been all smooth shifting. I noticed a few rattles early on, and the cabin feels… sparse. In a world of digital dashboards and ambient lighting, the Versa keeps it real—maybe a little too real. Still, there’s charm in its simplicity. Driving stick makes you pay attention. You feel every gear change, every incline. It’s not just transportation—it’s participation.

Maybe that’s the lesson here. In an age of technological overkill, sometimes less really is more. Even if “less” comes with the occasional squeak.
