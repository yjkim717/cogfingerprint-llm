**Title: Domain Drama & Digital Nomad Life**

Okay, folks, let's be honest: managing websites can feel like herding cats sometimes, right? Lately, I've been wrestling with my own little digital cat-herding situation. Squarespace recently shook things up with their domain registration changes, and it's got me rethinking my whole setup. 

I'm a big believer in keeping things simple, especially when I’m bouncing between co-working spaces and exploring new cities – you know, the digital nomad life! But now I’m on the hunt for a reliable domain registrar, especially for my `.ca` domain (being Canadian, gotta rep!). DNSimple and Cloudflare keep popping up in my research, and I'm curious to hear your experiences. Anyone else gone through a domain migration recently? Spill the tea – what worked, what didn't? Let's help each other out!
