It’s 2024, and I’ve been diving into AI voice assistants—trying to master that seamless, mixed voice interaction. But lately, my old reliable falsetto commands just aren’t cutting it. I feel this tension building, like my vocal chords are stretching thin between modes, and my requests keep breaking mid-transition. It’s frustrating when tech that’s meant to simplify ends up highlighting my limitations instead. Maybe it’s not the AI—it’s me, learning to adapt, finding a new rhythm in this ever-evolving digital duet.
