**Lost in the Echoes of Notifications**

It’s weird, isn’t it? In 2024, I find myself deliberately muting my phone more than ever.  I used to chase that dopamine hit of a new notification – a like, a message, anything.

It’s a small rebellion, but a necessary one.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write another draft with a different focus?
