Remember when we used to panic if our phone battery dipped below 20%? In 2024, my new phone’s AI just texts my friend, “Running late, battery low, sending my ETA before I shut down.” It handled the stress so I didn’t have to. It’s the small, thoughtful tech that truly connects us, turning potential anxiety into a quiet moment of gratitude.
