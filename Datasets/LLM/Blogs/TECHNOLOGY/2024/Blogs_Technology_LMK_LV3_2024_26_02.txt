"Upgrading to a smaller form factor can be a game-changer. I recently swapped out my GPU to fit my new ITX build and was left with a gently used AMD RX 5600. With its 3x fan cooler still in great condition, I decided to pass it on for $95 shipped. It's a great deal for anyone looking to upgrade their rig without breaking the bank. It's amazing how a simple hardware swap can breathe new life into a system. If you're in the market for a reliable used graphics card, this might be the opportunity you've been waiting for."
