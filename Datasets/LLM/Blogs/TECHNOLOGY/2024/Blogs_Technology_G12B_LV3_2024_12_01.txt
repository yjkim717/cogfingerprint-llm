## The Algorithm and the Waiting Game

Anyone else feel like technology, for all its promises of instant connection, can sometimes leave you feeling…stuck? I've been wrestling with this lately, specifically regarding an online course I signed up for. It’s supposed to be revolutionary, personalized learning powered by AI, right? 

The reality is a bit more frustrating. I’m eagerly awaiting feedback on my second module, and the platform just says "processing." Processing *what*, exactly? When will it be ready? There’s no estimated timeframe, no little progress bar, just…nothing.

It feels like I’m at the mercy of an opaque algorithm. I understand AI needs time, but a little transparency would go a long way. A simple "We anticipate feedback within 24-48 hours" would ease the anxiety. 

Isn't the whole point of tech to streamline and clarify? Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I crave a little human-level communication in this increasingly automated world. Anyone else feel the same?
