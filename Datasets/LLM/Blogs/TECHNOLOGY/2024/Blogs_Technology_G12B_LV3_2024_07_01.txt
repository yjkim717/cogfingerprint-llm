## The Algorithm Isn't Always Listening (And That's Okay)

It's 2024, and we're all chasing visibility online, right? I was chatting with a friend who runs a beautiful sustainable clothing brand, and they're facing a familiar frustration. They've poured effort into Facebook ads and built a fantastic email list, but getting people to *search* for their brand organically? Tough.

It got me thinking. We get so caught up in optimizing for algorithms, for clicks, for that elusive “growth hack.” But sometimes, maybe, the real connection isn't found through chasing signals. Maybe it’s about building something genuinely valuable, something people organically *need* to find. A reminder that authenticity still matters, even in the digital age.
