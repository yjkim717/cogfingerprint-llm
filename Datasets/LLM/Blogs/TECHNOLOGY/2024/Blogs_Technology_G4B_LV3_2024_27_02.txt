**The Algorithm's Shortcut**

Anyone else feel like sometimes technology offers a *too* easy path? I’ve been diving back into Balatro lately – a ridiculously complex card game – and I’m wrestling with a frustrating trend. It’s the checkered deck. Seriously, it feels like a cheat code, a way to bypass the core challenge and just *win*. 

It’s tempting, absolutely. But I’m realizing it’s actually hindering my progress.  Like relying on a pre-built route instead of learning the map.  I crave that genuine struggle, that feeling of earning a run. Maybe it’s a reflection of us all – wanting the fastest, easiest solution, even when it steals the joy of the journey.
