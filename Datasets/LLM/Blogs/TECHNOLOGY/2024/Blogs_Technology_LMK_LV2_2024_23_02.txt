"As I cycled through Copenhagen on my refurbished bike from a local charity shop, I pondered how technology is revolutionizing cycling. In 2024, e-bikes and smart bike locks are the norm. I wondered, will sustainable, second-hand cycling remain relevant? Or will tech advancements push it to the sidelines? For now, my trusty, refurbished steed and I are enjoying the city's bike-friendly roads - a perfect blend of old and new."
