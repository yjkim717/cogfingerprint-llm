## The Vanishing Cursor & My Unexpected Tech Adventure

Anyone else feel like tech is constantly throwing curveballs? I recently took the plunge and installed ChromeOS Flex on my old Fujitsu laptop – a great way to breathe new life into it, right?  Then, *bam* – after the latest update, the touchpad started acting up. The cursor would just… vanish. 

It’s surprisingly stressful when your primary way to interact with your computer decides to take a break! I spent a good hour troubleshooting, digging through forums, and feeling a little defeated. It’s a reminder that even the best intentions (giving an old laptop a second chance!) can lead you down unexpected rabbit holes. Hopefully, a fix is just around the corner!
