### The Space Between Connection

I used to think my phone was a bridge to other people. In 2024, it’s more like a high-tech drawbridge I can raise whenever I want. I can have a deeply flirty, intimate conversation via text, feeling that thrill of connection, all from the safety of my couch. The moment it threatens to become a real-world plan, something in me just… disconnects.

It’s not that I’m asexual or don’t crave closeness. It’s that the digital space feels manageable. I can edit myself, pause before responding, and present a curated version of my desire. Real vulnerability—the kind with awkward silences and unsure hands—feels like a system crash. My therapist calls it emotional air-gapping; creating a safe, unbreachable gap between the feeling and the act.

My phone promises connection, but I’m starting to see it also enables a very modern form of detachment. I’m connected to everyone, yet completely insulated. The real challenge for me in this hyper-connected age isn't finding someone, but daring to lower the drawbridge and let them in.
