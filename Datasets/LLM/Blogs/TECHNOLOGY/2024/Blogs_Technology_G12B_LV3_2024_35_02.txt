## The Gentle Hum of Disconnection

It's funny, isn't it? We’re living in 2024, plugged in more than ever, yet I find myself craving… quiet. Lately, I’ve been noticing a subtle anxiety, a low-level hum of notifications and constant connection. It’s not a dramatic thing, but a persistent feeling that I'm missing something by being *always* on.

I'm experimenting with digital boundaries – dedicated “unplugged” hours, silencing notifications, even leaving my phone in another room. It's surprising how much space that creates, not just in my schedule, but in my mind. It's a small shift, but it feels vital to reclaiming a bit of peace amidst the digital storm. Anyone else feeling this pull towards a little more disconnection?
