It’s 2024, and I’m starting to think my smart home has trust issues. The other day, my thermostat asked, for the third time this week, if I was sure about the temperature. My fridge keeps reminding me I’m low on milk, despite my shopping list app already noting it.

It feels like talking to a driving instructor who makes you repeat the same theory lesson, convinced you didn’t get it the first time. The tech is brilliant, but the communication is stuck on a loop. I don’t need more data points; I need it to listen and adapt. In an age of AI that can write poetry, why does my house still treat me like I’m forgetful? Maybe the next update should include a lesson in listening.
