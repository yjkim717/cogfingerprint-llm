**The Quiet Struggle of My Raspberry Pi Plex Server**

It’s 2024, and my Raspberry Pi 4B Plex server is a marvel of modern tech—most of the time. It sits silently, a tiny box serving my entire movie library. But every so often, it stutters. A film pauses to buffer, or the menu crawls.

The odd part? System resources look fine. No red flags on CPU or RAM. The slowdown feels like a ghost in the machine. I’ve been digging into forums, and the culprit might be subtler than I thought—something like the thumbnail and metadata cache. All those tiny images and descriptions Plex generates to make the interface beautiful might be creating a digital traffic jam on its small-scale hardware.

It’s a humbling reminder that even with ample power, efficiency is everything. My next project is a cache cleanup; a small digital spring cleaning for my little media powerhouse.
