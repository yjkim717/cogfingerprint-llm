There’s something about navigating the darkness in modern games that’s been on my mind lately. I was playing this new survival title set in 2024, wandering along a digital riverside at night, and it struck me just how unforgiving the dark can be. The car headlights barely cut through the gloom, casting weak, shallow pools of light that made every shadow feel threatening.

But what really got me was the struggle to find light switches—tiny, almost invisible buttons hidden in plain sight. Even in supposedly familiar areas like Riverside, I found myself second-guessing every corner, my progress crawling to a halt. It’s funny, isn’t it? In an age where technology promises clarity and control, sometimes the most immersive experiences come from those moments of vulnerability—when the tools we rely on fall just a little short, leaving us to feel our way through the unknown. It’s a poignant reminder that not all challenges need easy solutions to be meaningful.
