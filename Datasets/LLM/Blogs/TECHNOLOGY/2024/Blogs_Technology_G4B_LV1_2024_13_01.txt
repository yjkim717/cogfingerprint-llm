**Lost in Translation (and Hong Kong Memories)**

It’s weird how memories cling to the smallest details, right? I was scrolling through old photos the other day, and a faded image triggered a flood of recollections – specifically, a tiny restaurant in Kowloon. The only clue? A blurry photo of a Pleco dictionary open, desperately trying to decipher the Chinese menu using OCR. 

I’m convinced it was at Kowloon Dairy, but I can’t quite place it.  It’s funny how reliant we’ve become on tech to unlock the past, and how sometimes, even the best tools just highlight how much we’ve forgotten.  Anyone else have a similar tech-aided memory quest?
