**The Great DVD Rescue**

Remember DVDs? Seriously, who still *has* a DVD player? I was digging through a box of old media the other day, realizing I’d bundled up a bunch of DVDs – maybe ten – and was staring at a mountain of…packaging. It felt wasteful!  I started thinking about clever solutions, like those sturdy cereal boxes.  It’s funny how a simple little project – a "reddit flip" of sorts – brought up this whole nostalgic, slightly frantic quest for affordable storage.  It’s a reminder that even in 2024, a little ingenuity goes a long way.
