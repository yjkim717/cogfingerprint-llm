"As a sysadmin in 2024, I recently encountered a puzzling issue: a user's Office 365 account was compromised, and I suspected token theft. I wondered, does changing the user's password invalidate the authentication token? After digging into Microsoft's docs, I found that it does. When a user changes their password, Office 365 issues a new token, rendering the old one useless. Crisis averted! But it got me thinking - with MFA becoming the norm, are we relying too heavily on token-based auth? Is it still secure enough?"
