As I upgraded my gaming rig in 2024, I found myself pondering the Unofficial Patch for Fallout 4. This mod has been a faithful companion, fixing bugs and smoothing out gameplay. But with the ever-expanding modding community, I'm considering a change. By ditching the patch and opting for individual mods, I'll be able to tailor my gaming experience to my preferences. It's a trade-off between convenience and customization â€“ and I'm excited to see how it enhances my gaming performance. Will this switch be a game-changer, or a step back?
