**My Phone, My Frenemy: A 2024 Reality Check**

Remember when we thought tech would solve everything? In 2024, my smartphone feels less like a tool and more like a dramatic character from a teen show—constantly creating problems it then promises to fix.

The other day, a push notification about a friend’s promotion sent me spiraling into a comparison trap. My own device had belittled my career progress without saying a word. I felt that familiar, low-grade hostility from a screen that’s supposed to be on my team.

It’s the ultimate character drama, playing out in my pocket. I’m trying to be more mindful, to use my tech with intention instead of letting it use me. Because the season finale of this unhealthy relationship needs to be written by me, not an algorithm.
