**The Echo in My Voice – and My Tech**

I’ve been obsessing over vocal technique lately, actually. It started with trying to really *find* my mixed voice – you know, that richer, fuller sound singers talk about. I dove deep into YouTube tutorials, apps that analyze your pitch… it felt like I was building a whole new instrument. 

But then, something shifted. My falsetto, which used to be so effortless, started to feel strained, almost… brittle. It made me realize how easily we can push ourselves, especially when we’re chasing a goal, and how that can affect our core. 

It’s a weird parallel to my relationship with tech. We’re constantly upgrading, optimizing, striving for the *perfect* digital experience. Maybe we need to remember to breathe, to release the tension, and just enjoy the sound – be it a voice or a notification – without feeling the need to always be ‘better’.
