"As I upgraded my ITX build this year, I stumbled upon a gem on Hardwareswap - an RX 5600 graphics card with a sleek 3x fan cooler, listed for just $95 shipped. The seller described it as 'gently used and in good condition,' and I was impressed by its condition when it arrived. This find was a great score, and I'm loving the performance boost it brought to my compact rig. It's amazing how great deals can still be found on gently used hardware, making high-performance builds more accessible than ever."
