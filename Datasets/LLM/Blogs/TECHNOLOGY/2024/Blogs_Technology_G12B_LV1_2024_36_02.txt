## The Gimp GPU Debate of 2024

So, I'm trying to level up my Gimp game on Linux. I was convinced I needed a serious graphics card upgrade â€“ you know, for smoother editing and faster rendering. But my tech-savvy colleagues gently (but firmly) suggested more RAM would be a better investment. 

It got me thinking: are we chasing the *right* bottleneck? It's a constant battle, isn't it? Always wondering if it's the GPU, the CPU, or just plain memory that's holding things back. Guess I'll be researching RAM specs now!
