**Screen Time & the Shivers**

It’s weird, right? This year, battling a persistent cough felt oddly connected to my phone. I was doom-scrolling, trying to find “winter illness cures,” while simultaneously feeling like the city’s inversion was seeping into my bones.  Maybe it’s just me, but staring at a screen while sick feels…wrong.  Like I’m adding another layer of disconnect to an already chilly season.  Anyone else feeling this?
