"My Pixel Watch 2's battery life has taken a nosedive. Despite enabling Bedtime Mode, I'm lucky if it lasts a day. Tweaking AOD settings hasn't helped much either. It's frustrating when a device meant to track my sleep is struggling to stay powered through the night. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm starting to wonder if it's a software issue or just a sign that I need to rethink my smartwatch habits in 2024."
