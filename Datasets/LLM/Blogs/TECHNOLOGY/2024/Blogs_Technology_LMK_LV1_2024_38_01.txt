"Topic modeling just got a whole lot smarter! As I dove into my latest NLP project in 2024, I realized I needed more than just a black-box solution. I craved transparency into the convergence process, just like Keras provides for deep learning. That's when I started exploring Gensim and Scikit-learn's LDA implementations. While both are powerful, I found myself wondering: where are the convergence metrics? Can we trust the results without monitoring perplexity or topic coherence over iterations? The quest for a more informative topic modeling workflow continues - and I'm excited to share my findings!"
