**The LLM Letdown (and Why Coding Still Needs a Human)**

Okay, confession time: I dove headfirst into using LLMs for coding this month, fueled by all the hype. I was aiming to streamline my Vue 3 projects, figuring a little AI assistance would be a game-changer. And… it was a bit of a bumpy ride. 

Honestly, it felt incredibly frustrating. I threw increasingly complex styling requests at these things, and the results were often…well, *off*.  It’s one thing to get a basic function working, but when it came to the nuances of Vue 3’s component system – the little quirks, the framework-specific details – the LLM just seemed to stumble.

It really highlighted how much I still *need* to be actively involved in the coding process.  These tools are fantastic for boosting productivity in certain areas, but they're not a shortcut to genuine understanding.  For now, at least, learning and building still feel best when I’m wrestling with the code myself.  Anyone else experiencing this with LLMs?
