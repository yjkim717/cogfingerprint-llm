**Summer Heat & Hidden Peace**

It’s 2024, and honestly, this summer heat is brutal. I’ve been wrestling with my concealed carry setup – mostly because my usual belt holster just *doesn’t* cut it when everything’s sticking to you.  I’ve been experimenting with belly bands and finding a surprisingly comfortable way to carry. It’s a little different, a little less obvious, but it gives me a sense of security without the bulk.  There’s something oddly satisfying about finding a tech-enabled solution to a very old-school need.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect (e.g., a particular holster type, or a more detailed reflection on the “tech-enabled” angle)?
