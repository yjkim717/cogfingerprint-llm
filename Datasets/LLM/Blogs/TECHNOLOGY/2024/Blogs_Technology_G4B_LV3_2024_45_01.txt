**The Glitch in My Dream – And What It Means for Our Reality**

It’s strange, isn’t it? How a single, vivid dream can linger, twisting itself into the edges of your waking life. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with this recurring dream – a relentless, primal fear of birds, coupled with a strange, heavy ring I keep finding in my hands. It feels… significant.

We live in 2024, completely immersed in augmented reality and simulated experiences. Maybe this dream, this unsettling connection to a “survival” scenario, is a subconscious reaction to that constant blurring of lines. Like a glitch in the system, it’s reminding me that there's something fundamentally real, something wild and untamed, that needs protecting. 

I'm starting to wonder if these digital worlds are craving a touch of the authentic, a reminder of the instincts buried deep within us – like the instinct to flee a flock of terrifying birds.
