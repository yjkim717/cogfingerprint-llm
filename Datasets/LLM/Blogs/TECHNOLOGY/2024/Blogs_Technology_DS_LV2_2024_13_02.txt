It’s 2024, and I’m sitting here thinking about how much technology has reshaped our sense of place. Just a few years ago, moving to a new city like Hong Kong felt like navigating a maze of paperwork—visa sponsorships, residency rules, endless requirements. Now, AI streamlines applications, and remote work platforms dissolve borders.

But here’s the twist: as tech untethers us, it also deepens our need for genuine connection. I can collaborate with teammates across time zones, yet I still crave the warmth of a shared coffee. Technology hasn’t just changed how we work; it’s reminded me that no algorithm can replace human presence. In this digital age, maybe home isn’t where your visa is stamped, but where your heart finds its rhythm.
