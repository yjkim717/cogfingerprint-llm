It’s funny how much of our lives orbit around invisible systems—algorithms, networks, and, for me, immigration statuses. In 2024, my world is a spreadsheet. Rows for STEM OPT, columns for H-1B lottery rounds, and one glaring, empty cell: employment authorization.

My OPT expired last month. My company believes in me, wants to keep me on—even without pay—while we await a potential second lottery. It’s a strange limbo, paid in hope and anxiety. I open my laptop daily, the same machine that built machine learning models, now mostly refreshing a single portal.

Technology connects us globally, yet my legal existence hinges on a digital lottery. I feel like background code, waiting for the main thread to call my name. It’s a quiet, personal battle fought in silence, a testament to how deeply our dreams are now intertwined with the systems we build.
