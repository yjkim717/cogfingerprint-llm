"Revisiting Fallout in 2024, I'm reminded that mods can be a double-edged sword. America Rising, a highly-touted Fallout mod, promised to breathe new life into the classic game. But with PRP and other mods, compatibility issues and FPS drops had me troubleshooting for hours. Still, the immersive experience was worth it - a testament to the power of community-driven content, even if it means navigating a few technical hiccups."
