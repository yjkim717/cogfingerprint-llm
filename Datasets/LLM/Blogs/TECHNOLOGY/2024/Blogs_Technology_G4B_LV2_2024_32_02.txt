**The Day My Tiny Server Broke My Heart**

It’s funny, isn’t it? We build these little digital worlds – my homelab’s a Lenovo Tiny workstation – and we treat them like precious things. Then, *bam* – a sudden RAM failure. It felt…personal. Like a tiny, digital betrayal. 

I started obsessing, checking everything else. Was the SSD next? It’s a reminder that even the most reliable tech can have a bad day. It’s also a humbling lesson about backups and preventative care.  Seriously, folks, don’t wait for the heartbreak! #homelab #serverhardware #tinyworkstation
