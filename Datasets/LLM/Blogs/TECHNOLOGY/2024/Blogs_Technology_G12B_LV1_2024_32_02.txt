## The Tiny Troubles of Big Work

It's funny how the smallest things can sometimes cause the biggest headaches. Recently, my Lenovo Tiny – a little powerhouse I use for some serious workstation tasks – decided to throw a RAM module tantrum. Just sputtered and died. Annoying, to say the least!

It got me thinking though, are these compact workstations, these little boxes packed with power, inherently more fragile? I’ve always appreciated their efficiency, the minimal footprint, but this failure sparked a little worry. I’m now looking at upgrading to a RAID 1 SSD setup for redundancy, and definitely scrutinizing the power supply more closely. 

It’s a reminder that even the most cleverly engineered tech isn’t invincible. And sometimes, the smallest components can really disrupt your workflow. Anyone else had similar experiences with their mini-workstations? Let me know!
