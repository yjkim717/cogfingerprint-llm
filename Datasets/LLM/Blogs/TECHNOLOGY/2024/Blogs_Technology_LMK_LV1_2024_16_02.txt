"As I stared at my website in 2024, I realized Amazon's recent update had left me scrambling. They'd removed their pre-made banners and image text, forcing me to get creative. I was determined to keep monetizing my site through Amazon's affiliate program. I dove into designing my own banners, experimenting with new tools and techniques. The result? A fresh, cohesive look that not only complied with Amazon's new rules but also elevated my site's overall aesthetic."
