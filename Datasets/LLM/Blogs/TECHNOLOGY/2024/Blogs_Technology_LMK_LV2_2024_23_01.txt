As I tuned into my favorite tech podcast in 2024, a listener's question caught my attention: "What does 'a good trip around the sun' mean?" The host's explanation revealed the idiom's origin and meaning, resonating with me as a non-native English speaker. Moments like these remind me of the power of language and technology to connect us, fostering understanding and community across cultures and borders, one podcast episode at a time.
