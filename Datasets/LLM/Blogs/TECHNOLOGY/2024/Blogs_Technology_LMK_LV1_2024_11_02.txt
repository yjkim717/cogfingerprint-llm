As I navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape in 2024, I'm pondering a crucial decision: where to register my domain. For a while, I've relied on Squarespace for its seamless integration of website building and domain management. However, I'm now exploring alternatives like DNSimple, Cloudflare, and Google Domains. What are the trade-offs between ease of use, pricing, and features? I'm seeking a service that balances simplicity with customization. Should I stick with Squarespace or switch to a more specialized domain registrar like DNSimple or Google Domains?
