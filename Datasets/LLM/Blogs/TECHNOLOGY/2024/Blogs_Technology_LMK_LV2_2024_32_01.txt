"Stuck in a Routing Loop: A Troubleshooting Tale"

As I sat staring at my screen in 2024, I couldn't help but feel a sense of déjà vu. I was troubleshooting a stubborn OSPF routing issue on one of our routers, Rtr P. The config looked good, OSPF broadcast traffic was flowing, but for some reason, it just wouldn't form neighbors with its peers. I double-checked the Layer 2 WAN config, verified the firewall rules, and even sniffed the traffic, but the problem persisted. It was as if Rtr P was stuck in a routing loop, unable to escape. I've been in this situation before, and I know that the solution often lies in the details. So, I'll dive back in, re-examine the config, and see if I can uncover the culprit behind this OSPF routing mystery. Sometimes, it's the most frustrating problems that teach us the most.
