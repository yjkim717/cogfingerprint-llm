As I sit here in 2024, surrounded by the glow of multiple screens, I'm reminded of how far technology has come. I recall my childhood fascination with a single, boxy computer in the living room. Now, I have a supercomputer in my pocket and a smart home that's, well, getting smarter by the day. It's astounding to think about how technology has woven itself into the fabric of our lives. As I look around, I wonder: are we enhancing our lives or just getting lost in the digital haze? The line is increasingly blurred.
