"Upgrading my home lab has been on my mind for months. As a tech enthusiast, I'm in need of a powerhouse that can handle virtualization, office tasks, and the occasional gaming session. I've been eyeing the Dell T5820 as a potential candidate for my next prebuilt workstation/server. Its expandable storage is a major draw. I'm looking for a system that can grow with my needs. Has anyone else out there built or purchased a similar setup? I'd love to hear your recommendations and learn from your experiences."
