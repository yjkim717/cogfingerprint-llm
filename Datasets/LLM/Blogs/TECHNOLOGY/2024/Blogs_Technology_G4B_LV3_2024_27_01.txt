It’s funny how quickly “new” becomes “normal,” isn’t it? Like Bard, the latest AI, feels almost…expected now. Just a few months ago, it was the shiny, revolutionary thing everyone was talking about. But now, it’s quietly becoming a tool – a really powerful one, granted – that enhances my own creativity. 

I’ve been experimenting with using it to brainstorm character concepts for my D&D campaign, and it’s unlocked some surprisingly interesting ideas. It’s like discovering a hidden ‘magical secret’ within the technology itself.  It’s a subtle boost to my initiative, pushing me to explore different paths, and sometimes, a little “bardic inspiration” when I’m stuck.
