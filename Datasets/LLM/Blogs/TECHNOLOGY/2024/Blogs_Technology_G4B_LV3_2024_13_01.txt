**The Ghost of Dim Sum**

There’s something incredibly strange about nostalgia fueled by a single, faded memory. I was scrolling through Reddit the other day, stumbling across a user desperately trying to pinpoint a Hong Kong restaurant from 2011 – a place they adored for its breakfast. It hit me hard.  We’re drowning in data now, in constant connection, yet these pockets of forgotten joy feel… fragile. 

Like that restaurant, a part of me feels a quiet uncertainty about the past, a yearning for a simpler time before algorithms dictated our memories.  It’s a reminder that even with all this tech, the most valuable connections are often the ones we hold onto with a little wistful longing.
