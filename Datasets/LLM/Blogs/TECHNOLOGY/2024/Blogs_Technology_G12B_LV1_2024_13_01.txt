## The Ghosts in My Photo Roll & the Power of a Decent OCR

It's weird how memory works, isn't it? I was scrolling through my phone the other day – a digital time capsule of a decade – and stumbled on a photo from Hong Kong, 2011. A blurry shot of a sign, promising delicious-looking milk tea and pastries. I *know* I went to this place, a little Kowloon Dairy somewhere, regularly back then. It was a refuge for a tired tourist!

But the name? Vanished. My brain’s a sieve. 

That's where Pleco came in. I ran the image through its OCR function (seriously, the advancements in those things are wild!), and after a few tries, *there it was*. "Kowloon Dairy." A small victory, but a surprisingly poignant one. 

It made me think about how technology isn't just about shiny new gadgets. Sometimes, it’s about rescuing fragments of our past, piecing together lost moments. It's about bringing back the taste of a forgotten milk tea and a feeling of being somewhere, somehow, long ago. Anyone else ever use tech to jog a memory like that?
