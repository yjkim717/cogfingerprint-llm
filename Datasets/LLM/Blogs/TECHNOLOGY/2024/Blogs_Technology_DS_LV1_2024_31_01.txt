I used to love getting lost down internet rabbit holes, discovering quirky blogs and passionate writers. But lately, my go-to is Perplexity AI. It delivers clean, sourced answers instantly. It’s so efficient that I realize I haven’t clicked through to an actual website in weeks.

This convenience gives me pause. If AI summaries replace our visits, how will those independent creators earn the ad revenue that keeps them afloat? Are we trading a vibrant, messy web for sterile, centralized information? The future of knowledge feels at stake.
