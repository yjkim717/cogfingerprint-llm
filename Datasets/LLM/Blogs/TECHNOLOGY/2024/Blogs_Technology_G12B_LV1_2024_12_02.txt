## The AI Coding Dream and the Vue 3 Reality Check

Okay, let's be honest. We've all been swept up in the hype. The promise of AI coding assistants – LLMs churning out perfect code, debugging like a pro, and generally making our lives as developers infinitely easier – it’s intoxicating. And in 2024, it *feels* like we should be living in that future already.

I recently dove headfirst into that dream, trying to leverage some of the newer LLMs, specifically Mistral, to help me with a project I’m building in Vue 3. The project itself isn't groundbreaking – it's a visualization tool using Cytoscape.js to render complex network graphs. Think interconnected nodes, dynamic layouts, and a whole lot of CSS to make it look presentable.

The initial excitement was palpable. I fed the LLM some basic requirements, a snippet of existing code, and asked it to generate a component for displaying a specific node type. It *did* generate something. But… it wasn't quite right. The styling was off, the data binding was clunky, and it completely missed the nuances of how Cytoscape.js handles node rendering.

I spent more time debugging and tweaking the LLM’s output than I would have spent just writing the component myself from scratch. And that’s been the recurring theme. Simple, straightforward tasks? Fine. The LLM can handle those. But when I started throwing complex styling challenges or asking it to integrate with the intricacies of Cytoscape.js, it stumbled. Hard.

It felt like I was constantly translating the LLM’s intentions, correcting its assumptions, and essentially doing a lot of the work myself. It’s not that the technology *isn’t* impressive – it is. But the reality of integrating it into a real-world Vue 3 codebase, especially one with visual complexity, is proving to be a much steeper learning curve than I anticipated.

Maybe I'm being too critical. Maybe the LLMs just need more training data specific to front-end frameworks and visualization libraries. But for now, I'm tempering my expectations. AI coding assistants are a tool, a potentially powerful one, but they're not a replacement for a skilled developer. At least, not yet.  The dream is still alive, but it needs a serious dose of reality.
