**Navigating the Tech Maze: My OPT Journey & Beyond**

It’s wild, isn’t it? 2024 and I’m still feeling like a tiny boat in a massive ocean of tech possibilities. My STEM OPT extension just wrapped up – a huge relief, honestly – and I’ve been staring down the barrel of what’s next.  

I’ve been researching like crazy, especially around the H1B lottery – that chaotic, hopeful draw.  It feels almost like a lottery, doesn't it?  Then there’s the SEVIS transfer process, a surprisingly complex dance.  

Honestly, I’m also starting to seriously explore options outside the US. Canada’s been popping up a lot, and the idea of a fresh start is… appealing. It’s a lot to process when your career feels so tied to this specific visa.  Anyone else feeling this slightly overwhelmed, yet strangely energized, by the possibilities?
