As I upgraded my smartphone in 2024, I couldn't help but think of my trusty old D&D campaign's bard character. Just like the latest dance bard subclass, this new phone is a game-changer - it's all about efficiency and supporting those around me. With AI-driven features and seamless multitasking, I can now stay connected with friends and family while still having the freedom to create. It's a subtle yet powerful boost, much like the bonus actions and team benefits that made my bard character shine on the battlefield.
