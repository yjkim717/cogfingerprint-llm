It was 2 AM when the security alert hit my phone: a sign-in from another continent. My heart sank. I use MFA, so how was this possible? The terrifying answer: a stolen authentication token, bypassing all my defenses. My immediate thought was to change my password, but would that even revoke the token? In our hyper-connected 2024 world, this digital violation made me question the very foundations of our online safety. Itâ€™s a chilling reminder that our digital lives are more fragile than they appear.
