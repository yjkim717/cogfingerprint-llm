## The Little Things That Annoy (and My Pixel Watch 2)

It’s 2024, and we’re *so* reliant on our tech. My shiny new Pixel Watch 2 was supposed to simplify things, but lately, it’s been a source of frustration. The battery’s draining ridiculously fast, even with bedtime mode and restarts! It’s a tiny annoyance, sure, but it highlights how much we expect from these little devices. Are we asking too much? Sometimes, I just crave a simpler existence, far from blinking screens and dwindling percentages.
