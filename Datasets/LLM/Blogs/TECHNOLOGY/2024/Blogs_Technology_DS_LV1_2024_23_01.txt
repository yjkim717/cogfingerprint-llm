It’s funny—I was listening to a podcast the other day and heard someone wish a friend “a good trip around the sun.” At first, I thought, "Wait, is that some new tech metaphor?" But no, it’s just a poetic way to say “happy birthday.” It got me thinking: in 2024, with AI and space tourism on the rise, maybe that phrase will one day mean a literal voyage. For now, I’ll stick to cake and candles—but who knows what next year’s trip will bring?
