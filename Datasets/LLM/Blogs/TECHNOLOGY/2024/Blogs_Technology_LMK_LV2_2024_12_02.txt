**The Dark Side of AI Assistance: My Frustrating Experience with LLMs for Coding**

As I sit here in 2024, surrounded by the latest advancements in AI technology, I'm reminded of the initial excitement I felt when I first started using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for coding tasks. It was supposed to be a game-changer â€“ a virtual assistant that could help me write cleaner code, faster. But, as it often does, reality had other plans.

My primary project at the time was building a complex application using Vue 3, and I was hoping that ChatGPT would be the perfect companion to help me navigate its intricacies. I fired up the chatbot, fed it my queries, and waited for the magic to happen. Unfortunately, what followed was a series of frustrating interactions that left me questioning the touted capabilities of AI assistance in programming.

The responses I received were often vague, sometimes incorrect, and occasionally, they even seemed to be addressing a different question altogether. I tried rephrasing my queries, providing more context, and even giving it explicit examples, but the results didn't improve significantly. It was as if I was trying to have a conversation with a well-intentioned but clueless colleague.

As the days went by, my initial enthusiasm gave way to disappointment. I began to wonder if I was simply using the wrong tool or if LLMs were just not as effective for coding tasks as I had been led to believe. The experience made me realize that, while AI has made tremendous progress, it's still far from being a reliable partner in complex programming tasks.

This journey has taught me a valuable lesson: while AI can be a powerful aid, it's not a replacement for human judgment and expertise. As we continue to integrate AI into our workflows, it's essential to understand its limitations and not rely solely on it for critical tasks. For now, I'm back to relying on my own coding skills, supplemented by good old-fashioned documentation and community forums. Maybe one day, LLMs will live up to the hype, but until then, I'll be taking their capabilities with a grain of salt.
