**The Tightrope Walk of Tech Dreams**

It’s 2024, and the tech world feels like a whirlwind, right? I’ve been watching a lot of conversations lately about navigating the complexities of staying in the game – specifically, as a STEM OPT student.  It really resonated with me, remembering my own early anxieties about visas and the future. 

Recently, I connected with someone facing a similar crossroads: a brilliant coder contemplating an H1B lottery, while simultaneously dreaming of a fresh start in Canada. The thought of juggling employment status, SEVIS transfers, and long-term goals felt…intense. 

There’s this constant pressure to build momentum, to prove your value. But it’s okay to pause, to explore all the possibilities.  It's a tightrope walk, balancing ambition with the need for stability.  What are *your* tech dreams looking like this year?
