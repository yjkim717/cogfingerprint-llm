It’s 2024, and when Google Domains shifted to Squarespace, I felt that familiar sysadmin dread. Suddenly, my trusted domain workflow was upended, especially for my .ca sites. I dove into research, weighing options like Cloudflare DNS and DNSimple. Each had its merits, but finding a registrar that handled .ca domains smoothly—without hidden fees or clunky interfaces—was the real challenge. It reminded me that in tech, even the basics we take for granted can change overnight, pushing us to adapt and rethink our digital foundations.
