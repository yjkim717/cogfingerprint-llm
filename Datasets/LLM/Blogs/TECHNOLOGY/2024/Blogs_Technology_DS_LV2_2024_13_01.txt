It’s funny how a single photo can send you tumbling back in time. The other day, I was scrolling through old pictures and found a blurry shot of a Hong Kong restaurant from 2011. I couldn’t read the Chinese sign, but I remembered something: my phone.

In 2024, we carry pocket-sized miracles. I opened Pleco, tapped the OCR feature, and pointed my camera. In seconds, the characters translated—Kowloon Dairy. Just like that, a forgotten memory had a name.

Technology often feels cold, but in moments like this, it’s a bridge. It didn’t just identify a restaurant; it pieced together a fragment of my past, reminding me how far we’ve come in connecting our worlds, pixel by pixel.
