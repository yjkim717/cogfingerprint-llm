**The Ghost in My Smart Home**

It’s weird, right? We’re so reliant on tech now – smart thermostats, security systems, even voice assistants. But sometimes, these digital layers feel… unsettling. I recently noticed a strange damp spot in my basement, a subtle clue my smart humidity sensor flagged. It triggered a memory of a previous owner’s patchy foundation repair – a hidden problem revealed by a gadget. It made me think about how much we trust these systems, and how easily they can expose vulnerabilities we’d rather ignore.  Maybe the future isn’t just about *building* smarter, but about understanding what’s *already* there.
