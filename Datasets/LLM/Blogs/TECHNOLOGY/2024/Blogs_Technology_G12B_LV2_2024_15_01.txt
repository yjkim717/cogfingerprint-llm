## Back to the Wasteland, and a Lesson in Digital Minimalism

Okay, so I'm restarting *Fallout 4*. Again. Don't judge! But this time, I'm approaching things differently. Usually, I’d just grab the massive Unofficial Patch – a glorious, community-built fix-all. But lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about digital clutter. 

It’s not just my desktop overflowing with icons, is it? It’s the sheer *weight* of plugins, extensions, and apps we pile onto everything. So, I’m going old school: individually selecting bug-fixing mods. It’s slower, more deliberate, and honestly, strangely satisfying. 

It’s a small thing, a game restart, but it’s mirroring a bigger shift. Less is more. A curated digital life. Maybe the wasteland isn't the only place that benefits from a little decluttering. Anyone else feeling this lately?
