**The Ghost in the Machine (and Why It Scared Me)**

Let me tell you, 2024 feels like a year of unraveling mysteries, and my IT setup was a particularly tangled one. I recently took over a project – and let’s just say the previous sysadmin had outsourced *everything* to an MSP. That’s great for some things, right? But the result was a baffling hybrid environment, a digital Frankenstein’s monster.

I started trying to tighten things up, wanting to bolster security, and one of the first things I tackled was password cycling. It felt…wrong. Like I was actively making things harder for people. So, I shifted to a passphrase system – longer, more complex, but hopefully more secure. 

Honestly, it’s been unsettling. It’s a reminder that technology isn’t always intuitive, and sometimes, the best solutions require a deep dive, a willingness to question the defaults, and a whole lot of patience.  It’s also a surprisingly humbling experience – a small reminder that even with all the tech in the world, a good understanding of *why* things are done is paramount.
