## Does Anyone Remember That Lifeline Line?

Anyone else feel like 2023 was…a lot? I was scrolling Reddit the other day and someone was asking about a specific Lifeline voice line in *Apex Legends* – one referencing a tough year. It got me thinking about how games capture these shared, fleeting moments of connection. Does it still exist? Did *anyone* else hear it? It's a small thing, but it felt surprisingly poignant.
