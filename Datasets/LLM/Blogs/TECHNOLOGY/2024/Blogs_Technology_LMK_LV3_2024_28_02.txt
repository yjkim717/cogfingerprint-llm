"As I navigate my double major in computer science and statistics at Berkeley, I'm constantly juggling course loads and seeking guidance from advisors. With tech advancements happening at breakneck speed in 2024, I'm driven to master both disciplines. By taking required lower-division courses simultaneously, I'm building a strong foundation in data analysis and programming. It's challenging, but I'm excited to combine these skills to tackle real-world problems and stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape."
