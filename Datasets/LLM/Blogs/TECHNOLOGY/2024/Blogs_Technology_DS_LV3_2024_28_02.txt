Balancing Data 8, CS 161, CS 170, and Math 53 this semester while adding a stats double major has been a whirlwind. My planner is a mosaic of deadlines, and some days, the sheer volume of work feels overwhelming. But in the quiet of the library at 2 AM, wrestling with a new algorithm, I find a strange clarity. It’s not just about checking boxes for a degree; it’s about building a foundation to understand the world through data. And that makes every late night worth it.
