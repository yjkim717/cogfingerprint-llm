## The Algorithm and My Lost Headphones (Again!)

Okay, seriously, does anyone else feel like technology is *actively* conspiring against them sometimes? I just spent a solid twenty minutes retracing my steps, convinced I’d lost my noise-canceling headphones – the ones I rely on for the chaotic bus rides between NYC and Ithaca (yes, I’m still battling the bus travel woes, apparently!). 

Turns out, they were tucked into a pocket I hadn’t checked. But the frantic search, the panicked mental inventory... it got me thinking. We put so much faith in these smart devices, these algorithms designed to streamline our lives. Yet, they often highlight our own absentmindedness in the most dramatic way possible. Maybe a little analog chaos is good for the soul? At least it’s a better story than another Trailways delay!
