## The Waiting Game & What's Next

It's a strange feeling, isn't it? My STEM OPT recently ended, and I'm in that limbo space – technically employed, but essentially waiting. The H1B lottery feels like a distant gamble, and I'm seriously exploring immigration to Canada. It's a lot to juggle! 

Honestly, the uncertainty is tough. I’m keeping busy, staying connected, and trying to focus on skills development. The tech world moves so fast; you can't afford to stand still. Anyone else navigating a similar situation? Sharing experiences helps – let's connect! #STEMOPT #H1BLottery #Immigration
