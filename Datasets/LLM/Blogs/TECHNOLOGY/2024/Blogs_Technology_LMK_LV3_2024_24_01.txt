The struggle is real - transitioning from CSGO to CS2. I've spent years perfecting my aim, developing muscle memory that feels second nature. But with CS2's subtick mechanic, my trusty flicks are now woefully off-target. It's like my brain and hands are speaking different languages. Every time I try to flick, I over or undershoot. It's infuriating. I've had to relearn the fundamentals, and it's humbling to be back to awkward, clunky movements. The subtick mechanic is a game-changer, but it's also a brutal teacher. As I grind aim training, I'm reminded that technology is constantly evolving - and sometimes, that means unlearning what we thought we knew. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I'm determined to adapt and come out on top in CS2.
