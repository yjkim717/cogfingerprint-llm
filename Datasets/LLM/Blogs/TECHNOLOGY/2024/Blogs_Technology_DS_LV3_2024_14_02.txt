Ever tried fine-tuning with Kohya in 2024? I dove in, armed with enthusiasm, only to hit a wall of cryptic training errors. Scouring the web for guides felt like wandering in a maze—everyone assumes you’ve mastered the metadata setup already. It’s frustrating when the tools promise creativity but the process tests your patience. Still, each stumble taught me something. Maybe that’s the real training: not just tweaking models, but learning resilience through tech’s tough love.
