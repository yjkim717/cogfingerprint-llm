It’s 2024, and I’m still tidying up my cloud resources like digital housekeeping. I’d been using Oracle Cloud’s generous free tier for months, spinning up instances for quick experiments. But I only recently noticed: terminating an instance doesn’t automatically delete its boot volume. Orphaned storage was silently eating my free allowance. A quick cleanup of those lingering volumes reclaimed precious space. It’s a small reminder that in the cloud, what’s out of sight shouldn’t be out of mind. A little maintenance goes a long way.
