Navigating cancer treatment in 2024, my family found solace in technology. Virtual support groups connected us with others facing similar challenges, while telemedicine appointments eased the financial burden of frequent hospital visits. Online resources helped us understand treatment options and manage caregiving responsibilities. As we coped with the complexities of cancer care, technology became a lifeline, providing emotional support and practical solutions during a difficult time.
