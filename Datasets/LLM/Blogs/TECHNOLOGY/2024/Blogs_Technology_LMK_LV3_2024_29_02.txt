The C3 language is finally taking shape. With the recent 0.5.4 release, I'm excited to see how this promising programming language will evolve. As new users dive in, they're not just testing its capabilities - they're helping shape its future. Bug detection and user feedback are invaluable in refining the software. It's a great example of how collaborative development can lead to better outcomes. I'm looking forward to seeing how C3 will continue to improve and what it will enable developers to create in 2024 and beyond.
