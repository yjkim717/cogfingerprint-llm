## That Frustrating Feeling When Games Change

Ugh, anyone else feel a little gutted when a game you love gets a patch and suddenly something *just isn't right*? I was happily gathering resources in IdleOn the other day, enjoying those gold bonuses, and then…wham! My carry capacity seemed slashed, and items were vanishing. It’s a small thing, sure, but it really threw off my flow. Makes you wonder how these little tweaks impact the overall experience, doesn't it?
