## The Hum of the Machine & My Child's Lungs

This Utah winter has been rough. Every year, it feels like a cycle: inversion hangs heavy, sniffles start, and my little one catches *something*. This year, I’m hyper-aware. It's not just the usual flu season; it's the feeling that the air itself is contributing. 

I’ve been researching air quality tech – humidifiers, purifiers, the whole shebang. It's fascinating how much we rely on these digital helpers to combat environmental challenges, even something as simple as breathing easy. Makes you wonder what future winters hold.
