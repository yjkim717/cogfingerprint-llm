It’s 2024, and I’ve realized my phone has turned me into a digital spare ticket.

I used to think I was popular—my screen lighting up with invites to virtual game nights, group streams, and collaborative playlists. But lately, it feels hollow. I’m the +1 in group chats, the filler friend invited to round out numbers, not for meaningful connection. My friends and I are "together" online, but we’re just sharing space, not stories.

Technology promised to bring us closer, yet I’ve never felt more like a background character in someone else’s social feed. We’ve traded deep conversations for reaction emojis, and real presence for passive participation. It’s as if I’m a seat warmer, keeping a spot occupied until something better comes along.

So, I’m stepping back. No more accepting every digital invite out of FOMO. I’m choosing to prioritize real interactions—even if they’re fewer. Because friendship shouldn’t feel like being a placeholder.
