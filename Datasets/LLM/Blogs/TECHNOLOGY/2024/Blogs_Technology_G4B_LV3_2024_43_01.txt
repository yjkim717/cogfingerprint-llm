**The Tightrope Walk of Next.js Logic**

It’s wild how quickly things change in tech, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter about shoving database logic *directly* into Next.js server components. The promise is alluring – lightning-fast prototyping, less hand-off between frontend and backend… it feels like a developer’s dream. 

But there’s a nagging feeling, a little voice reminding me that this approach can quickly become a tangled mess. While it might be brilliant for a small project, what happens when you need to scale? Suddenly, monitoring becomes a nightmare, and that tight coupling you initially avoided starts to strangle your architecture. 

I’m wrestling with this myself, trying to balance the immediate gains with the long-term health of a project.  It’s a delicate dance – embracing the power of Next.js while keeping a watchful eye on the bigger picture.
