**The Swipe and the Silence**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we build these digital walls. I was scrolling through dating apps last night – just mindless swiping, really – and it hit me: I’m terrified of *really* connecting. It’s a strange vulnerability, admitting that. 

I crave that messy, awkward, *real* intimacy that movies promise, but the thought of showing my true self, of letting someone see the quiet corners of my anxieties, feels… overwhelming.  It’s like I’ve built a fortress around my heart, reinforced with filters and carefully curated online personas. 

I caught myself reaching for a porn video, not for pleasure, but as a way to avoid the potential discomfort of genuine interaction.  It’s a sad cycle, isn’t it?  A desperate attempt to feel something, anything, without the risk of feeling *seen*.  Maybe it’s time to dismantle a few of those walls, brick by digital brick.
