"As I listened to my favorite podcast last week, I stumbled upon a phrase that left me puzzled - 'another good trip around the sun.' I'm a non-native English speaker, and I turned to Urban Dictionary for clarity. It turns out, it's an idiom referring to a birthday! Native English speakers often use it to wish someone a happy birthday. In 2024, technology has made it easier to learn and understand expressions like these, bridging language gaps one podcast at a time."
