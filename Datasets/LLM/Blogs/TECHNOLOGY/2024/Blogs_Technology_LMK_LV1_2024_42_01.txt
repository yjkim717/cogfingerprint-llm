"Upgrading to ChromeOS Flex 128 on my trusty Fujitsu laptop seemed like a great idea in 2024, but boy, was I wrong! After the update, my touchpad started acting wonky. The cursor would vanish every time I closed the lid, leaving me stuck. I've tried tweaking settings, but the issue persists. Has anyone else experienced this frustrating glitch? I'm starting to wonder if ChromeOS Flex is the right fit for my old laptop."
