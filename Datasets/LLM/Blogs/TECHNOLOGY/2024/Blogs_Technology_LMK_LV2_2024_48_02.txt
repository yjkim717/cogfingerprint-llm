"Stuck in the Dark: My Frustrating Experience with Project Zomboid's Lighting"

As I dove back into Project Zomboid on my Intel Mac in 2024, I was excited to survive in the zombie-infested world once again. However, my enthusiasm was short-lived. The game's darkness and lighting issues kicked in, making it challenging to navigate and enjoy the gameplay. The poor visibility was not just frustrating; it was a survival hazard. I found myself stumbling upon zombies or getting lost in the dark, which wasn't the game's intention, I'm sure. The lack of proper lighting made the experience more stressful than immersive. I'm not alone in this struggle, as many players have reported similar issues. It's time for the developers to shine some light on this problem. Until then, I'll be stuck in the dark, waiting for a fix that'll let me enjoy the game as intended.
