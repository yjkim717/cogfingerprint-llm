## Beyond the Algorithm: Rethinking How We Connect (and Sell)

Okay, let's be honest, how many of us are *still* chasing the Facebook ad dragon? I know I was. My small sustainable clothing brand poured a lot into targeted ads last year, but 2024 feels…different. The algorithm shifted again, and suddenly, those carefully crafted campaigns weren’t delivering. Plus, organic brand searches? Practically non-existent.

It got me thinking. Are we relying too heavily on these platforms to do the work *for* us? I've been exploring alternatives – partnering with smaller, genuine influencers who actually *live* the sustainable lifestyle, crafting engaging email campaigns that feel like a conversation, and even experimenting with branded search terms to capture those genuinely interested shoppers.

It's slower, definitely more hands-on, but there's a realness to it that felt missing before. It’s about building a community, not just blasting ads. I'm learning that connecting authentically, even if it's a little less flashy, might just be the key to long-term growth – and a little sanity along the way.



Hope this fits the bill!
