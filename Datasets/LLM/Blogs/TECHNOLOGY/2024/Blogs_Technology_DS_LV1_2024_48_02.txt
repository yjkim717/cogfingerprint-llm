### The Digital Darkness

It’s funny how a video game can make you think about your own tech. I was playing Project Zomboid the other night, fumbling for the light switch in a virtual house and squinting at an impossibly dark road. I get it—darkness is the point, a core part of the challenge. But it got me reflecting on a different kind of darkness I’ve been wrestling with.

I recently dusted off my old Intel Mac. Firing it up felt like trying to read by candlelight after years of using a modern, bright LED desk lamp. The performance gap is staggering. In 2024, with AI integrations and seamless workflows becoming the standard, using that older machine is its own kind of "low visibility." It’s not broken, but it forces you to navigate menus and processes that feel dim and sluggish compared to the instant, illuminated clarity of current tech.

Both experiences taught me the same lesson: there’s a fine line between a meaningful challenge and just poor visibility. Whether it’s a game mechanic or a processor, sometimes you need a better light source not to cheat, but to actually engage with the world in front of you.
