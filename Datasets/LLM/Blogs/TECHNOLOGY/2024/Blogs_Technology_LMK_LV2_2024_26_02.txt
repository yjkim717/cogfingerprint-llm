"As I ponder my latest ITX build, I'm reminded that flexibility is key in the ever-evolving world of PC hardware. I recently found myself swapping out a perfectly good RX 5600 graphics card, simply because my build plans changed. The card's 3x fan cooler, while impressive, was just too long for my new setup. It's experiences like these that make me appreciate the second-hand market - someone's unwanted hardware is another's treasure. I snagged a great deal on the card, and it's now available for $95 shipped. Sometimes, change can be a good thing."
