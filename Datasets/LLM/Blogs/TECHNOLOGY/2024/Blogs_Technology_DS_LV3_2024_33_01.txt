It’s funny—I thought terminating my Oracle Free Tier instance meant I’d tidied everything up. But weeks later, I noticed my storage was still full. Turns out, the boot volume was hanging around like digital clutter, quietly taking up space. It’s a small detail, but in 2024, every gigabyte counts. Deleting it felt like finally closing a browser tab I’d left open for months. A gentle reminder: in the cloud, even “done” isn’t always done.
