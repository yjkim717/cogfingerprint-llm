"Frustration on the Road: When Fahrschule Communication Fails"

As I sat in my Theorie-stunden, eagerly waiting to receive my stundenplan, I couldn't help but feel a growing sense of frustration. Despite multiple requests, my fahrschule seemed to be in no hurry to share my lesson plan. In this digital age, it's astonishing that communication can still be so... human. I mean, we're in 2024, and you'd think that sending a simple stundenplan would be a breeze. But nope, it seems like some fahrschules are still stuck in the dark ages. The Pflichtstunden were ticking away, and I was left in limbo, unsure of what to expect. It's a stark reminder that technology can only take us so far if the humans behind it aren't on the same page. Has anyone else had a similar experience with their fahrschule? How did you handle it?
