There’s something deeply satisfying about setting up your own corner of the internet. Last week, I stood before a blank slate—a brand new VPS, its virtual doors wide open, ready for me to build upon. My goal was simple: get a WordPress site up and running. But the path forward? That was the real question, one I’ve been wrestling with ever since.

Do I go the modern route and containerize everything with **Docker**? The appeal is undeniable. Isolated environments, easy replication, and that clean, portable architecture feel like the future of **self-hosting**. I could almost hear the purr of a perfectly orchestrated system. But then, the old-school tinkerer in me whispers about the raw control of a direct installation. No abstraction layers, just my server, a LEMP stack (**Nginx** humming at the front), and me. It’s the digital equivalent of knowing every bolt in a classic car engine.

I’ve spent evenings deep in forums, weighing the streamlined elegance of containers against the grounded certainty of a traditional setup. The Docker route promises scalability and a certain peace of mind; if something breaks, I can just rebuild the container. But the direct install feels more… intimate. It’s a deeper connection to the machine, a learning process etched into its very file system.

So here I am, the blank admin dashboard of my VPS staring back, a silent judge. This isn’t just a technical decision anymore; it’s a philosophical one about how I want to interact with my own digital space. Do I embrace the convenience of the new or the mastery of the classic? I suspect many of you have stood at this same crossroads. What path did you take, and why?
