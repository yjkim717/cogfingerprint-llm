## The Lingering Ghost of `Send-MailMessage` and the March of Progress

It’s funny how technology leaves these little echoes behind, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a persistent problem in our onboarding scripts – sending email notifications. Seems simple enough, right? But we’re still seeing folks clinging to the `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet in PowerShell. 

And that's a bit of a worry. Microsoft has been pretty clear: it’s obsolete. It's like using a flip phone in 2024 – technically it *works*, but it's got serious security vulnerabilities and just feels… outdated. 

We’ve been migrating to using `Send-Mail` with a proper SMTP server connection, and the difference is night and day. Not just in security (that's a *huge* win), but also in flexibility. Suddenly, we can handle authentication properly, customize headers, and even integrate with more sophisticated email platforms.

It’s a reminder that even in the world of scripting and automation, we can't get complacent. There’s always a newer, better, *safer* way to do things. Sometimes, the toughest part isn't finding those new ways, but convincing everyone to let go of the old ones.  It's a slow process, but it’s a necessary one.
