## The Pixel Watch 2 Battery Blues: Anyone Else Feeling This?

Okay, tech friends, I need to vent! My brand-new Pixel Watch 2, which I was *so* excited about, has taken a serious nosedive in battery life. Like, overnight. I’m diligently using bedtime mode, but still, it’s draining faster than ever. Anyone else experiencing this sudden change in 2024? It’s frustrating, and I’m hoping we can troubleshoot together – because right now, it feels like I'm tethered to a charger again!
