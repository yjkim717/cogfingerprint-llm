Just when I thought my trusty Fujitsu laptop was running smoother than ever with ChromeOS Flex, the latest system update threw me a curveball. Now, every time I close and reopen the lid, my touchpad goes rogue—the cursor vanishes into thin air. It’s a small glitch, but it’s these little tech hiccups in 2024 that remind me how reliant we’ve become on seamless digital experiences. Thank goodness for my backup mouse keeping me grounded—and clicking.
