"As I navigated Revolut's app in 2024, I was frustrated to find that Lufthansa airline miles weren't an option for redeeming RevPoints. It made me wonder, what's the point of accumulating rewards if you can't use them with your preferred airline? I hope Revolut takes user feedback seriously and expands its redemption options. Until then, I'll be stuck with limited choices, a reminder that even the most innovative fintechs can fall short."
