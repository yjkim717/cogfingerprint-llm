**The Quiet Swipe: When Connection Feels… Distant**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we can build a connection with someone across the internet, a fleeting exchange of emojis and GIFs. Lately, I’ve been noticing a strange disconnect for me, a subtle sense of detachment creeping in, even as I’m *constantly* connected. 

I’ve been wrestling with this feeling alongside a deeper exploration of my own sexuality – a hesitant curiosity mixed with a surprising aversion. It’s not about wanting *less* intimacy, but feeling profoundly vulnerable when I actually try to engage with it. 

I’ve found myself turning to things like exploring erotica online, a digital comfort zone, while simultaneously working with a therapist to unpack some bigger emotional roadblocks. It feels a little… paradoxical, doesn’t it? Like using technology to build walls instead of bridges.  Maybe the key isn't to ditch the screen entirely, but to be more mindful about *how* we’re using it to seek – and build – genuine connection.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a particular aspect (like the therapy angle, or the use of erotica) or aiming for a slightly different tone?
