It’s 2024, and I still think about the Fortnite pros who tried to make it big in Valorant. I remember watching them—the same players who dominated build battles and clutch moments—struggle to find their footing in a game that demanded entirely new skills. For many, the transition from one esports giant to another wasn’t just a change of game; it felt like starting over.

Some gave competitive Valorant their all, but the results were often quiet exits and leaderboards that didn’t carry their names. Most ended up turning to streaming, trading the pressure of tournaments for the connection of a live audience. It’s a reminder that in tech and gaming, even top-tier talent faces reinvention. Success isn’t always about staying on top—sometimes, it’s about knowing when to pivot and build something new.
