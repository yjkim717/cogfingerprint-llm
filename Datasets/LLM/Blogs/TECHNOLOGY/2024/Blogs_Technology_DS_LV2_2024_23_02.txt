It’s 2024, and I’m still amazed at how my phone can guide me anywhere, yet I got hopelessly lost in Copenhagen last week. My GPS failed, and I ended up wandering into a tiny shop selling refurbished bikes—no app, just handwritten signs and the scent of old leather.

It reminded me that technology connects us globally, but it’s the unplanned, human moments that truly orient us. Sometimes, getting lost is the best way to find what you didn’t know you were looking for.
