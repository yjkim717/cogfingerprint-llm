It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking about how technology lets us witness growth in real time. Take Natty, for example—I first saw her on *Sixteen* years ago, then followed her solo work, and now she’s debuting as the main dancer in Kiss of Life. It’s Momo-level inspiring! 

In a way, tech platforms have become our digital scrapbooks, chronicling journeys like hers and letting us cheer from the sidelines. It’s not just about talent; it’s about connection. Watching someone evolve through screens makes their success feel like our own little victory. Here’s to the tools that bring dreams—and dancers—closer to us all.
