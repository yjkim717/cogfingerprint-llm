**The Ghost in My Walls (and a Little Tech Anxiety)**

Seriously, guys, this week felt…weird. I was stripping back some old wallpaper in my hallway when I found this weird, damp patch behind the drywall. It’s triggering a full-blown “foundation anxiety” spiral – imagining hidden cracks, maybe even mold.  It made me think about how much our lives are built on unseen problems, just like that basement wall.  And then I started wondering if *I’m* building my life too heavily on algorithms and digital ghosts.  Maybe a little more real-world connection is needed? 😅 #techreflection #homeissues #2024life
