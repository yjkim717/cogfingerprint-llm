**The Uncomfortable DM**

Okay, so, this happened last week, and honestly, it’s been swirling around in my head ever since. I’m a sysadmin – basically, I keep the servers running at my company. My job is all about logic, protocols, and keeping things secure. It’s not exactly a profession that lends itself to deep emotional conversations. 

Then Sarah, a colleague in marketing, started texting me. Casual stuff at first – sharing a funny meme, commenting on a project. But then it shifted. She started dropping these incredibly detailed snippets about her life, her relationships, her… well, her sexuality. It wasn’t malicious, not exactly, but it felt *invasive*. 

I found myself really questioning her. Why was she sharing this? Was it a genuine attempt at connection, or something else entirely? It threw me for a loop. As a sysadmin, I’m hyper-aware of data privacy – I build firewalls and secure systems. Yet, here I was, feeling completely exposed by a simple string of texts. 

It made me think about how we’re all so connected through technology, but that doesn’t automatically mean we *should* be sharing everything.  It’s a weird reminder that even in the digital age, boundaries still matter.  Anyone else experienced something similar?
