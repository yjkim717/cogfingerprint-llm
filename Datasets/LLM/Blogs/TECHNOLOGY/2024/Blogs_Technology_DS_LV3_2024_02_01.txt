### The Digital Ghost in the Machine

You know that feeling when you move into a new house, and you keep finding odd quirks left by the previous owner? A switch that doesn’t seem to do anything, a cabinet that sticks in just one spot. That’s exactly what it felt like inheriting our hybrid environment last year.

On the surface, everything was running. But every time I tried to push us forward—to implement modern security like Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) or finally allow strong passphrases—something invisible would push back. Tickets would fail, policies would conflict, and users would get stuck in a maddening loop of password cycling. It was like a digital ghost was haunting our Azure AD, determined to keep us in the past.

The culprit, I eventually discovered, was our former MSP. In their well-intentioned effort to lock things down, they had layered on policies with a heavy hand, creating a tangled web of permissions. Their legacy was a set of invisible walls blocking the very modern authentication practices we needed. Entra ID was ready, but these ghost configurations were the gatekeepers.

Untangling this wasn’t just a technical fix; it was an archaeological dig. It forced me to understand the "why" behind every setting, to respectfully dismantle what was no longer serving us. The moment I cleared that final conflict and saw our first SSPR success email, it wasn’t just a win for security. It was a lesson in digital stewardship. Our infrastructure isn't just a system; it's a story, and we have to understand the old chapters before we can write the new, more secure ones.
