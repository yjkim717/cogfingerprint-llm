**Ghosts in the Wiring: My Quest for a Reliable Home Network**

Let’s be honest, tech can feel a little… impersonal sometimes, right? But it’s also deeply connected to our lives, our routines, and even our homes. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a frustrating problem – a patchy internet connection in my old Victorian house. It’s beautiful, full of character, but apparently, its wiring isn’t thrilled about modern demands. 

Specifically, I’m trying to figure out how to boost the signal using Moca adapters and coax cable – essentially, bringing the internet *through* the existing coax lines. It’s a bit like trying to coax a stubborn old ghost to cooperate! 

Working from home (Wfh) is a huge part of my life now, and a stable connection is non-negotiable. This whole process has made me appreciate the hidden infrastructure humming beneath my walls, and the surprising amount of ingenuity needed to make it all work. Wish me luck – I’m determined to banish those internet ghosts!
