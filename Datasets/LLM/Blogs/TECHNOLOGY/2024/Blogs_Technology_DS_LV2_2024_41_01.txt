It’s 2024, and I’ve officially become the unofficial IT person in my own home. You know the feeling—that moment when you’re staring at a weak Wi-Fi signal upstairs, trying to join a video call, and your router downstairs feels miles away. I’d heard whispers about MoCA adapters, those clever little boxes that turn your home’s existing coax ports into internet superhighways.

So, armed with curiosity and a healthy dose of skepticism, I dove in. I dug out an old cable splitter, plugged one adapter near the router, another upstairs, and just like that—my office came alive. No more dead zones, no more lag. It felt like discovering a secret passage in my own house.

It’s funny how the simplest tech can feel revolutionary. In a world obsessed with wireless everything, sometimes the best solution is already wired into our walls, quietly waiting for us to reconnect.
