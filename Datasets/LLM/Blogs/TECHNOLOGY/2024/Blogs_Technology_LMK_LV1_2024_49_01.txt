"As I dove into LeetCode problems in 2024, I found myself caught in a productivity paradox. Hours flew by as I tackled algorithm challenges, feeling a rush of satisfaction with each solved problem. Yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being unproductive, sacrificing precious time that could be spent on other pursuits. Was I honing my coding skills or simply indulging in a digital puzzle? I realized that the line between practice and obsession is thin, and it's up to me to strike a balance between improving my craft and maintaining a healthy work-life balance."
