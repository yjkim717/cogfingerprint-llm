>## The Algorithm and the Overseas Dream: A Hong Kong Job Hunt Reflection

So, I've been staring at my laptop screen a *lot* lately. Specifically, at Hong Kong job postings. It's a little surreal, honestly. I'm already here on a QMAS visa, a testament to skills-based immigration, which felt like a huge win. But then the question popped up â€“ does not having permanent residency impact my job search? It's a surprisingly common concern in expat circles.

It made me think about how much we rely on algorithms these days. Do companies filter applications based on residency status? Is it visible? It feels a bit impersonal, doesn't it? Navigating this, alongside the usual job-hunting anxieties, is definitely a learning curve. Hopefully, proving my worth through my experience will outweigh any automated hurdles. Anyone else feeling this digital job-seeking pressure?
