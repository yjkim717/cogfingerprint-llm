As I stared at my smartphone in 2024, I couldn't help but think of my vocal journey. Just like struggling to switch from mixed voice to falsetto, I found myself torn between the ease of AI-generated content and my own creativity. With AI tools at my fingertips, I felt a strain on my imagination, much like the tension on my vocal chords. But I took a deep breath, put down the device, and let my thoughts flow. Sometimes, it's in the silence that we find our true voice â€“ and our best ideas.
