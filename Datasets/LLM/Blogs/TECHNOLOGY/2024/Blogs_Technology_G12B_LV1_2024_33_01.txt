>## The Ghost Storage of the Cloud

It’s 2024, and we’re all juggling cloud resources. I recently stumbled into a classic head-scratcher while playing around with Oracle’s Free Tier – a fantastic resource for tinkering, by the way. I terminated an instance, expecting the storage to vanish with it. Simple, right? 

Not quite.

My dashboard stubbornly showed a chunk of space still consumed. After a bit of digging, I realized the leftover storage was clinging to a detached boot volume, orphaned after the instance’s demise. It was a small amount, but enough to be annoying. 

It's a stark reminder that the cloud isn't always as immediately responsive as we’d like. It highlights the importance of double-checking, of understanding the lifecycle of cloud components. A simple termination doesn't always mean complete deletion. It’s a little lesson in cloud hygiene – a proactive approach to keep those bills (and sanity) in check!



Hope this helps!
