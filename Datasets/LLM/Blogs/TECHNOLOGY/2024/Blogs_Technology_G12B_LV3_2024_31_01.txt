## Is Our Free Web About to Disappear? A Thought I Can't Shake.

Lately, I've been using Perplexity AI a *lot*. It's incredible, right? Instant answers, distilled informationâ€¦ it's genuinely a game-changer. But a nagging thought keeps circling: what happens to the websites that *feed* this AI? 

So much of the web thrives on ad revenue, supporting independent blogs, niche publications, and creators who offer unique perspectives. If we increasingly turn to AI for our information, will those sites survive? Will the diverse voices and specialized knowledge they hold vanish? It's a big question, and one I think we all need to consider as AI rapidly reshapes how we consume information in 2024.
