## The Algorithm and the Storyteller

Remember when we all thought AI would *help* creativity? Like, a super-powered brainstorming buddy? Lately, I’m feeling a bit… uneasy. It’s not the AI itself, but the speed at which things are being churned out, prioritizing quantity over quality.

I saw it play out recently with that new animated series, *Ark*. The initial hype was massive, but the execution? Let’s just say it felt rushed, like corners were cut to meet a deadline. And it got me thinking about how this pressure applies everywhere – from streaming content to, honestly, even how we interact online. 

Suddenly, everything feels…co-opted. Like the core message gets diluted, reshaped to appeal to the widest possible audience. I miss the days when a story felt carefully considered, patiently crafted. Maybe I’m just getting old, but I hope we don't lose the art of thoughtful creation in the relentless pursuit of algorithmic approval.
