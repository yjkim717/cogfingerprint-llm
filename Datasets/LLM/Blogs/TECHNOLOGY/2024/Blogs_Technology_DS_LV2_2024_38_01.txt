It’s 2024, and I’m still chasing that elusive “aha!” moment in topic modeling. I spent hours tweaking my LDA parameters in Gensim and Scikit-learn, hoping to glimpse signs of convergence as the model iterated. But it felt like flying blind—no easy way to watch the metrics evolve, no satisfying confirmation that my topics were truly stabilizing.

It reminded me that in our rush toward AI efficiency, we sometimes overlook the simple need to observe and understand. Maybe the next breakthrough isn’t just smarter algorithms, but tools that let us journey alongside them, learning as they learn.
