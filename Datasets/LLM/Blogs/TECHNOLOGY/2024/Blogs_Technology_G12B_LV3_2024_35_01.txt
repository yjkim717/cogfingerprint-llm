It's 2024, and we're more connected than ever, yet sometimes the digital world feels miles away from what truly matters.

And then I thought about how technology, often a source of distraction, can also be a lifeline. Video calls bridging distance, online support groups offering solace, apps tracking medications – small digital tools offering a glimmer of connection and control amidst immense uncertainty. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest times, a screen can sometimes offer a vital bridge.
