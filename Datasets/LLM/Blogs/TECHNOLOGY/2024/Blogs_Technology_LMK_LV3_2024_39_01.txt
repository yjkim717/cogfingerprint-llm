"I was excited to redeem my RevPoints for Lufthansa flights, but was surprised to find they weren't supported. As I dug deeper, I realized that even with fintech advancements in 2024, airline partnerships can be a complex issue. It's frustrating when rewards programs don't live up to expectations. Perhaps it's time for Revolut to revisit their airline collaborations and make travel more seamless for users."
