"As I navigated my VMware Horizon renewal in 2024, I was relieved to find the pricing fit within my budget. The shift to a SaaS subscription model not only simplified my costs but also reduced my expenses. With a universal license and vSphere integration, I was able to streamline my virtual infrastructure. The per-user, per-month cost was a pleasant surprise - a more affordable path forward for my organization's virtual desktop needs."
