"I still can't believe I was right about the Ark animated series. Back in 2022, I predicted it would flop due to its poor storytelling and character coopting. Fast forward to 2024, and it's clear my concerns were valid. The show's attempt at inclusive storytelling fell flat, and the characters feel more like caricatures than real people. As someone who's passionate about tech and animation, it's disheartening to see such potential wasted. The Ark series is a cautionary tale of how not to adapt a beloved franchise for the modern audience."
