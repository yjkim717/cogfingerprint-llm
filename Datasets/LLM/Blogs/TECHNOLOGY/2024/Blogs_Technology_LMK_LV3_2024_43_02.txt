"Embracing the Future of AI: Why I'm Opening Up Our API Gateway". As we dive into 2024, I'm excited to open-source our managed API gateway and client libraries for AI services, built with Kotlin. By sharing our work under the MIT license, I invite the community to join forces and shape the future of AI integration. This collaboration will not only accelerate innovation but also foster a culture of shared knowledge and expertise. Together, let's unlock the full potential of AI and create a brighter tech landscape.
