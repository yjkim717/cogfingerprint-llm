The struggles of upgrading to CS2. As someone who's spent over 5,000 hours honing my CSGO skills, I thought I was prepared for the transition. But boy, was I wrong. The subtick mechanic threw me off guard, and my trusty flicking technique suddenly felt like a liability. It's been a humbling experience, to say the least. My muscle memory, once so finely tuned, now feels like a hindrance. I've been struggling to adjust my aim, and it's been frustrating to say the least. It's a harsh reminder that, even with years of practice, we're still at the mercy of the technology we use. As I continue to adapt to CS2, I'm reminded that the pursuit of improvement is a never-ending journey. And sometimes, it takes a step back to move forward. Will I get back to my old self soon? Only time will tell.
