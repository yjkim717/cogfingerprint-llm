**Seriously, My Horizon Costs Less Now?**

Okay, real talk. As anyone who’s wrestled with IT budgets knows, VMware Horizon renewals can feel like a monster. I just went through the process this month, and I’m still reeling! I managed to snag a seriously fantastic deal – switching to a SaaS subscription actually saved me a *ton* of money.
