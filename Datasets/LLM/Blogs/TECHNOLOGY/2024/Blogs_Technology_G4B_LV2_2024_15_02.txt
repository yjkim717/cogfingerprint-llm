**Lost in the Wasteland (of My Own Game)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we pour ourselves into these digital worlds. Right now, I’m utterly consumed by Fallout 4, specifically trying to weave together the America Rising mod with some PRP elements. It’s… chaotic. I’m currently stuck in Boston, battling glitches and a stubbornly persistent enclave. 

There’s something deeply satisfying about wrestling with a complex system, like trying to make this retro game feel fresh. It’s a frustrating, beautiful mess – a little bit like life, really.  Anyone else get lost in their hobbies?
