**The Quiet Comfort of a Connected Screen**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we’ve become so reliant on screens. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about that reliance, especially when I picture my dad’s recent experience. He was diagnosed with lung cancer, and navigating the treatment – the appointments, the worry – it was… overwhelming. 

But then, there was a small, unexpected comfort. A video call with his granddaughter. Seeing her face, hearing her giggle, it was a tiny crack of light in a really dark time.  

We used telehealth for so many consultations, which felt both amazing and a little isolating. It’s a testament to technology, really. It can't replace a hug, but it *can* keep us connected when distance and hardship make it hard.  It’s a reminder that even in the most challenging moments, there’s still a way to bridge the gap.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post focused on a different aspect of technology and caregiving?
