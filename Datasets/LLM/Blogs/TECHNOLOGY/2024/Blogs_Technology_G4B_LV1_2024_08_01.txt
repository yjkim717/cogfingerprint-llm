**Scrolling Through Connections, Feeling… Distant?**

Okay, real talk. It’s 2024, and I’m starting to feel a little weird about how “social” we’ve become. Like, I’ll get a flurry of DMs after posting a story, but it’s mostly just likes and fleeting emojis. Remember when a genuine invitation to *do* something felt… different? 

Recently, a friend started offering to send me spare tickets to events – super kind, I know. But honestly, it felt a little passive. I crave real interaction, you know? Not just being *present* while someone else is scrolling. 

I’m realizing that all this digital connection isn’t necessarily filling the need for actual friendship and socializing. Maybe I need to actively seek out those deeper conversations, those shared experiences that aren’t filtered through a screen.  Anyone else feeling this?
