**The Unexpected Power of Beginner Bugs**

You know that feeling when you’re wrestling with a new tech tool, utterly lost and frustrated? I’ve been diving deep into C3 lately – a really interesting language with a surprisingly active community – and it’s been…well, a learning experience.

Honestly, those initial frustrations? They’re proving invaluable.  It’s amazing to realize that the people stumbling through the learning curve are often the ones revealing the most vital improvements.  Who knew beginner bugs could be so powerful?
