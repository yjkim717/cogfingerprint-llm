## The Future of Free: Will AI Eat the Web?

Okay, so I've been wrestling with something lately – the potential reshaping of the internet as we know it. Specifically, I’ve been thinking a lot about Perplexity AI and similar tools. They’re undeniably impressive. Ask a question, and *bam*, you get a concise, sourced answer. No endless scrolling through links. 

But here’s the kicker: where does that sourcing come from? Largely, it’s the vast ocean of free web content we’ve come to rely on. Blogs, news sites, articles – the stuff that's often supported by advertising. 

If AI increasingly becomes *the* primary way people access information, what happens to that ad revenue? Will independent media outlets, who depend on it, be able to survive? And, a slightly more philosophical question, does this shift create a new barrier to information, where access to powerful AI tools necessitates a different kind of payment? 

It feels like we’re at a crucial inflection point, and the future of free web content – and the independent voices that create it – hangs in the balance.
