**The Day My Tiny Workstation Broke Down**

It’s funny how much you invest in these little homelab projects, isn’t it? I’ve been building out my Lenovo Tiny workstation for months – a little beast for running experiments and backups. Last week, it just… died. A sudden hardware failure. My heart sank immediately, especially thinking about all the data stored on its RAID array. It’s a harsh reminder that even the most carefully constructed tech setups can be vulnerable. A good lesson in appreciating the digital world, and backing things up!
