It’s funny how technology can turn fleeting moments into lifelong journeys. Back in 2024, I was just scrolling through old clips from *Sixteen* when an algorithm, almost like a thoughtful friend, suggested Natty’s new group, KISS OF LIFE. I’d followed her story for years, and seeing her debut as a main dancer felt full-circle.

That digital nudge didn’t just introduce me to MOMO and the others—it reconnected me with a dream I’d watched from afar. Now, every time I stream their performances, I’m reminded how tech bridges time, turning past hopes into present joy. Funny, isn’t it? Sometimes a click feels like fate.
