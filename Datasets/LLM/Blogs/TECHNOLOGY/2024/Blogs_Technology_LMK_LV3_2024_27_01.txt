As I sat down to game with my D&D group in early 2024, I was thrilled to dive into the new dance bard subclass. What struck me was its uncanny balance of offense and support - making unarmed attacks while buffing the team. It got me thinking: just as this subclass brings harmony to our tabletop adventures, technology can bring balance to our lives. By embracing the right tools, we can enhance our productivity and foster connections, much like the dance bard brings rhythm to the battlefield.
