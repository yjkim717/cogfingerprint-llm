Finding a refurbished laptop in 2024 feels a lot like my hunt for that used bike in Copenhagen last year. I wanted something affordable and reliable, not some shiny new gadget. I finally found the perfect one at a local tech charity shop—it had a few scratches, but it worked beautifully. It’s a reminder that the best tech doesn’t have to be the latest; sometimes, it’s the one that’s already lived a little.
