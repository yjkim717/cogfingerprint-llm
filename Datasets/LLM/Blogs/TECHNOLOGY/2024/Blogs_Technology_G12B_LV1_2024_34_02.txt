## Remember When We Were Excited About *Everything* Online?

It's funny, isn't it? Back in 2004, a new social media platform felt like a genuine revolution. Now, in 2024, scrolling feels…heavy. I was just thinking about how eagerly we embraced every new app, every quirky online trend. Remember the sheer *joy* of customizing your MySpace profile? 

Now, it's all about algorithms and optimized engagement. There's a quiet sadness in realizing how much of that initial wonder has been replaced by a constant, low-level hum of notifications and comparison. I miss the simpler days of just…connecting. Maybe it’s time to rediscover that feeling, offline.
