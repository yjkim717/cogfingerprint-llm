## That Little Spin & The Algorithm's Gaze

It’s 2024, and we’re all hyper-aware of data. I was reading a Reddit thread the other day about a dog and tug-of-war, and it struck a chord. Someone was worried about their dog spinning mid-play – seemingly joyful, but potentially risky. 

It made me think about our own habits online. We chase those dopamine hits – the likes, the shares, the fleeting validation. Are we, like that dog, getting swept up in a game that *feels* good, but might have unseen consequences? Are we unknowingly spinning ourselves into patterns dictated by algorithms, prioritizing engagement over genuine well-being? Food for thought, right? Maybe a little less spinning, a little more mindful grounding.
