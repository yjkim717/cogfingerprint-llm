>## Does Anyone Remember Geocities? A Digital Nostalgia Trip

It hit me the other day – a sudden, sharp pang of digital nostalgia. I was scrolling through TikTok, as one does, and a filter reminded me of the chaotic, blinking-text, animated-GIF glory of Geocities. Remember those? The early internet homepages, each a personalized explosion of color and questionable design choices?

It's wild to think that in 2024, we have incredibly sophisticated AI and immersive virtual realities, and yet, a part of me misses the raw, unfiltered creativity of those early web spaces. Back then, building a Geocities page *was* the internet. It was about sharing, connecting, and expressing yourself, even if that expression involved Comic Sans and a rotating image of a dancing baby. 

Does anyone else feel this? Or am I just getting old and rambling about dial-up modems? Maybe I’ll try building a retro website just for fun. Anyone want to join me on a trip down memory lane?
