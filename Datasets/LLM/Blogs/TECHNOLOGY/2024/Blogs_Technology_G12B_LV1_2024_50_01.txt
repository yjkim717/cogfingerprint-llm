## The Ghosts in My Headphones

There's a song, "Laura" by Bats for Lashes, that’s been haunting my listening sessions lately. It's not just the melody, but the *space* around Laura's vocals – a gorgeous, swirling reverb that feels like being in a cathedral. It got me thinking about how technology shapes our sonic landscapes. 

Back in 2014, achieving that kind of lushness felt almost magical. Now, plugins can mimic vintage echo chambers with unsettling accuracy. It’s incredible, sure, but sometimes I miss the imperfections, the happy accidents of older gear. Does perfect replication actually *feel* as real as the original ghost in the machine?
