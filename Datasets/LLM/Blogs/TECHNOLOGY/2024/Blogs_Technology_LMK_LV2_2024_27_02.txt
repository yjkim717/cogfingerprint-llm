"As I dove into Balatro in 2024, I was taken aback by the 'checkered deck' feature. It felt like a game-changer - literally. The deck's power made the game feel too easy, even on higher difficulties. I found myself wondering, was the thrill of the game lost due to the deck's consistency? My gaming experience was altered, and I couldn't help but question the delicate balance between challenge and enjoyment in this 2024 hit."
