**Lost in the Algorithm: My Driving School Blues**

Okay, real talk. I’m seriously frustrated with how many things are now – and I mean *really* now – opaque. Remember when a driving school would just hand you a printed schedule? Now, it’s all digital portals and confusing notifications. I’m in driver’s ed, and my school’s “smart” system just isn’t smart about communicating my *stundenplan*. 

Specifically, I’m struggling to track my *theorie-stunden* and *pflichtstunden*. It feels like I'm shouting into a black box! Good *kommunikation* is essential, and this tech feels like it’s actively hindering that.  I just want to know *when* my lessons are, not decipher a series of cryptic alerts.  Is this progress, or just more stress?
