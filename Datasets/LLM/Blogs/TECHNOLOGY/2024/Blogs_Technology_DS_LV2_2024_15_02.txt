It’s 2024, and I’m still chasing that perfect Fallout 4 mod setup. America Rising is incredible, but Boston’s lag was killing the vibe. I spent hours tweaking PRP and stability mods, feeling like a digital archaeologist piecing together a fragile past. It’s funny—in trying to rebuild a virtual America, I ended up wrestling with the very tech meant to make it seamless. A humbling reminder that even in our digital worlds, perfection is a journey, not a destination.
