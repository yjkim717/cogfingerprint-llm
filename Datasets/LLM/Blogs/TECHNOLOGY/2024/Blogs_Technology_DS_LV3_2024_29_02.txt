It’s 2024, and I’ve been watching the C3 language evolve with a mix of excitement and nostalgia. With version 0.5.4, the team is shifting to a monthly release schedule—a sign we’re nearing language completion. It feels like watching a friend grow up: the big features are in place, and now it’s all about refining the details.

What’s beautiful is how much we’re leaning on you—the community. Every new user, with their unique projects and feedback, uncovers bugs or missing pieces we never anticipated. It’s a reminder that software isn’t built in isolation; it’s polished together, one discovery at a time.
