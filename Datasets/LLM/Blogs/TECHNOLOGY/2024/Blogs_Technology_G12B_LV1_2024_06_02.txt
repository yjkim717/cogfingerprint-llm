## The Ghost in My Pocket – and My Dependence on It

It’s funny, isn’t it? How seamlessly technology has woven itself into the fabric of our lives. I was just thinking about it while sweating through this heatwave – trying to navigate summer shorts and, well, other things I need to carry. It made me realize how much I rely on my phone. 

Used to be, if I went out, I grabbed a wallet and keys. Now? It's phone, earbuds, portable charger… a whole ecosystem in my pocket. And if that little rectangle goes down, a surprising amount of my world feels a bit… unstable. It’s a weird dependence, this constant digital tether. Makes you wonder what we'll be like in 2034.
