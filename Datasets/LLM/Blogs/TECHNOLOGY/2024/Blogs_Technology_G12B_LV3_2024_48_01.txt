## Remember Dial-Up? A Technological Heartbreak

Anyone else feel a pang of nostalgia for the *sound* of dial-up internet? It's 2024, and we're streaming in 4K, but I miss that agonizingly slow connection, the anticipation, the feeling of truly *earning* access. It was a frustrating experience, sure, but it feltâ€¦ different. More deliberate. Now, everything is instant, seamless, and sometimes, a little *too* much. Maybe a little digital chaos isn't so bad after all.
