"Upgrading My Home Network for a Seamless WFH Experience"

As I sat in my home office in early 2024, staring at the spinning wheel on my laptop screen, I knew it was time to upgrade my home network. Working from home (WFH) has become the new norm, and a reliable internet connection is crucial. I've been relying on Wi-Fi, but it's just not cutting it. I've been researching ways to improve my setup, and I'm excited to share my plan. I'm going to run a coax line from my router to a splitter, and then use MoCA adapters to create a fast and stable connection. To ensure coverage throughout my home, I'll also install a wireless access point (WAP). I'm looking forward to a lag-free video conferencing experience and seamless streaming. With this upgrade, I'll be able to work from home with confidence, and enjoy a more reliable internet connection overall. It's time to take my home network to the next level.
