"As I stared at my screen, stuck on yet another LeetCode problem, I couldn't help but wonder: is it all worth it? In 2024, coding skills are more valuable than ever, but the hours I've spent wrestling with algorithms have left me drained. Despite the sense of satisfaction with my progress, frustration simmered just below the surface. I'm not alone in this struggle. Many developers are questioning the LeetCode grind. Is it a necessary evil or a productivity killer? I'm still searching for the answer, but one thing's certain - there's more to coding than just solving problems."
