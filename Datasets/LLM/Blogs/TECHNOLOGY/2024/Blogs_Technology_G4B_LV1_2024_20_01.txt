**Scrolling Through Someone Else’s Pain**

Okay, real talk. I’ve been spending *way* too much time lately watching reaction videos and dissecting online drama. It’s bizarre, isn’t it? We’re so connected, yet it feels like we’re all just passively absorbing each other's hurt. Like watching Amerie’s storyline unfold – a constant cycle of setbacks and feeling unfairly treated. 

It’s easy to get caught up in the outrage, to feel like you *understand* someone’s pain through a screen. But I’m starting to realize it’s a pretty isolating experience, too. Maybe I need to log off and actually *feel* something real.
