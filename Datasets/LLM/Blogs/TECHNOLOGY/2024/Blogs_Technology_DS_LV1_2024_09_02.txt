It’s 2024, and I can’t help but reflect on how quickly the esports landscape has shifted. I remember when Fortnite was the promised land for aspiring pros—everyone dreamed of going pro, streaming to thousands, and making a career out of gaming. But then Valorant entered the scene, and suddenly, the path wasn’t so clear.

Watching former Fortnite stars try to transition was eye-opening. Many struggled to adapt, their skills not quite translating, and the competition fiercer than ever. Instead of climbing the ranks in Valorant, most found their footing in streaming or coaching—still in the game, just not on the main stage.

It’s a reminder that in tech and gaming, evolution is constant. What worked yesterday might not tomorrow, and sometimes, success means pivoting, not persisting. Here’s to the grind—and knowing when to change lanes.
