## The Little Guy's Big Problem: A Lenovo Tiny Tale

It's funny how the smallest things can sometimes present the biggest headaches, isn't it? I recently dove into a new project for my homelab – a Lenovo Tiny workstation. These little machines are brilliant for space-saving, but I ran into a snag. Turns out, the RAM modules were... well, let's just say they'd seen better days. Severely damaged.

It got me thinking about the reliability of these compact powerhouses. Are small form factor PCs more prone to hardware failure? It's a question I'm pondering as I source replacements. Anyone else experienced similar issues with their Tiny or other mini-PCs? Let's chat about it – maybe we can learn something together!
