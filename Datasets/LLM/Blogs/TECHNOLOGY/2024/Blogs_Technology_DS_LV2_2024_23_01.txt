It’s 2024, and my phone just reminded me of a photo from three years ago—a blurry, happy moment I’d completely forgotten. In an instant, technology bridged that gap, pulling the past into my present with startling clarity. It got me thinking: our devices are more than tools; they’re personal time machines, preserving our stories in digital amber. Sometimes, the most profound connections aren’t with people, but with the memories we almost let slip away.
