I've been loving my Pixel Watch 2 since 2023, but suddenly it's been draining its battery in hours. I tweaked the AOD settings and enabled Bedtime Mode, but the issue persisted. It's frustrating when tech we rely on fails. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm left questioning the reliability of smartwatches and their ability to keep up with our daily lives in 2024.
