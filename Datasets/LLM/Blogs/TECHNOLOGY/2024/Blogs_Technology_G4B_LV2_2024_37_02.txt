**Lost in the Labyrinth of Mods – and Maybe Myself**

Okay, confession time: I’ve been wrestling with Elden Ring mods lately, and it’s… humbling. Specifically, trying to get the Randomizer and CCW (character customization wizard) working smoothly. It started as a fun little tweak, a way to shake up the game, but now I’m staring at a tangled web of mod conflicts and weapon placement that feels utterly baffling. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? We build these incredible digital worlds, then spend hours trying to bend them to *our* will with little tools.  Sometimes, though, the tools glitch, and you’re left feeling a bit lost, like you’ve wandered into a digital labyrinth – and maybe, just maybe, it's a reflection of trying to control too much in our own lives. Anyone else feel this way lately?
