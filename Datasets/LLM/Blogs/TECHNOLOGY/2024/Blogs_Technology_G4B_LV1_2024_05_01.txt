**Is Digital Really Making Things Easier? My Recent Bus Trip**

Okay, so I was trying to be all eco-conscious and took the bus from NYC to Ithaca last week. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. It was a masterclass in frustrating tech dependence, ironically. I’d meticulously checked schedules on three different bus company apps – each promising real-time updates.
