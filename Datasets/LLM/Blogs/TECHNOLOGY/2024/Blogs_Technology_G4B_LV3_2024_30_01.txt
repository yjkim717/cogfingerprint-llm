**The Weight of a Line of Code – And a Dream of New Horizons**

It’s 2024, and the tech world feels… intense. I’m knee-deep in a STEM OPT program, loving the work, the challenges, and the constant learning. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with something bigger than just debugging – a quiet anxiety about the future. 

Specifically, about *this* future. My OPT is nearing its end, and the thought of the H1B lottery feels less like a hopeful possibility and more like a frantic sprint. It’s a stressful reality for so many of us, right? 

I’ve been researching alternative routes, and honestly, Canada keeps popping up. The promise of a different path, a chance to build a life beyond the usual cycle, is incredibly appealing. It feels like a shift – a deliberate step towards something more sustainable. 

It’s a reminder that our skills, our code, our ambition, can open doors to more than just one company, one visa, one country.  It’s a feeling of wanting to build a future, not just a career.  Anyone else feeling this pull towards new horizons?
