"Life after STEM OPT: Navigating the H1B Lottery and Beyond"

As I sit here in 2024, surrounded by the hum of technology that's changed my life in ways I never thought possible, I'm reminded of the journey that brought me here.

As someone who's navigated this complex immigration landscape, I'm often asked: what's next? How do we ensure a seamless transition? In this blog, I'll share my experiences, insights, and advice on making the most of this challenging yet hopeful time.
