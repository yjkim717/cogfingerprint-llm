## The Algorithm Knows, But Does It *Feel*?

There's something strangely comforting in knowing millions of people felt the same loneliness as me during the pandemic. It reminded me of TIX’s 'Fallen Angel' – that raw, almost vulnerable Eurovision performance. It wasn’t perfect, the style was… unique, but the feeling? The feeling of isolation just *hit*. 

It got me thinking about technology in 2024. We’re more connected than ever, yet so many of us report feeling increasingly disconnected. Algorithms curate our feeds, offering tailored content, but can code truly understand the ache of longing? Can a perfectly optimized playlist replicate the catharsis of a powerful, imperfect ballad? Maybe it’s a silly comparison, but I think it highlights something real: we crave authenticity, even when it's messy.
