## The Date's Not Right (and My Batch Scripting Confidence Took a Hit)

Okay, fellow sysadmins and automation enthusiasts, let's be honest: we’ve *all* been there. Staring at a screen, convinced our logic is flawless, only to have the computer gleefully ignore it. That’s been my week.

I’m trying to automate a file download using WinSCP and a batch script – simple enough, right? The goal? Grab a daily log file named with yesterday’s date. Sounds straightforward, but my date manipulation loop seems to be… skipping. Just vanishing into the digital ether. 

It’s frustrating, especially when you’re trying to learn something new. It makes you question everything! Is the syntax off? Am I misunderstanding the date format? It's a constant cycle of tweaking, running, and sighing. 

Anyone else battling similar scripting gremlins lately? Sharing is caring – drop your tips and tricks in the comments! Maybe together we can conquer this date-related dilemma. It’s 2024, and even automation can feel like a challenge sometimes!
