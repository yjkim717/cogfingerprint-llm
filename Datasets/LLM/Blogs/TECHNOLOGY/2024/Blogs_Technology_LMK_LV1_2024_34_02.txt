As I sat with my partner at a quaint dinner spot near North Stone Oak in San Antonio, celebrating our anniversary in 2024, I couldn't help but think about how technology has changed date nights. We've traded romantic getaways for Google Maps navigation and candlelit dinners for Zoom calls. Yet, that night, surrounded by loved ones and good food, I realized some moments are still best kept tech-free, allowing us to truly reconnect.
