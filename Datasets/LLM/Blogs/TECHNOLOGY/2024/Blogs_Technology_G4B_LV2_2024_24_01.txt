**The Flick That Felt Wrong**

Okay, let’s be honest – how many of us have clung to a particular way of doing something for *years*? I’ve been grinding CS2, specifically CS:GO, since it was still relatively niche, and my flicking – that lightning-fast, instinctive movement – was, well, *good*. Really good. I’d spent countless hours outside the game, using aim trainers, trying to build that muscle memory. 

Then, this year, Valve dropped the subtick mechanic. And suddenly, everything felt… off. 

It’s weird, right? Like a fundamental shift in the ground beneath your feet. My flicks, which used to be clean and decisive, started stuttering. They lacked that smooth, fluid feel I’d cultivated. It wasn’t just that I was getting worse; it was that the *system* was changing, and my ingrained habits just couldn’t keep up. 

I realized it wasn’t just about losing skill; it was about adapting to a new reality. It’s a really frustrating feeling when something you’ve invested so much time in suddenly feels alien. It’s made me think a lot about how we build our routines, and how stubborn we can be about sticking to them, even when the world around us is moving on. 

Anyone else feel this shift lately?
