I still remember the taste of that 2011 breakfast in Hong Kong—the savory pork chop, the rich milk coffee from Kowloon Dairy. But the memory was fading, the restaurant’s name just out of reach. In 2024, I turned to my phone, using a pleco app with OCR to scan old, blurry photos of the street signs. Piece by digital piece, the past reassembled on my screen. It’s funny how technology, so forward-looking, can be the very thing that stitches our cherished memories back together, one pixel at a time.
