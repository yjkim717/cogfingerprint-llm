>## The Algorithm and My Avocado Toast

It’s funny, isn't it? In 2024, we're surrounded by incredible tech – AI writing poems, self-driving cars (almost!), yet I still spent twenty minutes this morning arguing with a smart fridge about the ripeness of my avocado. 

It made me think about our relationship with technology. We expect seamless integration, effortless efficiency. But sometimes, the quirks and frustrations remind you it's all just… code. A complex, evolving system, but still just lines of instructions. And occasionally, those instructions get it very, very wrong about avocado ripeness. Maybe that’s okay. A little human imperfection in a digital world.
