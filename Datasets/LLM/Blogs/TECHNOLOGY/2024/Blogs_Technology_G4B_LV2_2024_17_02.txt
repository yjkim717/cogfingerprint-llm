**The Weight of a Blank Server**

There’s something profoundly unsettling about a fresh VPS. It’s like staring into a vast, empty digital space – a blank canvas brimming with potential, but also a little daunting. I’ve been spending the last few weeks wrestling with exactly how to populate it, specifically with WordPress.

I’ve been circling around the question of how to *really* get this right.  I could just slap on a control panel and call it a day, but that felt… limiting. Then there’s the direct install – familiar, but not exactly future-proof.  

Right now, I'm leaning heavily towards Docker and Nginx. It feels like a more controlled, scalable approach, a way to build a solid foundation.  It’s a bit of a rabbit hole, honestly, diving into containerization and configuration. But there’s a satisfying logic to it, a feeling of actively shaping the environment instead of just letting it happen. 

It’s a reminder that the best tech isn’t just about the shiny tools, it’s about the thoughtful decisions you make along the way.  Anyone else building their own digital worlds lately?
