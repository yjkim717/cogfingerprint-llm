Remember that feeling of fumbling for a light switch in a pitch-black room? That’s exactly what hit me last night, playing *Project Zomboid*. My character was holed up in the old Riverside school, the in-game night an absolute, soupy blackness. I’d found a car, but its headlights were like two weak tea-lights against the void. Inside, I was desperately swiping my cursor along walls, praying to find a light switch.

It struck me how this digital struggle mirrors our modern relationship with tech. We’re surrounded by brilliant, complex systems, yet we’re often just fumbling in the dark for the right button—the right setting, the right app, the right cable. We assume mastery, but one power outage or confusing UI reminds us how fragile that control really is. That moment in the virtual school, heart pounding, wasn't just about zombies; it was a tiny, profound lesson in our own dependency. Sometimes, it takes a simulated darkness to make us see the light.
