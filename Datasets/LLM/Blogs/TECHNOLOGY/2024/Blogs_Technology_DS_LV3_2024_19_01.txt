It’s 2024, and I’ve realized my phone knows more about my desires than my partner does.

Scrolling through curated feeds and endless streams of adult content, I’ve built a fortress of detachment. In the glow of the screen, desire feels simple, anonymous, and utterly safe. There’s no risk, no expectation, and most importantly, no terrifying vulnerability.

But this safety is a trap. I’ve outsourced my sexuality to an algorithm, directing it at pixels instead of a person. The real intimacy—the messy, beautiful, and frightening act of being truly seen by another—feels miles away. I’m connected to the world, yet profoundly disconnected from the one person who matters most.

It’s a paradox of our time: technology offers a boundless arena for fantasy while quietly walling us off from genuine human connection. The real work of therapy, I’m learning, isn't about managing desire, but about daring to be vulnerable enough to feel it with someone real.
