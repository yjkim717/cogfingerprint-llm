"As I prepared for my 6am flight from Ithaca airport in 2024, I realized that even with ride-hailing apps, planning ahead is crucial. I booked Collegetown Cabs for an early taxi, ensuring a smooth ride. This experience made me think - with all the tech advancements, why do we still need to plan old-school for early flights? It's a reminder that sometimes, tech is just a tool, and human judgment is still key."
