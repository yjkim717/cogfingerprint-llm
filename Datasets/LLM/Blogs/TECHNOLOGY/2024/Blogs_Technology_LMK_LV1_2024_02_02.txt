As I sat down to automate some email notifications for my team's project in early 2024, I stumbled upon a familiar cmdlet - Send-MailMessage. While it's been a go-to for many PowerShell users, I couldn't shake off the feeling that it's not the most secure option. After all, the warnings about its deprecation and potential security risks had been echoing in my mind. The main concern is that Send-MailMessage doesn't support modern secure connection protocols, making it vulnerable to exploits. As I dug deeper, I realized it's time to explore alternatives that can send emails via SMTP servers with robust security features. I'm now on the hunt for a more secure way to send automated email notifications. I'm considering using .NET classes or third-party libraries that support modern authentication and encryption. It's 2024, and it's time to upgrade our email-sending game in PowerShell!
