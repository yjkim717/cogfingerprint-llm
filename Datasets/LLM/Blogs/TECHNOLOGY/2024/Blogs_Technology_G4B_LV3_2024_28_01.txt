**Summer Solitude & the Scroll**

It’s that weird college summer feeling, right? Roommates gone, campus quiet… and suddenly I’m craving adventures, but also a serious dose of alone time. I’ve been spending a lot of time just… scrolling, honestly. It’s a surprisingly comforting solo activity, a way to feel connected even when I’m physically distant.  Maybe it’s a little FOMO, maybe it’s just needing space – either way, it’s part of the summer vibe.
