Just last week, my Pixel Watch 2 was a champion, easily lasting a full day. I felt so connected. Then, out of nowhere, a sudden battery plunge. I’d enabled bedtime mode, trusting it to conserve power, only to wake up to a nearly dead device. It’s 2024—shouldn't this be seamless? That abrupt drop felt personal, a small but jarring disconnect in my tech-reliant life. It’s a stark reminder that even our smartest gadgets can have surprisingly dumb moments.
