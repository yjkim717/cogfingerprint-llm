It’s 2024, and I’m still amazed by how much of my life is managed by a single device in my pocket. Just this morning, my phone woke me, brewed my coffee, and reminded me to call my mom. It’s incredible, yet sometimes I wonder—am I using technology, or is it using me? I catch myself scrolling mindlessly, missing the quiet moments. It’s a tool of immense power and subtle control, a daily dance between convenience and consciousness that defines our modern existence.
