As I renovated my 2024 smart home, I stumbled upon a hidden issue - a suspicious patch behind the drywall in the basement. It sparked a similar feeling I once had when debugging code - a nagging sense that something was off. Just as a home inspection can reveal underlying foundation cracks, a thorough review of my project's architecture revealed a hidden bug. By patching up both issues, I've learned that sometimes, it's the unseen problems that require the most attention, whether in tech or in the walls of my home.
