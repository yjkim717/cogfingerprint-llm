It’s 2024, and we’re more connected than ever—yet I’ve never felt more isolated. Sometimes, technology feels like a glittering stage where everyone performs, but no one truly connects. That’s why TIX’s “Fallen Angel” hit me so hard. It’s a raw power ballad about loneliness, and in a world buzzing with notifications, his voice cuts through the noise.

I listened to it after a long day of video calls and empty scrolling. There was no algorithm behind that moment—just a shared, human ache. Eurovision gave him the spotlight, but it was the emotion that bridged the distance.

Maybe that’s the real power of tech: not to replace connection, but to help us find it, even in unexpected places. Sometimes, a fallen angel is all it takes to remind you you’re not alone.
