**The Tightrope Walk: Next.js and Database Logic**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2024 feels like a constant sprint in the tech world. I've been diving deep into Next.js lately, building some ambitious fullstack applications, and I’ve stumbled onto a really interesting, slightly unnerving trend: shoving database logic *right* into the server components. 

It’s undeniably powerful, streamlining things and boosting performance. But there’s a nagging feeling, isn’t there? Like you’re tying yourself to a very long rope.  While it’s tempting to keep everything close, tightly coupled logic can seriously impact scalability and, frankly, makes debugging a nightmare. 

I’m still figuring out the best balance – when is it okay to embrace the convenience, and when do I need to step back and architect for long-term health?  It’s a conversation the whole Next.js community needs to keep having.
