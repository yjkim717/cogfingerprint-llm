You know that moment when you’re trying to piece together a project, and you realize you’ve lost track of all your brilliant, fleeting ideas? That was me last week. I desperately needed an iPad screen recorder that could do more than just capture video—I needed one that logged timestamps and duration, turning my creative chaos into a neat, searchable timeline. It’s funny how the right metadata can feel less like data and more like a digital memory, saving our scattered thoughts one timestamp at a time.
