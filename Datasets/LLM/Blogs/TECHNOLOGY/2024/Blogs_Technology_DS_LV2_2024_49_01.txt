Another 8 hours vanished into the LeetCode void. 2024’s job market is brutal, and my screen is a mosaic of unsolved problems. That fleeting high from a green "Accepted" is addictive, but the clock mocks me. Was today a step toward a dream job, or just a masterclass in stubbornness? I’m building a skill, pixel by pixel, yet the frustration is a silent partner in this grind. Tomorrow, I’ll open the IDE again. The balance between progress and burnout is the real algorithm to solve.
