It’s 2024, and I’ve been wrestling with topic modeling in Python again. Gensim and Sklearn are powerful, but I miss the real-time feedback loop I get with Keras during training. Watching loss drop epoch by epoch feels like a conversation with the model—you know when it’s learning or stuck. Here, I’m left guessing about convergence, tweaking parameters blindly. It’s a reminder that progress in tech isn’t just about raw capability; it’s about designing tools that speak our language. Maybe next year, our topic modeling libraries will catch up and make iteration as intuitive as a good chat.
