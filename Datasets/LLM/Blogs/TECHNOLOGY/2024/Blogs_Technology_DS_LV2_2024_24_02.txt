It’s funny—when I first got my hands on this sleek new AI assistant last year, I thought I’d unlocked a new level of productivity. I’d delegate tasks, draft emails, and even brainstorm ideas with it. But lately, I’ve noticed something strange: my own creative thinking feels rusty, almost strained.

Just like a singer relying too much on mixed voice might lose their falsetto, I’ve leaned so heavily on AI that my natural problem-solving muscles have weakened. There’s a tension now when I try to write or think deeply without help. In 2024, maybe balance is the real innovation—using tech to enhance, not replace, the human spark.
