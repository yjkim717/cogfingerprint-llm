## The Ghosts in the Machine (and My Frustrations with Fallout 4)

Okay, so I'm diving back into Fallout 4, fueled by the "America Rising" mod - the idea of a rebuilding America in the wasteland is just *chef's kiss*. But wow, it's a bumpy ride. My PC is choking, particularly around Boston. Suddenly, my futuristic FPS feels like a slideshow.

It's weird, right? We have incredible processing power, stunning graphics... and yet, a decade-old game, with a hefty mod, can still bring a modern rig to its knees. It's a humbling reminder that technology, for all its leaps, still battles with its own ghosts â€“ the legacy code, the demanding simulations, the constant push for *more*.
