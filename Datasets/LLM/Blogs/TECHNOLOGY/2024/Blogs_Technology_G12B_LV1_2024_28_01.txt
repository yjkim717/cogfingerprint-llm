>## The Algorithm and My Summer Solitude

It’s weird, isn’t it? How technology, designed to connect us, can sometimes amplify feelings of isolation. This summer in Berkeley, with a mostly empty campus and roommates off on adventures, I’ve found myself leaning heavily on digital companions – playlists curated by algorithms, podcasts recommending themselves, and endless scrolling. 

It’s comfortable, sure. But there's a subtle disconnect. I’m consuming stories, but not *living* them. Maybe this summer, I need to consciously unplug a little more and rediscover the joy of quiet, unplanned moments – the kind that don't need an app to validate them. Anyone else feeling this tech-induced paradox in 2024?
