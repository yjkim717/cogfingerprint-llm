"As we dive into 2024, building fullstack applications has become a norm. NextJS has emerged as a go-to framework for developers, thanks to its seamless server-side capabilities. By integrating backend logic with frontend, NextJS enables scalable and efficient applications. However, is it wise to handle complex business logic and database operations on the server-side? While it simplifies development, it can also lead to tightly coupled code. Striking a balance is key. By leveraging NextJS's strengths while keeping backend integration in check, developers can create robust, scalable applications that stand the test of time."
