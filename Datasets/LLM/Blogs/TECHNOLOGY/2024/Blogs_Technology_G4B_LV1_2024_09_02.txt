**The Ghosts in the Machine: What Happens When the Game Changes?**

Remember when esports felt… permanent?  When pro players were these untouchable figures, locked into contracts, dominating streams, and seemingly invincible? I do. It feels like a different world now. 

I was scrolling through Twitch the other day and saw Benjyfishy, Poach, and Zexrow – names that used to scream “Valorant champion” – casually chatting with viewers about their new streaming setups. It’s wild, isn't it?  These guys, who were once at the absolute peak of competitive Fortnite, are now building a new career, one click and subscriber at a time. 

It makes you wonder about the pressure, the relentless grind, and the sudden shift when the game – literally and figuratively – changes.  Are we witnessing a new era of esports stars, comfortable pivoting to content creation?  It's a fascinating, slightly melancholic, reflection on how quickly things can shift in the digital age.
