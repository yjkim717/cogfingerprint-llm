## The ITX Dream and the RX 5600 Reality

Anyone else ever get swept up in a build idea, only for it to shift? I recently saw someone selling an RX 5600 for a steal – $95! They were letting go of it after initially planning an ITX build. It’s a good reminder that tech aspirations evolve. My own mini-PC dream might be on hold, but someone's getting a fantastic deal for their gaming rig! It’s all part of the hobby, isn’t it?
