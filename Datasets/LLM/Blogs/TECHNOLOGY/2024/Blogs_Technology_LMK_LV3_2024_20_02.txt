"As we navigate 2024's tech landscape, I've realized our digital gardens need tending, just like the ones in our backyards. Just as a gardener might struggle with raised bed soil that dries out too quickly, we can struggle with digital tools that overwhelm us. By amending our approach to technology - adding 'digital compost' like mindfulness apps or website blockers - we can improve the soil of our digital lives. This helps our mental clarity and productivity grow, just as soil amendments help plants thrive. By tending to our digital garden, we can cultivate a healthier relationship with technology."
