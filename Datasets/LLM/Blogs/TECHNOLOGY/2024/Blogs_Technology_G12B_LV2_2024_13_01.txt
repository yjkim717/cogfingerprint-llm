## The Ghosts in My Phone's Camera

It’s funny the things that trigger a memory. I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day – someone trying to track down a Hong Kong restaurant they vaguely remembered from over a decade ago. It got me thinking about how we rely on technology to hold onto the past.

I was playing around with my phone's OCR feature (Optical Character Recognition) the other day, scanning a faded menu from a trip to Japan. Suddenly, I was *there* again.  Pleco, my trusty Chinese dictionary app, popped up to help translate a character. It's wild how these tools, designed for utility, can unlock such vivid recollections.  It's like my phone's camera isn’t just capturing images, but preserving echoes of experiences.  Do you ever feel that way?
