It’s 2024, and you’d think clear communication would be the default, right? Especially with all the tech at our fingertips. But here I am, a driving student, stuck in a frustrating loop with my Fahrschule. I just want a simple schedule for my Theorie-Stunden—those 14 Pflichtstunden I need to complete.

You’d assume it’d be easy: a shared digital calendar, a quick app notification, anything. Instead, it’s a guessing game. I show up, hoping I’m not repeating a topic, wasting my time and money. It’s ironic—we have AI that can predict traffic patterns, yet my driving school can’t manage basic digital communication.

This isn’t just about driving lessons; it’s a reminder that technology is only as good as the people using it. Without clear, human-centered communication, even the smartest tools fall short.
