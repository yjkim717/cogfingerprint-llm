**Scrolling Through Copenhagen Dreams**

It’s funny, isn’t it? I was just researching cycling in Copenhagen – seriously considering a trip – and stumbled across a whole conversation about finding affordable bikes. So many people were talking about used bikes and charity shops, the idea of a *refurbished bike* feeling like a really smart, sustainable choice. 

It made me think about how we consume everything now. We’re constantly upgrading our tech, chasing the newest gadget. But maybe there’s something beautiful in slowing down, in finding a perfectly good machine – like a classic bike – and giving it a new life.  It’s a quiet rebellion, really.
