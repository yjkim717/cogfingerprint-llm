It’s 2024, and you’d think every niche in tech would have its cozy corner online. But when I went looking for a Discord server just for C programming, I was surprised—everything was lumped together as C/C++, with little focus on the foundational language I love. So, I decided to build my own space: a dedicated C programming server. It’s been amazing to watch it grow into a hub where learners and experts share code snippets, debug tricky pointers, and celebrate the elegance of C. Sometimes, carving out your own community is the best way forward.
