## Beyond the Built-In: Hunting for the Perfect iPad Screen Recorder

Okay, tech friends, let's be honest: the native iPad screen recording is…fine. But as a content creator in 2024, "fine" doesn't cut it. I'm on the hunt for an app that goes further, something that captures not just the visuals, but *details* – accurate timestamps, video duration, maybe even some clever tagging. Anyone else craving a little more metadata magic from their iPad recordings? Recommendations welcome!
