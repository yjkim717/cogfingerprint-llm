"Revisiting Hong Kong's Breakfast Scene through the Lens of Technology. In 2024, I'm on a mission to rediscover a 2011 breakfast gem in Hong Kong. Armed with Pleco's OCR capabilities, I scour the streets of Kowloon, searching for that perfect morning meal. I stumble upon a quaint eatery near Kowloon Dairy, and as I scan the menu, Pleco's tech helps me decipher the traditional Chinese characters. Nostalgia washes over me as I relive fond memories. The fusion of old and new is a true marvel - technology bridging the gap between past and present, one breakfast spot at a time."
