Input: Nostalgia for the Wild Mage class from Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition, particularly missing the Reckless Dweomer spell and its lack of detrimental consequences.
Output: Remember those early online RPGs? I’ve been thinking about the sheer *freedom* of systems like D&D 2e.  It wasn’t about optimization; it was about chaotic, joyful magic. Like the Wild Mage’s Reckless Dweomer – a spell that just *exploded* with potential, without the fear of crippling consequences. It’s a reminder that sometimes, a little delightful risk is worth more than perfect efficiency.
