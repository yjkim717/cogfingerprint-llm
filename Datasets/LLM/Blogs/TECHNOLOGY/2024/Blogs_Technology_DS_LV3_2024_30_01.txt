The glow of my laptop screen feels different these days. It’s 2024, and my 24-month STEM OPT grace period is dwindling faster than my phone battery. I’m living in the strange limbo between being a student and… whatever comes next.

My days are a delicate balancing act. I’m fully invested in my tech role, pouring everything into projects I believe in, all while a corner of my mind is perpetually calculating immigration probabilities. The upcoming H1B lottery feels like a high-stakes tech launch where I’m not the engineer but the product. My university just confirmed my SEVIS transfer, making this new employment status feel official, yet somehow temporary.

It’s a peculiar kind of pressure, trying to build a career on a foundation of hope and spreadsheets. But in this waiting game, I’m learning that resilience isn't just a buzzword for agile development; it's the quiet code we write for our own futures, debugging one uncertain day at a time.
