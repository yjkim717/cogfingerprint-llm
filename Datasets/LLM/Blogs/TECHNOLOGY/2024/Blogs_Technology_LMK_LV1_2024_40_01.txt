As I searched for the perfect microcontroller board in 2024, I realized my needs had evolved. I wanted a board that could handle multiple projects, with ample GPIO headers for flexibility. The RPi Pico caught my eye, but I was hesitant due to its limited debug port. I needed a reliable way to troubleshoot my code. After some research, I discovered the HAL libraries, which offered a robust and well-maintained framework for development. In the end, I found a board that checked all my boxes, and I'm excited to see where it takes my future projects.
