**My Plex Pi Panic – And How I Finally Won**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2024 feels like a constant battle against buffering. I’d finally built a little Plex server on my Raspberry Pi 4B, dreaming of effortless streaming. Instead, I got…intermittent slowdowns. It was maddening! After days of staring at log files (seriously, who *writes* these things?), I realized caching was the culprit. A simple restart of the Plex service, combined with clearing the cache, did the trick. It just goes to show, sometimes the simplest solutions are hidden in the tech we build.  Lesson learned: even a tiny server needs a little TLC.
