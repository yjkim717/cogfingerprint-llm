## The Bluetooth Dream That Faded

It’s a strange feeling, seeing a promising feature just… vanish. I stumbled across a Bugzilla ticket recently detailing Firefox’s WebBluetooth implementation being marked "Wontfix." Remember the excitement around controlling Bluetooth devices directly from the web? So much potential for custom hardware integration! 

Now, it seems that ship has sailed. It's a small thing, sure, but it leaves you wondering – what innovative pathways get abandoned along the way? Tech moves fast, but sometimes, I miss the feeling of genuine, exploratory possibility.
