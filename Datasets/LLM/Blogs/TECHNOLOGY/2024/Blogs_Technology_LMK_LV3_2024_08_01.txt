In today's world, where social media dominates our lives, it's ironic that I feel more isolated than ever. I'm not alone in being treated like an accessory by friends who invite me to events, but then barely make an effort to engage in meaningful conversations. It's as if being present is enough, but I crave connection. I've started to realize that technology-free interactions are essential to building genuine friendships. When we're glued to our screens, we miss out on the subtle cues and nuances that make human connections so rich. For someone like me, who struggles with social anxiety, it's even more crucial to have real, face-to-face interactions. By putting away our devices, we can foster deeper relationships and break free from the feeling of being just another accessory in our friends' lives. It's time to reevaluate our priorities and rediscover the joy of truly being together.
