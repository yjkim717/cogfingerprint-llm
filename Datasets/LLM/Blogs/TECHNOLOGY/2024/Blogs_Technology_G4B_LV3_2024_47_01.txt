**The Ghost in the Machine**

There’s something deeply unsettling about a computer that just… *doesn't* cooperate.

It made me think about the hidden desire for a truly robust, expandable system.  We crave stability, a workstation that can grow with our needs, not one that feels like a temperamental ghost in the machine.  What’s *your* tech frustration lately?
