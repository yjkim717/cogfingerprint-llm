"My trusty Lenovo Tiny workstation, the heartbeat of my 2024 homelab, suddenly flatlined. The culprit? Burnt RAM modules. I'm still reeling from the shock. As I reflect on this failure, I'm reminded of the fragility of our tech. Have you had a similar experience with your mini workstation? I'm on a mission to rebuild and reinforce my setup, potentially with RAID 1 SSDs for added security. I'd love to hear your homelab horror stories and learn from your experiences. Let's swap tales and emerge stronger, together."
