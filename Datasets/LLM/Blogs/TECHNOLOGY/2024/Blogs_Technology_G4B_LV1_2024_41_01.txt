**Bridging the Past & the Pixel: My Wi-Fi Woes**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with my internet for weeks, and it’s seriously stressing me out. Living in a Victorian house is gorgeous, but let’s be honest – the wiring is… ancient. My speeds were glacial, and I was constantly battling dropped connections. 

I decided to go full-on tech-geek and tackle it myself. I’m planning on using Moca adapters to piggyback off my existing coax cable – a bit of a hack, I know, but it’s cheaper than a full fiber optic install.  I’m also upgrading the coax line itself, hoping that’ll make a difference.  It’s a weird feeling, trying to modernize something so steeped in history!  Wish me luck – and maybe send some Wi-Fi vibes my way! #homeneting #techproblems #victorianhome
