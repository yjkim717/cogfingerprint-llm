As I scrolled through my social media feeds in 2024, I stumbled upon a familiar tune - TIX's 'Fallen Angel,' the Eurovision song that had captured hearts worldwide. To my surprise, I found myself emotionally resonating with the melody, despite not being a die-hard Eurovision fan. This unexpected connection got me thinking about the power of music in the digital age. With music streaming services and social media, artists can now reach a global audience, transcending geographical boundaries. TIX's song was a testament to this phenomenon, showcasing how technology can bridge cultural divides and create a shared emotional experience. As I reflected on this, I realized that our connection to music - and to each other - is being reshaped by technology, allowing us to form meaningful bonds with others across the globe, one song at a time.
