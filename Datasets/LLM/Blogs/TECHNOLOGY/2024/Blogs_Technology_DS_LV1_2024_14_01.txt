It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking about how much tech feels like that rushed Ark animated series I watched last week. You know, the one where the characters had zero chemistry and the story felt cobbled together? Sometimes, innovation feels the same way—we push so hard for the next big thing that we forget what made tech compelling in the first place: solving real problems for real people.

Lately, I’ve seen apps and gadgets launch with flashy features but clunky user experiences, almost like they were rewritten at the last minute to chase trends. It’s a reminder that in our rush to be inclusive and cutting-edge, we can’t skip the basics. Tech should connect us, not just check boxes. Maybe it’s time to slow down and build with purpose again.
