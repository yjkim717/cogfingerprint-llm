**Hunting for My Digital Command Center**

It’s 2024, and I’m officially drowning in websites. I’ve been tinkering with Debian and Ubuntu for years, mostly loving the flexibility, but managing everything through the terminal is…well, it’s a lot. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over finding a good control panel – something free and with a nice GUI – to wrangle these virtual hosts.  

I’ve spent hours researching options like LNMP stacks, but nothing quite clicks.  It feels like I'm always fighting the tools instead of streamlining them.  Anyone else battling this digital chaos?  What’s your go-to solution for keeping things organized?
