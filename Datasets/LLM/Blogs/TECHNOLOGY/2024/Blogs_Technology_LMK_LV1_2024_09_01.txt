"Discovering Kiss of Life was a game-changer for me in 2024. As a long-time fan of K-pop, I was blown away by their energetic debut. But what really drew me in was Natty, a talented member I'd admired since her days on Sixteen. Watching her journey from a competitive show to becoming part of a thriving group was inspiring. Now, I'm hooked on Kiss of Life's music and can't wait to see what the future holds for this talented sixteen-year-old group - a true testament to the power of digital discovery in today's connected world."
