It’s 2024, and I’m still amazed by how much a custom Shopify theme can transform your online presence. We started with modified Dawn and Impulse themes for our international stores, but something was missing—that seamless feel that turns visitors into loyal customers. Then we discovered Impact. It wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about crafting an experience tailored to each market. Our conversion rates began to climb, proving that the right theme isn’t just a design choice—it’s the heartbeat of your brand’s global story.
