Here is a reflective blog post on technology:

"As I tend to my raised bed garden in 2024, I'm reminded of the tech advancements that have transformed gardening. Just like how I'd amend dry soil with a mix that retains moisture, I've learned to 'amend' my approach to technology. I used to be overwhelmed by the latest gadgets, but now I take a more measured approach. I prioritize what's truly useful, like apps that help me monitor soil moisture. By being more intentional with tech, I've freed up space to focus on what really matters - like nurturing my vegetable starters. It's a balance I've finally got right."
