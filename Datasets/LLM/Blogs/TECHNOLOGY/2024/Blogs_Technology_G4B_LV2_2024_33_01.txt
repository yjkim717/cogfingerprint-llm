**The Ghost in the Cloud**

It’s funny how tech can feel both incredibly powerful and frustratingly…sneaky. Just last week, I ran into a weird glitch with my cloud setup. Terminated an instance, thought I’d cleaned up everything, and then BAM – unexpected storage charges. Turns out, a lingering boot volume was still hanging around! 

It really brought home how easily things can accumulate in the digital world. It’s a gentle reminder to be deliberate, to actually *delete* what we don’t need, not just stop using it.  Anyone else have a “ghost file” story to share? #cloudcomputing #techproblems
