Okay, here’s a reflective blog post inspired by the TIX ‘Fallen Angel’ summary, set in 2024 and aiming for a conversational, storytelling tone:

**Lost in the Scroll, Found in the Song**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a song – especially a really *good* one – can cut through all the digital noise? I’ve been obsessing over TIX’s ‘Fallen Angel’ lately. It’s got that classic power ballad thing going on, all soaring vocals and dramatic synths, but it feels… raw. Like it’s built on genuine feeling. 

I’ve been spending so much time lost in the endless scroll of TikTok and newsfeeds this year, feeling this weird sense of isolation.  ‘Fallen Angel’ just hits differently. It reminds me that even with all this connection, sometimes you need to really *feel* something, and let it wash over you.  Maybe that’s what music is for, right?  A little bit of grounding in the chaos.
