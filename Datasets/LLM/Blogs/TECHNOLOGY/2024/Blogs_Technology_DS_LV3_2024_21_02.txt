Remember that sinking feeling when your hosting bill arrived? For years, Plesk was my go-to, but the cost was stifling my side projects. This year, I finally made the leap to a free control panel on my Ubuntu server. Setting up that first LNMP stack and effortlessly adding virtual hosts felt like unlocking a new level of creative freedom. Suddenly, spinning up a new domain with its own PHP version wasn't a budget debate, just a few simple clicks. Itâ€™s liberating to be back in full control.
