**The Tiny Bit That Feels Huge**

Remember those early days of [Game Name]? When you could just *carry everything*? I’m talking overflowing inventories, mountains of gold, and a feeling of boundless potential. Lately, though, I’ve noticed something… frustrating. This latest patch seems to have quietly shrunk our carry capacity. 

It’s a small change, sure, but it’s throwing off the whole resource management system. Suddenly, those carefully planned expeditions feel less rewarding, those hard-earned gold bonuses feel… diminished. It’s a weird reminder that even in a digital world, these little tweaks can really impact the feeling of progression. 

It makes you think, doesn’t it? How much do we rely on the *illusion* of limitless possibility?  Maybe it's time to appreciate the value of a lighter load.
