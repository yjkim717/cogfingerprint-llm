**Lost in the Room Numbers – and Why It Matters**

Remember staring at a chaotic WebSocket connection list, desperately trying to figure out which “room” was which? I do. It’s a surprisingly common frustration when building real-time applications with Socket.IO. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with how to make managing these spaces – public and private – feel less… overwhelming.

The goal? To ditch the endless state management and just *show* users the room types they’re interested in.  Think clearly defined “living room,” “conference room,” “private study” – instantly recognizable.  It’s a small tweak, but it’s a huge step towards a smoother, more intuitive experience.  Anyone else feel like they’ve battled this digital clutter?
