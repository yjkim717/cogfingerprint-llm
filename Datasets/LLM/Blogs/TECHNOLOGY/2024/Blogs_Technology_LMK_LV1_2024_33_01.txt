"As I dug into my Oracle Free Tier account in 2024, I was surprised to see storage space dwindling. The culprit? A terminated instance that still had a boot volume lingering. I was relieved to discover that deleting the unused volume was a simple fix. With a few clicks, I reclaimed the space and avoided unnecessary charges. A valuable lesson learned: regular clean-ups are a must, even in the cloud. If you're an Oracle Free Tier user, take a minute to review your resources â€“ you might be surprised at what's still running in the background!"
