## The Great Flatmate Thermostat Wars (and a glimmer of smart home hope)

Okay, let’s be honest. Living with flatmates is a beautiful, chaotic experiment in compromise. You learn to share, to negotiate, to appreciate the quiet joy of having someone else do the dishes (sometimes). But there’s one battle that seems to rear its head in *every* shared house I've ever known: the thermostat.

Right now, my house is in the thick of it. We’ve got the classic scenario: a central thermostat, a house that’s about as well-insulated as a cardboard box, and three wildly different temperature preferences. One person is perpetually cold, another melting, and I’m just trying to survive. The arguments? Frequent. The passive-aggressive blanket-hogging? Legendary.

It got me thinking though, isn’t it ironic that in 2024, we’re still wrestling with this prehistoric system? We have self-driving cars, AI that writes poetry, and yet, coordinating a comfortable room temperature feels like a medieval negotiation.

I’ve been researching a potential solution: individual radiator controls. The idea is simple – each room gets its own thermostat, allowing us to dial in our perfect comfort level. It feels almost futuristic, right?  Not only could it (hopefully) end the constant bickering, but it could also be more energy-efficient. We’re essentially only heating the rooms that are occupied, which feels like a win-win for both our sanity and our wallets.

I'm pitching the idea to my flatmates this weekend. Wish me luck! I’m hoping we can move beyond the thermostat wars and embrace a slightly smarter, and significantly more peaceful, way of sharing a home. Maybe a little smart home tech is exactly what we need to bridge the gap between differing comfort levels.



What about you? Any shared living heating horror stories?
