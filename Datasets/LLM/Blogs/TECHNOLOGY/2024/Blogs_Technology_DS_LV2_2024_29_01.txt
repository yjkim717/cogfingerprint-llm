It’s 2024, and sometimes it feels like every programming conversation orbits around AI or the latest web framework. But I kept thinking about C—the quiet, foundational language that powers so much of our digital world. I was surprised to find no real online hubs just for it. So, I started a Discord server dedicated solely to C programming. It’s been humbling to watch it grow into a space where newcomers and veterans alike share code, debug tricky pointers, and remind each other why this "old-school" language still matters. Sometimes, the best communities are the ones you build yourself.
