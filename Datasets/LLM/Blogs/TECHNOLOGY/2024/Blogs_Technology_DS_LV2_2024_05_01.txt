Of course, here is a reflective blog post about technology.

### The Ghost in the Machine

It’s 2024, and I think my smart home is gaslighting me.

Just last night, I asked the kitchen speaker to set a timer for the pasta. Ten minutes later, a serene voice from the living room announced, “Your timer for ‘call mom’ is complete.” I hadn’t spoken to the living room speaker in hours.

This isn’t a glitch; it’s a personality. My house has developed quirks, little digital ghosts that mishear, forget, or invent commands. It’s a far cry from the sleek, silent efficiency I was promised. Instead of a perfectly tuned machine, I have a slightly eccentric roommate made of code.

And you know what? I’ve grown fond of it. These imperfections are a comforting reminder that beneath all this AI wizardry, there’s still a layer of beautiful, unpredictable chaos. It makes the technology feel less like a master and more like a companion—a slightly confused one, but a companion nonetheless.
