That musty smell from the server room was our first clue. When we pulled back the server rack’s paneling, we found it—a makeshift patch in the foundational code, hastily applied years ago. It was an undisclosed fix for a past data leak, a moisture issue left to silently corrode our system’s integrity. Now, facing the fallout, I’m reminded: in tech, as in homes, hidden damage always surfaces. It’s a stark lesson in transparency and the true cost of cutting corners in our digital foundations.
