"As I reflect on the rapid advancements in AI, I'm reminded of the importance of accessibility. That's why I'm thrilled to share that we're open-sourcing our managed API gateway and client libraries for AI services, built with Kotlin. By making these tools available, we hope to empower developers to focus on what matters most - building innovative applications. We're inviting the community to contribute, provide feedback, and help shape the future of AI. Let's work together to make AI more inclusive and user-friendly. Your input is invaluable in making this vision a reality in 2024 and beyond."
