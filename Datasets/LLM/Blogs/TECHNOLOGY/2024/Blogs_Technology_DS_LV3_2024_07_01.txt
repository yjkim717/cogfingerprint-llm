It’s 2024, and as a sustainable clothing founder, I’ve realized our reliance on Facebook ads was a short-term fix. Our loyal community thrives on heartfelt email campaigns, but I craved more organic discovery. So, we shifted focus—telling our story through transparent content and nurturing genuine connections. Now, seeing our brand name pop up in search bars, unprompted, feels like quiet victory. It’s not just marketing; it’s building trust, one thoughtful click at a time.
