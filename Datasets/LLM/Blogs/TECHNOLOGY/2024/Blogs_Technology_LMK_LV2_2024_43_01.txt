As I dive into the world of NextJS in 2024, I'm torn between leveraging its server-side features to handle complex business logic and the potential trade-offs on scalability and maintainability. Can we truly build robust full-stack applications with NextJS, or are we sacrificing long-term viability for short-term gains? As I weigh the benefits of streamlined database logic and backend API integration, I'm reminded that the future of web development lies in striking a balance between innovation and prudence. Is NextJS the right tool for the job, or just a fleeting trend?
