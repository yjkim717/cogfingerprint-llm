## The Algorithm and the Unexpected Sunset

Remember when "digital detox" felt like a radical idea? Now, it's just Tuesday. I spent last weekend hiking, intentionally leaving my phone tucked away. Ironically, the most beautiful sunset I've seen all year was captured not by a lens, but by memory. It’s a gentle reminder: sometimes, the best experiences aren’t the ones we share online, but the ones we simply *feel*. And maybe, just maybe, that’s a feature, not a bug.
