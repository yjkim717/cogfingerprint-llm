The other day, I used a translation app’s OCR to scan a faded photo of a restaurant meal from 2011—pork chops from a place near Kowloon Dairy. It felt like digital archaeology, resurrecting a memory with a phone scan.

It got me thinking: in 2024, we carry pocket portals to the past. Yet, no algorithm can tell me if that specific warmth still exists or if it’s just another replaced storefront. Technology connects us to history, but it can’t preserve the soul of a place.
