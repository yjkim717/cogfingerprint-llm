**Lost in the Topic Modeling Maze**

There’s something wonderfully frustrating about diving into Python libraries like Gensim and Scikit-learn. I recently hit a wall trying to get a handle on topic modeling – specifically, tracking those crucial convergence metrics. It felt like chasing ghosts! I longed for a simpler, more visual approach, like Keras’s elegant callbacks.  It’s a common struggle, really.  Maybe the next generation of these tools will prioritize ease of use, making advanced techniques less daunting for the rest of us.
