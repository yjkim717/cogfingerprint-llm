Navigating the complexities of immigration status can be a daunting task, especially when it intersects with employment. As I sit here in 2024, reflecting on my STEM OPT's impending expiration, I'm faced with a pressing question: can I remain employed by my company without receiving a salary or working hours? The H1B lottery looms ahead, and the uncertainty is palpable. I've invested so much in my career, and the thought of disrupting my professional momentum is unsettling. Maintaining a formal employment status seems crucial, yet the financial implications of doing so without pay are unclear. As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that the tech industry is built on innovation and adaptability. Perhaps, I can leverage this uncertainty as an opportunity to explore new avenues, whether within my current company or beyond. The journey ahead will require patience, resilience, and a willingness to navigate uncharted territory.
