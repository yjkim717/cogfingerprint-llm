It’s 2024, and I’m watching the Ark animated series with a heavy heart. I had high hopes—so many of us did. But as the episodes fly by, it’s clear the soul of the original story got lost in the rush.

Characters feel rewritten, their depth sacrificed for a surface-level inclusive focus that, while well-intentioned, rings hollow without strong storytelling. The plot races forward, skipping the emotional beats that made the source material compelling.

It’s a reminder that in tech and entertainment, innovation shouldn’t come at the cost of quality. We deserve stories that respect both representation and narrative craft—not just one at the expense of the other.
