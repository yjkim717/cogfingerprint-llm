**Pixel Dreams & Human Faces**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Scrolling through feeds full of hyper-stylized robots and digital gods, I find myself yearning for something…familiar. Like in *Mega Man X*, or even the gritty world of *Zero Iris*, I crave a touch of humanity in the design. I’m picturing a stoic Yakuza enforcer with a hint of sadness, or a Sigma with eyes that actually *look* thoughtful.  Maybe that’s just me, projecting a little bit of ourselves onto the code.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps explore a different angle?
