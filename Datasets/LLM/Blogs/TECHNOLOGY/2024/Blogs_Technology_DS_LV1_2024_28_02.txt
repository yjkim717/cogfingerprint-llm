Sitting here in 2024, staring at my course planner feels like trying to debug a complex algorithm with no documentation. I’m deep into my CS major, and I’ve just added a stats double major—Data 8 and Math 53 are staring back at me from the screen, demanding their share of my time and brainpower.

It’s a delicate dance between logic and probability, code and calculus. Sometimes I wonder if I’m overloading my circuits, but then I remember: in a world driven by AI and big data, this fusion of skills isn’t just useful—it’s essential. Balancing this schedule is my own real-world optimization problem, and I’m determined to find the solution.
