### The Ghost in the Machine: A Layer 2 Mystery

It was one of those head-scratchers that makes you question your entire career. There I was in 2024, staring at Router P, which was stubbornly refusing to become OSPF neighbors with anyone. My configurations were pristine—I’d checked them a dozen times. The interfaces were up, and my packet sniffer confirmed it: broadcast traffic was flowing freely across our Layer 2 WAN. So why the silent treatment?

The answer, when I found it, was a classic case of seeing the trees but missing the forest. I was so focused on the logical layer—the OSPF hellos and network statements—that I’d ignored the physical reality. The Layer 2 WAN cloud, while passing broadcasts, wasn't configured to forward the specific multicast addresses OSPF uses to discover neighbors. My routers were essentially shouting into a soundproof room.

It was a humbling reminder that in our software-defined world, the foundation still matters. Dynamic routing is brilliant, but it rests on the assumption that the underlying path is truly clear. Sometimes, the most advanced problems have the simplest, most foundational solutions.
