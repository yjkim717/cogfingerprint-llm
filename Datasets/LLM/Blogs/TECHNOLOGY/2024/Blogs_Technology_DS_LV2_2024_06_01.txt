### The Ghost in My Pocket

It hit me yesterday, standing in line for coffee. My phone was dead, and for the first ten minutes, I just… existed. I watched people. I listened to the hiss of the espresso machine. I felt genuinely bored, and it was wonderful.

It’s 2024, and my smartphone is less a tool and more a phantom limb—an extension of my consciousness I don’t even think about until it’s gone. We’ve outsourced so much to these sleek rectangles: our memories, our sense of direction, our patience. That little device holds my entire social world, my work, my distractions, my peace, and my anxiety, all competing for attention in a palm-sized arena.

I’m not advocating for throwing it all away. The magic of a video call with my parents, who live a thousand miles away, is real. But that moment of forced disconnection was a stark reminder. The most profound technology isn't the one that fills every silence, but the one that gives us the space to remember who we are without it. I left the café not just with a latte, but with a quiet resolution to let my mind wander a little more often.
