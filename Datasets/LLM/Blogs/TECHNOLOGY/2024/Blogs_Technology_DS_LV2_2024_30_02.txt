It hit me last night, scrolling through a video call grid of my team—faces in five different time zones. My project manager was brewing coffee in London while I was winding down with tea in California. In 2024, "the office" is a concept, not a place.

This digital-first world is incredible, a marvel of connectivity I dreamed of as a kid. But it’s also quietly exhausting. The constant context-switching, the blurring of work and home, the pressure to be "on" because the tools are always there.

Technology gave us the freedom to work from anywhere, but it forgot to build an "off" switch. I’m learning that the most crucial skill now isn't mastering the latest software, but mastering our own boundaries within it. The real innovation is knowing when to log off.
