**My Digital Dirt – And Why I Need a Reboot**

Seriously, my phone feels like it’s drying out faster than my raised bed soil this summer. I’m constantly doom-scrolling, refreshing feeds, and generally letting notifications dictate my mood. It’s exhausting! I realized I needed to *amend* my digital habits – add some intentionality. 

Like, I’ve been relying on plant starters (quick fixes!), but I need a richer, deeper approach. I’m thinking a digital detox this weekend – turning off notifications, maybe even reading a real book. It’s time to get back to basics, just like amending that soil to give my plants a fighting chance.  Anyone else feeling the digital drought?
