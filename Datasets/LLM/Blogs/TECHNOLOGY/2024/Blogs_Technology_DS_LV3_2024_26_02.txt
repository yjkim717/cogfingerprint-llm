It’s funny how a simple case upgrade can completely change your perspective. Last year, I snagged a gently used RX 5600 for my ITX build, but it came with this massive triple-fan cooler—comically oversized for that tiny chassis. I found it on a hardware swap forum, and it felt like a quirky, personal secret. Now, with a proper case, that overbuilt cooler is no longer a tight squeeze but a quiet, efficient powerhouse. It’s a small reminder that in tech, as in life, sometimes the perfect fit isn’t about the size of the part, but the space you give it to breathe.
