It’s 2024, and I’m starting to think my phone knows me better than I know myself. The other day, I was just *thinking* about needing new running shoes, and suddenly, my feed was a marathon of ads for them. It’s equal parts impressive and unsettling.

This constant digital companionship makes me wonder: are we curating our lives, or is the algorithm doing it for us? We scroll through a world tailored to our secret desires and unspoken anxieties, a personalized reality that feels both comforting and confining. It’s a connection that’s always on, but is it ever truly honest? Sometimes, I just want to look up and remember what the unfiltered world feels like.
