## The AI Coding Buddy That Just Wasn't My Cup of Tea (Yet)

Okay, let's be real. We've all been hyped about AI coding assistants. The promise? Effortlessly whip up components, debug like a pro, and maybe even finally understand those tricky Vue 3 intricacies. I dove in headfirst a few weeks ago, genuinely excited to see if an LLM (Large Language Model) could be the coding companion I’d been dreaming of. My weapon of choice? A popular option, primed and ready to tackle my Vue 3 projects.

The initial sparkle was definitely there. The suggestions popped up fast, the syntax looked right, and for a few fleeting moments, I felt like a coding wizard. But then… the cracks started to show.

It wasn't a catastrophic failure, mind you. It was more like a persistent, low-level hum of inaccuracy. A misplaced prop, a function that didn't quite do what it promised, a dependency that was completely off. I’d spend more time *correcting* the AI’s output than I would have just writing it myself. 

And that's when the frustration really set in. I'm a firm believer in learning by doing. I want to *understand* the 'why' behind the code, not just copy and paste functional (but potentially flawed) solutions. Having an AI spit out code, only to have to dissect and fix it, felt like a detour from that learning process. It felt like I was relying on a crutch that was actually hindering my progress.

I experimented with different prompts, tried to be incredibly specific, even fed it existing code snippets as context. Sometimes it worked brilliantly, other times it was...well, let's just say I ended up with some truly bizarre Vue 3 constructs.

Look, I'm not writing this to bash LLMs. I genuinely believe they have enormous potential. But for *me*, at *this* point in my journey, they felt more like a distraction than a helpful tool. Maybe future iterations, trained on even larger datasets and with more nuanced understanding of code context, will change my mind. For now, I'm sticking with good old-fashioned Googling and a healthy dose of trial and error.
