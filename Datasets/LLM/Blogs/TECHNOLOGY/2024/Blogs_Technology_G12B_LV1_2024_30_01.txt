## The Waiting Game & the Algorithm's Whim

It’s a weird feeling, isn't it? Being on the periphery of your own career. My STEM OPT ended last month, and while the experience was incredible, I’m now in this…limbo. Waiting. Waiting for the H1B lottery, specifically. 

It's wild to think that my future here, my ability to continue contributing to this amazing AI project I’m working on, hinges on a random digital draw. I’m technically still “with the company,” allowed to be around, absorbing knowledge, but without the usual paycheck or assigned tasks. A strange kind of professional ghosting.

It really highlights how much our lives, especially in tech, are dictated by algorithms and bureaucratic processes. You build skills, you contribute, you *earn* a place… and then you’re at the mercy of a system that feels, frankly, a little arbitrary.  Hoping the numbers align, hoping the system sees value in letting me stay.  It’s a lesson in patience, and a reminder to maybe start seriously looking at those Canadian immigration options everyone keeps talking about.
