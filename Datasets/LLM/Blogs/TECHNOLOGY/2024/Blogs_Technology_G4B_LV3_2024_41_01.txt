**The Ghosts in the Walls – And How I Finally Got My Office Online**

There’s something wonderfully strange about older homes, isn’t there? My new office, tucked away upstairs in my Victorian, feels like it’s holding onto a thousand stories. And lately, it was holding onto my internet connection – or rather, *not* holding onto it properly. I had blazing fiber internet downstairs, but the upstairs was stubbornly slow. 

Turns out, the house was built with coax cables – remnants of an old cable TV system – and an unused fiber line just… sitting there. It felt a bit like discovering a secret room.  I started researching, and the terms “Moca” and “WAP” popped up.  It felt a little nerdy, admitting I needed adapters and a wireless access point to bridge the gap. 

But honestly? It’s been incredibly satisfying.  Bringing that speed upstairs, connecting to that hidden potential, feels like coaxing a little bit of the house’s history into the 21st century. It’s a reminder that even in a world of constant upgrades, sometimes the best solutions are found in the unexpected corners of our homes.  What hidden tech quirks have you uncovered in *your* space?
