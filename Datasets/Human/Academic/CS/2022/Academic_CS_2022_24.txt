Abstract:
ABSTRACT Undergirded by “economic theory of the principal–agent problem”, the study investigated secondary school teachers’ perception of the influence of large-scale testing accountability on teaching and learning. Cross-sectional survey design was used. Simple random sampling was also employed to select 200 teachers for this study. The exploratory factor analysis results showed that although large-scale testing accountability serves as a motivational factor for teachers to be more productive, it puts pressure on teachers and students. Teachers reported teaching to the test (i.e. washback) and spending a lot of instructional time preparing students for the test. Teachers suggested that large-scale testing results should not be seen as the sole basis for teacher effectiveness. Rather, they indicated that large-scale testing results should be used to foster equitable distribution of educational resources and support teachers’ professional development to enhance teaching and learning. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.
