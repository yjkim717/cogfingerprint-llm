Abstract:
The distortion of six different intrinsic metrics and quasi-metrics under conformal and quasiregular mappings is studied in a few simple domains $G\subsetneq\mathbb{R}^n$. The already known inequalities between the hyperbolic metric and these intrinsic metrics for points $x,y$ in the unit ball $\mathbb{B}^n$ are improved by limiting the absolute values of the points $x,y$ and the new results are then used to study the conformal distortion of the intrinsic metrics. For the triangular ratio metric between two points $x,y\in\mathbb{B}^n$, the conformal distortion is bounded in terms of the hyperbolic midpoint and the hyperbolic distance of $x,y$. Furthermore, quasiregular and quasiconformal mappings are studied, and new sharp versions of the Schwarz lemma are introduced.
