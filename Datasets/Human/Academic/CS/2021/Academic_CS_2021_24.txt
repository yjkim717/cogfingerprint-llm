Abstract:
ABSTRACT The study investigated the social challenges of adolescents in secondary schools in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey design was employed. Data were collected from 376 students from five public senior high schools within Cape Coast Metropolis via a multistage sampling procedure. The data were analysed using means, independent samples t-test and multiple linear regression. The results revealed that the most prevailing social challenges students experience are feeling of rejection by friends, fear or concern about the future, and feeling of not being attracted to the opposite sex. This study provides preliminary understanding into a group of adolescent students that are more susceptible to social challenges. Female adolescent, early adolescent, students without residence on campus and students in their final year of study are more likely to experience social challenges than other groups. Moreover, the study revealed that students prefer seeking help from teachers and parents rather than school counsellors.
