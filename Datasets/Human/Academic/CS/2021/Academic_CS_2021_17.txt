Abstract:
Investigations towards studying terrorist activities 
have recently attracted a great amount of research interest. In this paper, we 
investigate the use of the Apriori algorithm on the Global Terrorism Database 
(GTD) for forensic investigation purposes. Recently, the Apriori algorithm, 
which could be considered a forensic tool, has been used to study terrorist activities and 
patterns across the world. As such, our motivation is to utilise the Apriori 
algorithm approach on the GTD to study terrorist activities and the areas/states 
in Nigeria with high frequencies of terrorist activities. We observe that the 
most preferred method of terrorist attacks in Nigeria is through armed assault. 
Again, our experiment shows that attacks in Nigeria are mostly successful. 
Also, we observe from our investigations that most terrorists in Nigeria are 
not suicidal. The main application of this work can be used by forensic experts 
to assist law enforcement agencies in decision making when handling terrorist 
attacks in Nigeria.
