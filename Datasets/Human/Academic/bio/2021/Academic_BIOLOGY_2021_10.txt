Abstract:
Targeted covalent
inhibitors are powerful entities in drug discovery, but their application has
so far mainly been limited to addressing cysteine residues. The development of
cysteine-directed covalent inhibitors has largely profited from determining
their proteome-wide selectivity using competitive residue-specific proteomics. Several
probes have recently been described to monitor other amino acids using this
technology and many more electrophiles exist to modify proteins. Nevertheless,
a direct, proteome‑wide comparison of the selectivity of diverse probes is
still entirely missing. Here, we developed a completely unbiased workflow to analyse
electrophile selectivity proteome‑wide and applied it to directly compare 54 alkyne
probes containing diverse reactive groups. In this way, we verified and newly identified
probes to monitor a total of nine different amino acids as well as the N‑terminus
proteome‑wide. This selection includes the first probes to globally monitor
tryptophans, histidines and arginines as well as novel tailored probes for
methionines, aspartates and glutamates.
