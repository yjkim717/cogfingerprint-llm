Abstract:
Deep molecular profiling of biological tissues is an indicator of health and disease. We used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to acquire spatially resolved 20-plex protein data in tissue sections from normal and chronic tonsillitis cases. We present SpatialViz, a suite of algorithms to explore spatial relationships in multiplexed tissue images by visualizing and quantifying single-cell granularity and anatomical complexity in diverse multiplexed tissue imaging data. Single-cell and spatial maps confirmed that CD68+ cells were correlated with the enhanced Granzyme B expression and CD3+ cells exhibited enrichment of CD4+ phenotype in chronic tonsillitis. SpatialViz revealed morphological distributions of cellular organizations in distinct anatomical areas, spatially resolved single-cell associations across anatomical categories, and distance maps between the markers. Spatial topographic maps showed the unique organization of different tissue layers. The spatial reference framework generated network-based comparisons of multiplex data from healthy and diseased tonsils. SpatialViz is broadly applicable to multiplexed tissue biology. Allam, Hu, et al. present SpatialViz, a suite of algorithms to explore spatial relationships in multiplexed tissue images by visualizing and quantifying single-cell granularity and anatomical complexity in diverse multiplexed tissue imaging data. The authors employ SpatialViz on 20-plex protein data in tissue sections from normal and chronic tonsillitis cases and observe GrB and CD86 coexpression and CD3 + CD4+ enrichment in diseased tonsils compared to healthy tonsils, and demonstrate the utility of SpatialViz as a wide-application spatial visualization method.
