Abstract:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common aggressive carcinoma types worldwide, characterized by unfavorable curative effect and poor prognosis. Epidemiological data re-vealed that CRC risk is increased in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its serum components (e.g., hyperglycemia). High glycemic index diets, which chronically raise post-prandial blood glucose, may at least in part increase colon cancer risk via the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway. However, the underlying mechanisms linking IGF-1 and MetS are still poorly understood. Hyperactivated glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) are considered as a one of six hallmarks of cancer, including CRC. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling during the acquisition of the Warburg metabolic phenotypes by CRC cells is still poorly understood. It most likely results from the interaction of multiple processes, directly or indirectly regulated by IGF-1, such as activation of PI3K/Akt/mTORC, and Raf/MAPK signaling pathways, activation of glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT1), activation of key glycolytic enzymes (e.g., LDHA, LDH5, HK II, and PFKFB3), aberrant expression of the oncogenes (e.g., MYC, and KRAS) and/or overexpression of signaling proteins (e.g., HIF-1, TGF-Î²1, PI3K, ERK, Akt, and mTOR). This review describes the role of IGF-1 in glucose metabolism in physiology and colorectal carcinogenesis, including the role of the insulin/IGF system in the Warburg effect. Furthermore, current therapeutic strategies aimed at repairing impaired glucose metabolism in CRC are indicated.
