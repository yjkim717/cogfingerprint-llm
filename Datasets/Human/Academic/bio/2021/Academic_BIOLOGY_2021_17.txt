Abstract:
Background: Psychiatric problem is as common as among the 25% of the general population and 15% patients attending specialty clinic. Majority of the cases are dealt by primary care physician at the first contact, but there is only 2 weeks of clinical posting and 20 h of theory classes during MBBS course. Earlier studies have reported low attendance during the posting and theory classes. There are few studies on this aspect. On this background, the present study was planned. Methodology: One hundred 8th semester students of MBBS from two medical colleges (Group A government aided college and Group B from Private college under autonomous university) from the same locality of Central Maharashtra were selected for the study after due approval by the Institutional Ethical Committee. Questionnaire was prepared by the psychiatric faculty of both institutes and administered to the individual students. The data were analyzed using suitable statistical methods (Chi-square test and t-test). Results: Only 27% of the students in Group A attended 25%–30% of clinical posting, whereas none of them attended a single theory class. While in Group B, 1/3rd of students attended 30%–40% of clinical posting and 20%–25% of theory class. No separate examination in the subject (88%–94%) and adjustment of attendance in the other major subjects (64–86%) were cited as main reasons for nonattendance among the majority of the students in both the groups. Conclusion: Strict adherence to the attendance by the institutional authority, increase in the training hours and separate examination in the subject at undergraduate level may help in improving the attendance and change in attitude of the students toward psychiatry.
