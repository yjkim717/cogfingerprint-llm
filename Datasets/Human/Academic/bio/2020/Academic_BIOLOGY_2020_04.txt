Abstract:
There is a supply-demand gap of about 65 lakh allied health professionals in India. With India facing a heavy burden of disease with many challenges as achieving millennium development goals, shortage of skilled manpower will be a great hurdle for the health care delivery system. In such a situation, Allied Health workers can play a major role in providing holistic health services to the community. Though many institutions or Universities in India are generating allied healthcare professionals, there is no uniformity in the outcome of such professionals. There is no standardization of this professional till date. Hence, to establish a Centralized council is a need of an hour so that all such programs will come under a common platform and generated manpower will be able to provide the necessary services to the community. In this article, some suggestions are provided to improve the quality of AHPs, like estimation of workforce according to WHO requirement, uniformity in curricula, common nomenclature for all programs, creating job opportunities in private and public sectors etc.
