Abstract:
Dielectric metasurfaces, composed of planar arrays of subwavelength dielectric structures that collectively mimic the operation of conventional bulk optical elements, have revolutionized the field of optics by their potential in constructing high-efficiency and multi-functional optoelectronic systems on chip. The performance of a dielectric metasurface is largely determined by its constituent material, which is highly desired to have a high refractive index, low optical loss and wide bandgap, and at the same time, be fabrication friendly. Here, we present a new material platform based on tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) for implementing high-performance dielectric metasurface optics over the ultraviolet and visible spectral region. This wide-bandgap dielectric, exhibiting a high refractive index exceeding 2.1 and negligible extinction coefficient across a broad spectrum, can be easily deposited over large areas with good quality using straightforward physical vapor deposition, and patterned into high-aspect-ratio subwavelength nanostructures through commonly-available fluorine-gas-based reactive ion etching. We implement a series of high-efficiency ultraviolet and visible metasurfaces with representative light-field modulation functionalities including polarization-independent high-numerical-aperture lensing, spin-selective hologram projection, and vivid structural color generation, and the devices exhibit operational efficiencies up to 80%. Our work overcomes limitations faced by scalability of commonly-employed metasurface dielectrics and their operation into the visible and ultraviolet spectral range, and provides a novel route towards realization of high-performance, robust and foundry-manufacturable metasurface optics.
