Abstract:
Topology is a promising approach toward to the light ring in a generic black hole background, and equatorial timelike circular orbit in a stationary black hole background. In this paper, we consider the distinct topological configurations of the timelike circular orbits in static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotic flat black holes. By making use of the equation of motion of the massive particles, we construct a vector with its zero points exactly relating with the timelike circular orbits. Since each zero point of the vector can be endowed with a winding number, the topology of the timelike circular orbits is well established. Stable and unstable timelike circular orbits respectively have winding number +1 and -1. In particular, for given angular momentum, the topological number of the timelike circular orbits also vanishes whether they are rotating or not. Moreover, we apply the study to the Schwarzschild, scalarized Einstein-Maxwell, and dyonic black holes, which have three distinct topological configurations, representations of the radius and angular momentum relationship, with one or two pairs timelike circular orbits at most. It is shown that although the existence of scalar hair and quasi-topological term leads to richer topological configurations of the timelike circular orbits, they have no influence on the total topological number. These results indicate that the topological approach indeed provides us a novel way to understand the timelike circular orbits. Significantly, different topological configurations can share the same topology number, and hence belong to the same topological class. More information is expected to be disclosed when other different topological configurations are present.
