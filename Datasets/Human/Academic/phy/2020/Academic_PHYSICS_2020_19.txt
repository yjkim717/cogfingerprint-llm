Abstract:
We reveal that dielectric metasurfaces can perform tailored non-Hermitian transformations optimized for monitoring of deviations around arbitrarily linear, circular, or elliptical polarizations, delivering the amplified vertical-to-horizontal polarization ratios for sensitive single-shot detection.
