Abstract:
A dielectric-metasurface-enabled pulse shaper able to tailor the temporal instantaneous polarization states within a near-infrared femtosecond pulse is demonstrated. Simultaneous complex wavefront shaping has been implemented by exploiting metasurfacesâ€™ multi-functionalities within a single-pixel.
