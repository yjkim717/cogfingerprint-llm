Abstract:
Background The Syrian conflict has had a massive impact on the dental health of refugees. Dental extraction is a good indicator of socioeconomic position and degree of oral hygiene, however there is a scarcity of evidence in the scientific literature that characterizes the reasons for extraction in refugees. Aims and methods The current study looked at the extraction causes and related sociodemographic variables of 322 Syrian refugees (46.3% females, 53.7% males) who were treated in a dental clinic in Zaatari camp (Jordan), from September to December 2019. All child Syrian refugees (aged 4–16) visiting the facility were eligible to participate. A validated semi-structured survey was used to collect clinical and sociodemographic data from the research sample. Chi-square test, Independent sample t-test, and ANOVA test were used to examine associations between the different variables. The significance level was set at P  < 0.05. Results The total number of teeth extracted was 397: 25 (6.3%) permanent teeth, 371 (93.5%) primary teeth, and one mesiodens (0.2%). Overall, lower teeth were most commonly extracted (56.9%). The most common teeth that required extraction were the lower primary molars, with lower left primary second molars being the most commonly extracted (15.9%). As the level of parental education increased, the mean number of extracted teeth decreased ( P  = 0.035), additionally, as the frequency of toothbrushing increased extractions due to caries decreased significantly ( P  = 0.027). Conclusions Dental caries and pulpal diseases were discovered to be the most prevalent causes for primary and permanent tooth extraction, with no difference between males and females. The lower left primary molar was the most commonly afflicted tooth.
