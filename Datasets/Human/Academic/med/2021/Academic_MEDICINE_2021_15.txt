Abstract:
Pulmonary hamartoma is the most common benign tumor of the lungs. It is most often asymptomatic and is discovered incidentally. The condition is two to three times more common in men and is usually seen in the sixth to seventh decade of life. The authors present the case of a 44-year-old female in whom the condition was symptomatic, causing cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. This case is unusual in that it occurred in a woman in her 40s and was symptomatic. The authors discuss the presentation, clinical features, and management of pulmonary hamartoma.
