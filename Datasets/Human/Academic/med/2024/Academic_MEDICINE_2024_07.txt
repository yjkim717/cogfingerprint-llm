Abstract:
Abstract The 2016 and 2021 World Health Organization 2021 Classification of central nervous system tumors have resulted in a major improvement in the classification of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas. With more effective treatments many patients experience prolonged survival. However, treatment guidelines are often still based on information from historical series comprising both patients with IDH wild-type and IDH-mutant tumors. They provide recommendations for radiotherapy and chemotherapy for so-called high-risk patients, usually based on residual tumor after surgery and age over 40. More up-to-date studies give a better insight into clinical, radiological, and molecular factors associated with the outcome of patients with IDH-mutant glioma. These insights should be used today for risk stratification and for treatment decisions. In many patients with IDH-mutant grades 2 and 3 glioma, if carefully monitored postponing radiotherapy and chemotherapy is safe, and will not jeopardize the overall outcome of patients. With the INDIGO trial showing patient benefit from the IDH inhibitor vorasidenib, there is a sizable population in which it seems reasonable to try this class of agents before recommending radio-chemotherapy with its delayed adverse event profile affecting quality of survival. Ongoing trials should help to further identify the patients that are benefiting from this treatment.
