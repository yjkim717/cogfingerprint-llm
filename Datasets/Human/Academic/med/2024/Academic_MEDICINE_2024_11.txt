Abstract:
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tumor segmentation is essential in surgical and treatment planning and response assessment and monitoring in pediatric brain tumors, the leading cause of cancer-related death among children. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and has high interoperator variability, underscoring the need for more efficient methods. After training, we compared 2 deep-learning-based 3D segmentation models, DeepMedic and nnU-Net, with pediatric-specific multi-institutional brain tumor data based on multiparametric MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiparametric preoperative MR imaging scans of 339 pediatric patients (n = 293 internal and n = 46 external cohorts) with a variety of tumor subtypes were preprocessed and manually segmented into 4 tumor subregions, ie, enhancing tumor, nonenhancing tumor, cystic components, and peritumoral edema. After training, performances of the 2 models on internal and external test sets were evaluated with reference to ground truth manual segmentations. Additionally, concordance was assessed by comparing the volume of the subregions as a percentage of the whole tumor between model predictions and ground truth segmentations using the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients and the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: The mean Dice score for nnU-Net internal test set was 0.9 (SD, 0.07) (median, 0.94) for whole tumor; 0.77 (SD, 0.29) for enhancing tumor; 0.66 (SD, 0.32) for nonenhancing tumor; 0.71 (SD, 0.33) for cystic components, and 0.71 (SD, 0.40) for peritumoral edema, respectively. For DeepMedic, the mean Dice scores were 0.82 (SD, 0.16) for whole tumor; 0.66 (SD, 0.32) for enhancing tumor; 0.48 (SD, 0.27) for nonenhancing tumor; 0.48 (SD, 0.36) for cystic components, and 0.19 (SD, 0.33) for peritumoral edema, respectively. Dice scores were significantly higher for nnU-Net (P ≤ .01). Correlation coefficients for tumor subregion percentage volumes were higher (0.98 versus 0.91 for enhancing tumor, 0.97 versus 0.75 for nonenhancing tumor, 0.98 versus 0.80 for cystic components, 0.95 versus 0.33 for peritumoral edema in the internal test set). Bland-Altman plots were better for nnU-Net compared with DeepMedic. External validation of the trained nnU-Net model on the multi-institutional Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge in Pediatrics (BraTS-PEDs) 2023 data set revealed high generalization capability in the segmentation of whole tumor, tumor core (a combination of enhancing tumor, nonenhancing tumor, and cystic components), and enhancing tumor with mean Dice scores of 0.87 (SD, 0.13) (median, 0.91), 0.83 (SD, 0.18) (median, 0.89), and 0.48 (SD, 0.38) (median, 0.58), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pediatric-specific data-trained nnU-Net model is superior to DeepMedic for whole tumor and subregion segmentation of pediatric brain tumors.
