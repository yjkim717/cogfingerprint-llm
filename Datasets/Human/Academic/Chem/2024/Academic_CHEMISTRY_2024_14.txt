Abstract:
In the last quarter-century, the field of molecular dynamics (MD) has undergone a remarkable transformation, propelled by substantial enhancements in software, hardware, and underlying methodologies. In this Perspective, we contemplate the future trajectory of MD simulations and their possible look at the year 2050. We spotlight the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in shaping the future of MD and the broader field of computational physical chemistry. We outline critical strategies and initiatives that are essential for the seamless integration of such technologies. Our discussion delves into topics like multiscale modeling, adept management of ever-increasing data deluge, the establishment of centralized simulation databases, and the autonomous refinement, cross-validation, and self-expansion of these repositories. The successful implementation of these advancements requires scientific transparency, a cautiously optimistic approach to interpreting AI-driven simulations and their analysis, and a mindset that prioritizes knowledge-motivated research alongside AI-enhanced big data exploration. While history reminds us that the trajectory of technological progress can be unpredictable, this Perspective offers guidance on preparedness and proactive measures, aiming to steer future advancements in the most beneficial and successful direction.
