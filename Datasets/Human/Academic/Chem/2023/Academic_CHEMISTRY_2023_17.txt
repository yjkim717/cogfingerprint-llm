Abstract:
Atomistic simulations of matter, especially those that leverage first-principles (ab initio) electronic structure theory, provide a microscopic view of the world, underpinning much of our understanding of chemistry and materials science. Over the last decade or so, machine-learned force fields have transformed atomistic modeling by enabling simulations of ab initio quality over unprecedented time and length scales. However, early ML force fields have largely been limited by: (i) the substantial computational and human effort of developing and validating potentials for each particular system of interest; and (ii) a general lack of transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here we show that it is possible to create a general-purpose atomistic ML model, trained on a public dataset of moderate size, that is capable of running stable molecular dynamics for a wide range of molecules and materials. We demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model - and its qualitative and at times quantitative accuracy - on a diverse set of problems in the physical sciences, including properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical reactions, interfaces and even the dynamics of a small protein. The model can be applied out of the box as a starting or"foundation"model for any atomistic system of interest and, when desired, can be fine-tuned on just a handful of application-specific data points to reach ab initio accuracy. Establishing that a stable force-field model can cover almost all materials changes atomistic modeling in a fundamental way: experienced users get reliable results much faster, and beginners face a lower barrier to entry. Foundation models thus represent a step towards democratising the revolution in atomic-scale modeling that has been brought about by ML force fields.
