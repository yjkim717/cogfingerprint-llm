Hi guys, I'm keen to get into windsurfing this year, I have a sailing background but no windsurfing experience. There's quite a lot of kitesurfing activity where I live and I've seen people wingfoiling too. I can't decide whether I should jump into wingfoiling or windsurfing. I love the idea of wingfoiling being easier to transport but I'm a bit worried that it will feel slow and maybe more of a gimmick than windsurfing. I don't live in an area with big waves or anything so there's no surfing scene, I just like the idea of zipping around and having a good time. Does anyone have any opinions of which they would get into if you were me? As we get into the season I hope to catch some of the people I've seen wingboarding to quiz them on it but thought I'd ask here because I want the opinion from a group that don't already have their heart (and wallets) set on wingfoiling
