When MM and starlight find out about butcher and hugie using temp compound V, they act all righteous, and cry how "no one is supposed to have that kind of power" I can understand starlight's position a bit, cause hugie is insecure about their relationship (he was real jealous aof supersonic) and she felt upset knowing that he didn't basically trust her. But still, to me, it feels real similar to the whole "if you kill the bad guy, you're no better than he is!" nonsense. I don't even agree wtih the whole "we're compromising our morals by using compound V". If there are two bad guys, and one person kills the other, that still makes fewer bad guys in the world. That's a good thing. And even then, hugie/butcher aren't guys that want everyone to worship them, or will kill people who disagree with them. And I don't understand the plan of "no one should have that power". What are you going to do? Throw all the compound V in the ocean? And even if you did that, people will just make new compound V. Why? Cause the knowledge exists. To me, it just seems like a cheap way to create tension among the boys.
