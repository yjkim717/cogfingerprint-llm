Hi all, I was dead set on buying a new 2023 Mazda CX-5. Test drove it and loved it. My wife thought it was a little tight feeling, but ultimately thought it was good enough. Unfortunately, we didn't even consider the fact that an infant car seat or a rear facing car seat would make it even more uncomfortable. After reading reviews online, watching videos, etc. I don't think the CX-5 is going to fit my family's needs after all... which I'm very disappointed about as I loved it. I think we will want something that offers a bit more room. Some options I'm considering are a Rav4, CRV, or possibly just going up to a CX-9. The CX-9 seems like a decent option, but not sure I like it as much as the CX-5. It's quite a bit pricier and I'm not sure we really will need the third row. The Rav4 and CRV seem to have a bit better room when it comes to car seats, but not by a great deal. Anything that you would recommend that would keep the price below 40k for new and would offer enough leg room for passengers even with a car seat in the back? Not sure I'm quite ready for a mini van. Thanks. Forgot to mention, I'm in the US.
