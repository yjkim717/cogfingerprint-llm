I’m trying to cut out coffee (I drink around 10-15 cups a day). I’ve always loved tea though I want something strong to replace the nagging addiction to drinking something hot and highly caffeinated. Looking for a black tea as high in caffeine as possible that’s capable of standing up to a tablespoon or two of milk. Massively prefer loose-leaf. Willing to pay for quality but would prefer the total price of a cup to be under $1.50 USD.
