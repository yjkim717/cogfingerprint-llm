In the next few weeks my family and I will be making a tough decision. My wife and I are approaching middle age and have a 4yo and a 7 month kid. We are currently in the Midwest United States away from our families. We are waiting on a Job offer for my wife that may take us back closer to our families. We would be 60-90 min away from multiple pockets of families as opposed to 10-12hr drive. Cost of living would sky rocket and we may actually have to move in with my in laws for a while (good people). There's a lot to gain for my family, my kid would get to see their cousins a lot more for instance, but frankly I'm terrified about giving up my social circle here. We have amazing friends I never thought I would have. This new location wouldn't necessarily put me in the same cities as family and we would have to start from scratch. I don't know how to make new friends in my late 30s. I'm fairly introverted but I go through several bouts of depression and anxiety a year, having a close group of friends really centers me. I'm terrified of taking my daughter away from her friends, especially since there are zero kids around my in laws. She loves her school and loves her teachers. Some of our friends have become family to me. I don't know how to let them go for my sake and for my daughter's sake. I'm just scared and I can't think this through. I'm tired and I'm broken up over all of this. And due to my baby teething I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks.
