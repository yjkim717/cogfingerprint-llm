Hi all so for the last few months I've been studying and reading Japanese for at least 5 to 10 minutes (while working) a day with playing Japanese games (although with subs) and doing a lesson (where each class my Japanese teacher will only speak Japanese and we use little English) privately (for an hour every fortnight) but I'm afraid I'm not taking much in. I did a thread back in the beginning of the year talking about me going from Korean to Japanese but have been constantly been anxious due to how much I spend learning. I haven't even missed a day of doing 5 minutes exercises through dualingo but that's with me constantly practicing to read Hiragana however I haven't touched Katakana. &#x200B; My main problem is my lack of motivation and although I do have things I want to do (Japanese learning) but it's just been difficult finding the energy to learn (after or even before work). I'm currently going through Genki (with my lessons from my tutor) and using the Manga way so I can practice when I'm not in work. &#x200B; What I'm asking is, is there anything that might help further my Japanese without the need to feel stress for doing something I have passion in but also having little time or is it best to keep doing little exercises everyday just to build up my knowledge further and further?
