Hi all, I have been driving for a better part of almost a year now (learning in my parent's car and my instructors car for well over 100 hours now). My theory just ran out and I'm doing it again tomorrow. Been revising an hour each day for the last 2 days. Initially I was going to do it again in a few months but my instructor and parent have told me to get on with it as they know I can drive and to get my practical in as soon as I can get my theory done. I have the DVSA app and been passing it with 44/43 with my average score being 41. As for my hazard it's been on average with 4 and 5's with an occasional 3 (1 in 10 clips) so I'm not worried on that part. Does anyone have any tips for it besides just push push push.
