Hey guys. So my friend is planning to come out to her conservative family sometime soon. She's been under pressure to marry and feels it's finally time to let them know where she stands. Since she comes from an Indian business family, she's apprehensive about how to put it to them. Obv it's impossible to control the reaction, but she wants to do the best she can to avoid a big blowup. Is there anyone on the forum who's done something like this before? Any tips?
