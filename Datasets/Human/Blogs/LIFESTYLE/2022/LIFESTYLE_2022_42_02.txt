I work in a meat department and since its 4th of July weekend we have been extremely busy cutting steaks and for some reason every few minutes someone comes through the door and asks for a special order usually they want their steaks sliced a certain way or they want something that we don’t have on the shelf (even though we have a shit ton of variety). I’m getting so annoyed with these special requests. We do not have time to be cutting anything extra. Why can’t they just take what’s on the shelf and be happy?? Don’t see what you want on the shelf ? Then leave and go somewhere else instead of trying to get me to do it on one of the busiest weekends of the year.
