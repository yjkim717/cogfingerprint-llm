I am sooo happy for her. Her new family is sooo excited and constantly prepping her play pen and getting her toys and asking "is this bunny safe", "will she like this", in prep for this weekend. but on the other hand, i am an emotional mess. I am going to miss her soooo much. She was my first foster and this is SO HARD. I love her so much and want the very very very best for her. I couldnt adopt her cause she and my bunny just dont get along and I dont have enough space to have 2 separate setups and then find both bondmates.
