I'm an idiot and I opened a credit card that ultimately will not work for me. I'm trying to pay down debt and get myself into a better financial situation. However, now I realize that having this AmEx card isn't going to work for me as I was going to primarily use it for work purchases but they take longer than a month to reimburse me and I don't always have the funds to pay it off myself. How much damage will I do if I go ahead and close this card right away?
