I have a small, side business that I’ve been mainly cash based with a credit card of only $10k limit. They actually moved me down since I didn’t use enough credit for the limit they had. Annual revenues are small, under $40k so I never needed anything large for credit and never made large purchases like this so cash is an issue here also. I have an opportunity for a government contract that is right up my alley way in terms of requirements. My issue is product acquisition since the total cost of product would be $285,000. I’m not sure NET30 terms would cover it as from experience the government can take 60-90 days to pay, and not sure my vendors would even grant that amount for me. What would be a way to secure this?
