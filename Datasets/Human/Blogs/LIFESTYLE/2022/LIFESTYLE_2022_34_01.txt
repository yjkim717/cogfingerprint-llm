Currently on the lowest family health plan I pay $308/week with a projected increase of 20% in March. I work, 2 kids and wife is stay at home mom. _I_ don't need health insurance (veteran). Wife and kids do. I sourced a plan just for wife and kids for $173/week with better overall deductibles. I fell into the 22% tax bracket in 2021 and should be the same in 2022 and use the standard deduction. I am always usually about $10k off the standard if I do itemized even with the almost $4k I could deduct for medical expenses (self-sourced premiums @ 7.5% over AGI). I'm trying to determine if doing the self-sourced plan vs employer plan would pay off in the long run. I know I lose the pre-tax benefit with employer sponsored, but it doesn't seem like paying $16k vs $7k per year for the health insurance would be made up by taxes. Meaning I don't think I'm going to pay an additional $9,000 in taxes by losing the pre-payroll tax deduction for employer health insurance. What am I missing?
