Does anyone have any suggestions? Unfortunately I tend to find the majority of contemporary-written Regency Romances tend to be more "Bridgerton" than "Austen" - which isn't to say they're not enjoyable, but I'd like something a bit more authentic if possible. Authors I like include Barbara Cartland (but hers can be a little bit "light") and Elizabeth Rolls. Thanks so much for any recommendations! EDIT to create a list for others who are interested, I'll add the great suggestions here: * Mimi Matthews (Victorian) * Loretta Chase * Stella Riley * Jude Morgan * Anna Dean (mystery with dash of romance) * Sophie Holloway * Sheila Walsh * Joan Wolf * Mary Kingswood ("Drawing room not bedroom") * Carla Kelly (late Georgian Era) * Mary Balogh (reissues are cleaner) * Patricia Veryan * Miranda Davis * Judith McNaught
