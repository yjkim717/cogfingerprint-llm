If I've been predicted an AAC for the UCAS application process, will I be restricted to mediocre universities because of that C, or will I be able to apply for higher level universities assuming that I could surpass that C in the actual exam? I know this has probably been asked a thousand times, but I missed my UCAS information day at my sixth form and thought this sub would be the best place to ask. Thank you in advance.
