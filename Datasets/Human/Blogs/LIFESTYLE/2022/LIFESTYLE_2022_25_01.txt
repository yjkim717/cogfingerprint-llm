I don't know if this post belongs here so please redirect me if it does not. Last night I was working for Doordash and was involved in a car accident. I was stopped at a flashing red, looked both ways not seeing anybody, and started to pull into the intersection. A car coming from my left through the flashing yellow came out of nowhere and swerved to avoid me, scratching the front of my car and damaging hers. 911 was called and the police came to make a report, but I was wondering if anyone knew the laws for flashing yellows (the one she sped through) and deciding fault. I know I can just wait for the police report but the whole situation has me stressed as I know insurance companies do not like Doordash in the first place.
