What audio dramas have terrified you? Im a huge fan of horror but haven't found an audio drama to keep me going in a while. I really enjoyed the first few episodes of Tribulation. That terrified me. I enjoyed the Video Palace. I know what terrifies you is subjective, but I'd love some suggestions. Id like something that isn't tongue in cheek. Something that takes its own world seriously. Thanks in advance.
