So I was fishing at the Bob Sikes Cut last week, I guess it was during out going tide. I saw this giant, with dark tail, keep swimming up to the surface. My guess is something like 60 lbs about 50 inches. I tried everything but no luck. Finally I casted my SP across the cut, damn he/she told it at the very first cast. I got about 3 to 4 reels in, it broken off. So without see the full fish, I guess it is either snook or red fish, which one has a dark tail? It was swimming against the current, that is why I think it is a snook. I have no idea. &#x200B; Also, I was using 20 lbs braid, with TA clip to SP Minnow, that damn fish took my SP and the TA clip. It broke at the knot. I was using Improved clinch knot. is that the correct knot for braid to TA clip? &#x200B; ###
