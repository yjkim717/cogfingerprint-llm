Happy Talent Tuesday, Fellow Sobernauts! In this post we celebrate anything you do or anything you've created in sobriety. Like to rock climb? Brag on! Made a first attempt at skywriting? Show it off in a few pictures down below! Learning to cook? Awesome! Show us! My talent is getting this post out the door despite spending the whole day swimming, playing, and watching fireworks with my kiddos. All while staying sober! So, that's it for me. How about you? What have _you_ been up to? I can't wait to hear it! I Will Not Drink But Instead Create Something With You Today (IWNDBICSWYT)!
