Sorry for the rant I just wanted to say it somewhere lol. I'm normally the type of person to be happy about anything promoting veganism regardless of ties to meat products (I.e. mcdonalds making a vegan burger). However TV chefs do my head in, they are all starting to do one off specials promoting vegan food but then the next day I see them on tv again back to chucking lobster in a pan and not giving it a second thought. It just feels way too disingenuous to me. Also, I hate how they come on tv and act like they have invented some vegan recipe but it's actually the work of some very creative people that have been coming up with clever meat substitutes for years before them.
