Our garage door is stopping before it is all of the way open and sometimes it is not closing all of the way. For example, I'll hit the opener and it will only go up 1-2 inches. Then I'll hit it again, and it will go up 1-2 inches more. If I hold it, it will continue until I let go of the button. On closing, sometimes it closes all of the way. Sometimes it will close, but stop 1-2 inches before the ground. Both of these behaviors are sporadic and inconsistent. More interesting, it "thinks" it is all the way down. If you are opening it after it did not close entirely, the opener carriage will run into the motor (bad). We have tried resetting the thresholds for open/closed twice since this problem started. We have had some situations with the garage door in its short life: In September, my husband was antsy about latching the garage door shut the day we were leaving for vacation. He latched (a lever that pushes through on one side rail and stops the wheels passing) as he stepped in front of the beam that triggered the door to re-open. This caused the opener to pull hard and bend the track where the chain is. Luckily I was walking into the garage as this happened, and I hit the button on the wall to stop further damage. We have since replaced the middle track & chain (it came together). Things were working fine from Sept-Dec. In November, we had the floor epoxied. We had to leave the garage door cracked open above the freshly epoxied floor for a few days. No major issues occurred after - I wouldn't think this would cause issues, either. There aren't any major squeaks or groans when it goes up or down. It's a little rattily with the new part, but we went from a solid chain-drive to a 3-part one we had to assemble. It doesn't seem unreasonable. Any help or suggestions are appreciated!
