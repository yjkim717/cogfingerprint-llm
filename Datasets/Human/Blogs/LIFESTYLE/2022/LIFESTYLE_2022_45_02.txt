I locked in a rate for 30 days with my lender and the home still hasn't closed so now I'm being hit with a $345 extension fee which is equivalent to raising the loan .375% (it's a 92k loan at 3.625%). This will extend the lock for another 15 days. Do I have any leverage here to not pay the fee to extend the lock? I think the home will close in the next 2-3 weeks, I don't want to be hit with another fee. Could I just not lock it and "let it ride" aka gamble that the loan rate will be the same at the time of closing and not have gone up? It's my first property so i'm fairly inexperienced.
