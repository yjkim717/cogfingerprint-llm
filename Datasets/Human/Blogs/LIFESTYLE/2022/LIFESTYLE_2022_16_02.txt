I tried setting the ingame historical paths, germany and all central europe (minus Italy because it doenst have a democracy path). But then UK went fascist even tho I had historical focuses on, then allied with italy and started their own war vs allies (france + free uk and dominions). So it basically ruined the whole thing, because I want to be the the only big bad boss agains the world. Are there mods or something to get there?
