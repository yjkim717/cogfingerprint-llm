I don’t feel like Andor is likely for a weekly recap since it’s 12 episodes, but they have done every Star Wars show so far. Maybe a season recap of House of the Dragon recap like they did with Game of thrones, although Ik Steve (or was it Andrew) never kept up with game of thrones. So what show do you think (or hope) they’ll recap next on Patreon?
