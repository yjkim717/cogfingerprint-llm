Hi everyone, I'm a recent graduate working in a software company as SDE-1. Since so many of you are experienced and have contacts with successful people, I thought it'd be a good place to ask for guidance. I want to pursue higher education in CS, and eventually settle abroad. I'm absolutely clueless as no one in my friends and family has done that. I have few questions; I'll be more than grateful to have them answered. 1. I've been considering USA, but which country would be good where I can earn high, and eventually stay there. 2. How do I start preparing for test? I don't know where to start, can anyone please be my mentor? 3. Scholarship possible?
