I am lucky that my mom and brother are going to design and make my dress. My brother is a fashion designer and his taste is impeccable so $0 for gown since they are going to pay for it. Plus, we are doing an intimate wedding inour backyard so no cost for venue. With that said, I allocate the budget for venue+gown to wedding planner and photographer instead. The wed planner was a bit pricey but I thought its worth it considering we dont want any of our family member to be busy and cant enjoy our wedding day. This happens at my brother in law’s wedding and sadly enough, all the immediate family didnt really have a good memory about it so trying to avoid that. Now that we have room to hire a photographer for our wedding, what do you guys think I should pay for 6 hrs event? I have one that offers $4000 including engagement photo. $2700 just for the wedding. The thing is my partner and I are traveling to Indonesia next year to meet my family so im thinking to do the engagement photo there. Bonust question: How do you guys find your photographer? What are the criteria that you are looking? Thanks a bunch and thank you so much for this community for having amazing ideas for weddings under budget! Edit: I’m located in Georgia
