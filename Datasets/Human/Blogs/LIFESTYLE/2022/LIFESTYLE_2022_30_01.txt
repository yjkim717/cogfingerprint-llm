I was re-rewatching and in S04E02 I noticed that Lee Garner Jr got a Polaroid at the Christmas party. I tried to take a screen cap but it came out black due to copyright protection. The scene is ~34 minutes into the episode for those that care. I happen to have one of these antique cameras, which was given to me by my grandfather before he passed away. It's not the exact same model (mine is a Land Camera model 360, which was manufactured 1969-1971, ~5 years after action in this episode. Lee got a 100 Series made 1963-1967. But the mechanics are the same. Here's a gallery of mine. The camera is in its folded form, with lens attachments and a place to mount flashbulbs indicated with the red arrow. I last used my camera about 20 years ago, back when you could still buy film for it. They stopped making peel-apart film ~10 years ago, so there is literally no way to buy film for it, aside from unopened old stock, which is real dicey because the developing chemicals are expired and are unlikely to work. When it was functional and you could buy film, to use it you have to pull out this retractable light shield (not sure what it's made of). It has cracked over the years and I will not be opening it again out of fear of further damage. I'm guessing the camera in the show is a prop because there's no way an antique would look this good or open correctly. Anyway, I was just pleased as punch to see this gem of a camera, which I have in my closet.
