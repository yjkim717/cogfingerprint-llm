Maybe I'm the idiot here. When ordering my Pixel 7 + Pixel Watch I selected trade-in and was offered $905 for my iPhone. In addition to a 10% maps discount code the phone + watch were basically "free" , at least per the Google Store order screen. Now that Google has finally received and processed my trade it appears the credit is only applying to the phone. Meanwhile I'll get a Google Store credit for the excess value and presumably still make payments for the watch. Screenshot I didn't screenshot the trade-in order screen so I guess I've got nothing to prove what seems like deceptive sales tactics. I could have sworn the trade credit appeared to apply against my entire cart! Is there a chance I can call or email Google to apply the credit back as a refund payment method? Or perhaps am I just better of considering this incentive to buy a bunch of watch bands....
