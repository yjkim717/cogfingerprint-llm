this is the first time i’ve had more than one textbook available through equitable access so it seems like it might be worth it. however if only one class uses them i’d rather opt out. the classes are pls 21 with sellu, george, ecn 1a with carrell, scott and psc12y with A. Jahanitabesh (this is the one i’m confused about because there is a response session included and i’m not sure what that is) thank you!!
