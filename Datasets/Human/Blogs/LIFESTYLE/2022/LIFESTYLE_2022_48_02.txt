We looked for a house for 3 years and lost count at the amount of the houses we saw. We never had a buyer's agent throughout the process so did not feel bad about wasting their time. But it just got me wondering how long is too long for a buyer's agent to spend with a buyer? As a buyer, at what point would you actually feel bad about it. As an agent when would you give up such a buyer, if at all. For the curious, we finally did end up buying a house in July 2020 and mainly saw houses via open houses. Put in 2 offers total during that time, including the one that got us the house.
