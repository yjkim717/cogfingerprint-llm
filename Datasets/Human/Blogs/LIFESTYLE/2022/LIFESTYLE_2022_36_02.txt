I use the Latin America G9600 version on Verizon. I've been having a lot of trouble with losing network connectivity which used to work fine before. All around town I'll completely lose all connectivity. I know most carriers have shut down the 3G network but 4G LTE should still work. - What variant do you use and how's your experience? - Unlocked S9 US variant users, do you have any issues and how long do you think the US version will work?
