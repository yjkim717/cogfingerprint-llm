My wife and I got married in summer 2021. I am planning to file taxes jointly but she maxed out her Roth IRA in 2021 even though, jointly we are above the limit where we can contribute to our Roth IRA's (I did backdoor for myself. But her individual salary did not put her over the limit). If I filed jointly will we be penalized for this?
