How is it possible that a seasons pass for Mt Baker costs over a $1000 and is only available for purchase during a limited time window while I can buy an Epic pass for Whistler for CA$860? Bigger mountain and the pass gives access to bunch of other resorts. Is it that the Whistler price is advertised without sales tax, but it's included in the Baker price? Thanks.
