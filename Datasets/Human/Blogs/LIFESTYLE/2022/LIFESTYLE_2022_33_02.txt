Hello, Not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this but want to talk about something that feels like a real problem here. We all know how hellish it is finding an apartment in NYC but lately it seems like every landlord has a credit score requirement of 700. I am lucky in that my mom put me as an 'authorized user' on her credit card when I was younger so I have a good credit score but this seems extremely unfair and discriminatory towards people who don't have 100% financially 'literate' parents or come from a low income family. It's also stupid in that credit scores do not indicate whatsoever whether or not someone can pay their rent on time. It's an arbitrary requirement that makes finding housing more difficult even if you can pass the income requirements. So, what is the point of putting credit score requirements on an apartment? If anything this just forces people to use credit cards even if they wouldn't need to use them otherwise. I feel like there needs to be so much more housing reform in the city to alleviate all of this unnecessary stress and barriers to people finding housing. Does anyone have an actual administrative answer to this besides wanting to discriminate against people who don't have wealthy or middle class families? Thanks
