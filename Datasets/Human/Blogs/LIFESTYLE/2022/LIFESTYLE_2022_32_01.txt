I made some homemade teriyaki sauce for the first time the other day (soy sauce, garlic, ginger, Japanese Mirin, sake) and I found that it can last an entire year in the fridge! That could supply me with flavor for an entire year! I could throw this on chicken, tofu, vegetables, rice, anything! I was wondering what else can last in the fridge for a long time. I was thinking maybe some spicy jalapeno Mexican salsa, maybe some pickled red onions? What are some LONG-LASTING sauces, pickles & salsas that just add that extra punch of flavor, enjoyment that you keep in your fridge? I'm just looking for ideas I guess! Open to all cultures!
