Feeling extremely discouraged right now because I’ve been dealing with a bad IBS flare up for about a month. I suffer from IBS-D & started a FODMAP diet a few days ago but woke up this morning with severe cramping. I have some guesses about what is causing it but am afraid I’m going to go on this diet and nothing will change. Also ordered some special probiotics and have a doctor’s appointment coming up. Has anyone managed to get their stomach problems under control?
