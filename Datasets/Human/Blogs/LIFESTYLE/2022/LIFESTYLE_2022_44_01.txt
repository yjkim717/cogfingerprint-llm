So, I wanted to remake this post with an effort to produce a more clear vision of what I'm dealing with. There are food particles with liquid extract in them. We want to get the extract out of them. They are ground into a specific size. They go into a vessel. The vessel is filled with liquid solvent. The vessel circulates the solvent from the bottom to the top. The vessel is also heated through a steam jacket, but we can control that temperature. Here is a picture I mentioned in the old post to better describe my situation BUT! Looking at the picture, it's not entirely accurate since it represents UNGROUND material. Since the material is ground, I want to try and get a model that assumes the extract is at the surface of the particle. It might not be accurate to assume this, but I want to try that angle. /u/woodsja2 made some pictures to represent what I'm describing. Another thing to note is that the particles are not freeflowing. Sure there is ciruclation, but they're not that small that they would flow around in the vessel. We can take it as packed, like catalyst pellets. Looking at some models of packed bed reactors, the factors to decide if it's mass transfer or diffusion limited is different than my situation, because those models factor in reaction rates. I'm not dealing with reactions in my situation. So I'm just trying to figure out what is a good model with these assumptions? Do I only worry about the individual particle or model on the whole packed bed?
