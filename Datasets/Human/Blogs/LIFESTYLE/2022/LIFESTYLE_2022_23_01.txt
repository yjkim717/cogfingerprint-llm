Yo so it’s my last semester at UF. I’m taking the last two classes required for my major and then two others (EEL3872 and ALS3200C) to meet BF full-time requirements. Been looking through the sub but haven’t found much info about EEL3872 or ALS3200C with how heavy the classes are. Tell me any info you know, tips, the sorts. I only ask because I’ll be working two jobs during the semester and kind of want an idea of how the semester will pan out. Thanks!
