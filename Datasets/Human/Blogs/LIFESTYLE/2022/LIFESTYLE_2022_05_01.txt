I'm giving my PC an overhaul which so far includes a new CPU(which required a BIOS update) and a 2TB M.2 drive to replace my 110gb SSD boot drive. (RTX 3060 on its way!). Anyway, I cloned my SSD to the M.2 drive using Macrium Reflect. and am trying to set the boot order. There are options for UEFI windows boot manager( samsung 970 M.2), UEFI windows boot manager(ADATA SSD 110gb), Hard Disk (Samsung 970 M.2), and various other USB, network, and whatever other options. I set my M.2 at #1 priority and also changed it under the other menus to be the priority boot drive, but it takes forever to load. I swapped priority back to the original SSD, and bootup takes forever still. &#x200B; Should the top priority be UEFI windows boot manager(M.2) or Hard Disk(M.2)? &#x200B; I have not yet wiped the original drive, in case there was a problem with the cloning. I want to get this situated before I go ahead with deleting the OS on that drive. Edit: restored all defaults in bios(but disabled IOMMU, which seems to be required for R7 3800x to work on an x370). I think itâ€™s bios that is taking forever, not the boot drives/priority. Do I need to try another bios version or are there other settings I can play with that would speed things up? This is kind of ridiculous EDIT 2: I found out about "Last BIOS Time" in task manager... it says 19.4 seconds so, maybe it is one of my drives causing this.
