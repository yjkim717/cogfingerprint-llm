So it can be pretty lonely and isolated whenever I talked about my mood swings and problems with my friends. I have one friend who’s dad was bipolar, so she’s probably the closest thing that could understand this. My other friend who has bipolar decided to not take any medication for the past 3 years. I haven’t talked to her since then for various reasons. I guess I just wanted to vent. That is all.
