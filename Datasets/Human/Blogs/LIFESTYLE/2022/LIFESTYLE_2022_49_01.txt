Briefly, I and my SO are together for 15 years, last 4 years, I work in overseas. It was very challenging during the pandemic but we made it through. We visit each other once every 2-3 months. Normally, I'm a romantic guy and, we spend a very good time when we are together but I feel like our phone calls are dull and we can't really share much since nothing much happens; wake up, go to work, come back to home, eat, and sleep. I talk to her while commuting and once I'm back home. We also use every opportunity to talk and exchange messages during the day Would any of you guys have some tips for me to keep our phone calls more entertaining? Thank you all in advance!
