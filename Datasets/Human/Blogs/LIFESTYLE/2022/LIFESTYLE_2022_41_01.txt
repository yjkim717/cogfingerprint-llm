Listening to old Em songs and what made him my favorite artist was his lyricisms. The multi-syllabic rhyming was so impressive. Now it’s not only multiple syllables, but also 2 or 3 meanings. He’s like gotten too smart for his own good, at the detriment of his songs. Sometimes less is more. Every song seems so forgettable. It’s like “cool, this exists”, and probably never listen to it again. Like his most recent songs with Kanye, Snoop, and the Elvis one. He manages to say so much and absolutely nothing at the same time.
