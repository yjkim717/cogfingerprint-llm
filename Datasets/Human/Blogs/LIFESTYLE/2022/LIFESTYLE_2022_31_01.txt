it sucks and i get it. but emergencies dont happen when we want them to or when we have the financial situation under control. they just happen. once its used up, please replenish it and if you can, aim to add extra 1-2K to the end amount since everything has gotten so expensive. EDIT: i did not mean to offend anyone. my emergency account took a hit and i have to have to start it again. but i have to push myself to do it. i get it. not everytime we all will have leftover. i am sorry , i didnt mean to sound ignorant or offensive.
