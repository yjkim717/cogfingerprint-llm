So at Random times my gas petal will randomly stop working and my car just loses power. Usually I just pull over and start it again and sometimes it will start and immediately power down again and sometimes it’ll start and run again. It only happens every couple of weeks but once it starts it usually happens multiple times that same trip. I know it’s not the battery or alternator because all of my lights stay on and my radio continues to work (plus I just replaced the battery). I’ve taken it to multiple mechanics, even the dealership and not a single one of them were able to determine the cause of the issue. They’ve fixed multiple things on my car and none of them helped. On top of that my car has a very rough idle so that might have something to do with it. Has anyone else had simaler issues ? Or can you tell me what you think might be wrong ?
