As I was walking near Shands, I noticed a dog without a collar wandering around. It looked like a corgi mix, with mainly black and white coloring. I tried to get it to come closer, but it kept going and went through the woods by the trail that goes behind the Psychology building. This was around the time 11:30 classes got out, so maybe other people saw it too. It’s obviously not my dog, but it might be someone else’s. I’m just spreading the word to keep an eye out and maybe someone can provide an update later.
