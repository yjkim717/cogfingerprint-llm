Do not under any circumstances ever take pictures of yourself/send pictures of yourself if you are under the age of 18 to anyone, even if the recipient is under 18. Do not under any circumstances ask to see pictures from someone under the age of 18, even if you are yourself under the age of 18. Do not send pornographic images (even if it's legal and straight off of the hub) to anyone under the age of 18, even if you are under 18 yourself. If you get caught doing any of those things, you can be arrested for creation and distribution of illicit images of a minor, for sending sexually explicit content to a minor and be put on the sex offender registry. Why am I saying this? Because there was a post on this sub a few hours ago where a minor was telling people how they received a picture from their friend of the same age, very few people mentioned the legal implications this and many users normalised it and joked around. If it was from someone older, there would be uproar. But because it was between 2 minors, there wasn't. Just because it is 2 minors doesn't mean it's legal or any better. It is extremely illegal and you can get into big trouble as I've said above. It's not worth it. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Stay safe people and have a great rest of your Sunday :)
