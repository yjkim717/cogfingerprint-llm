I'm losing my sh*t (not at the baby). I have to give antibiotics to my 7mo for an infection, and I'm supposed to make him drink this horrible, bubble gum flavored, intensely pink (i.e. great for stains) liquid. Of course my baby does everything he can to spit it out - and he's quickly become excellent at it! Half of the medicine is wasted, most of it ends up on clothes and furniture. Infants that young are generally very fussy (ours can't even drink formula if it's not mixed with breast milk), new flavors are tricky. Then why on Earth would anyone think it smart to make it an especially disgusting bubble gum flavor? They don't chew gum at that age!! Seriously, the pet industry has figured out that medicine should be administered smartly - why has the infant industry not figured this out?! This thing is so strongly flavored, I can't even mix it with his milk or food. We've tried different times, when he's calmer etc. but he just spits everything out immediately. He's too young to understand he must take it. The only thing that (somewhat) works now is literally force feeding him and closing his mouth forcefully, but half the time he ends up coughing it out. I feel like I'm torturing the poor little guy, and he's already got enough on his plate with his infection. I'm running out of options. Does anyone have suggestions on how to feed 4ml of disgusting liquid to a baby who refuses to have it?
