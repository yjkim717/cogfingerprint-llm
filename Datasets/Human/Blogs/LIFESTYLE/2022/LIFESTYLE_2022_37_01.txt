Hi guys! Long time MCR fan here, saw them black parade tour and never went back! I love music but I never seem to learn much about the bands I like and the members, I usually just jam out! So until recently really all I knew about the band was the names of the members and what they stand for, but Iâ€™d really like to start watching some interviews. I think i watched life on the murder scene as a teen, and im rewatching now :3 really excellent. What are some of their best interviews? How about some more recent ones? Thanks! Also fun question: whoâ€™s your favorite band member? As a teen I was partial to ray (my friends loved everyone else and I felt he needed some love!) but as an adult I just cannot get over Gerard ðŸ¥µ usually Iâ€™m just a sucker for guitar boys
