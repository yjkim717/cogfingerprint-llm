So now I have a place on the Ohio river close to Louisville. It has a small dock that is on the river. I fished there a few times with Hard baits, Spinners, and topwaters without any luck. I have no idea what to do with the large river and fast moving water. Any suggestion as to what Rig, Bait, and tips for non catfish on the Ohio river? If I decide to go with cut bait or live bait, is 3 way sinker rig the best? I am concern about all the trash and down tree on the river.
