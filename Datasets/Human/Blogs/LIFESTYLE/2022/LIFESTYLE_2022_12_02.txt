I love Willem Dafoe's performances on the big screen, he is a very powerful and commanding actor. I am looking for movies starring him that I have not seen yet. I am hopeful people here have favourites that I haven't seen or heard of before. Movies I have seen: Togo, Aquaman, John Wick, John Carter, Daybreakers, Spiderman 1-3, American Psycho Edit: It's been less than an hour and all of you have already given me numerous titles in multiple genres. Looks like I'm in for quite the ride. Thank you!
