I am a new veggie gardener, and got a bit overzealous late in the season. I have a couple small pepper plants (bell & habanero) that I planted in pots that I’d like to keep going during the winter. I also have two tomatoes plants in pots. We keep it a bit cool in the house, about 70F, sometimes a little cooler. From what I’m reading, the peppers especially need it to be warmer. What’s the best way to accomplish this that is relatively cheap? My pots are big enough, and I’ve got the supports figured out, as well as grow lights. The temperature is the part I’m struggling with. Turning up the heat in the house isn’t an option. Any ideas?
