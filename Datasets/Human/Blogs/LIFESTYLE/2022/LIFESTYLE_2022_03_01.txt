My life has led me to believe the vanlife is for me. I sobered up about 7 months ago from a nasty drug addiction and while I appreciate sobriety there’s some things I miss. Y’all’d probably be offended if I called it homelessness so I’ll call it wandering. I miss wandering. The freedom to live on my own terms. I’ve been a hiker for years but a thru-hike every year isn’t the same as being constantly on the go, though I do intend to keep up my hiking exploits. I have a few questions however which I’ll detail below. **The Rig Itself** -I got about 20 grand to spend all things considered. Looking to get a 2005ish chevy express with around 120k miles on it. Cars.com and craigslist have led me to believe that an in-shape specimen should run me about 5-7k, is that about right? -For stealth reasons I don’t particularly intend on having solar. I intend to work remotely requiring a computer, of which I will use a laptop which is well known for it’s long battery life despite having a comparatively small battery. I also intend to have some kind of ceiling fan/vent. These two items, plus a phone, are the only electronics that require charging that I intend to own. I intend to use battery powered string lights, a cooler instead of a fridge, propane heater, etc. For those electronics that do require charging I intend on using a system which charges directly from my car battery. Most of the time this will only be charging my fan as I can just as easily charge my other devices in a coffeeshop or other similar location. In instances where I’ll be boondocking or otherwise will need to charge devices on the move I expect to be driving hundreds of miles at a clip so presumably the batteries will have more charge for my other electronics. Is this a reasonable approach? Is there anything about this plan that I should know that I haven’t mentioned? -Where do you guys build these things? Right now the plan would be in the gravel parking lot outside of my sober living but the owner may have some misgivings about this. Where you find people willing to let you park a vehicle for months? -I know next to nothing about any of the skills required to build out a van, despite extensive research clueing me into much of what would be required. In sobriety I’ve won a lot of friends who are willing to help, many of whom do have skills. I intend to do the conversion sometime in the spring of 2023 at which time my associates will be wrapping up and I’ll be able to dedicate 40+ hours a week into the conversion. I intend to make the camper as simple as possible (fixed bed, ikea furniture, etc.) How long do you think this will realistically take? I understand this may be a rough question to answer given the relative lack of details but in general is a live-able space possible in 60 days? 90? -My heart’s currently set on a chevy express as I’ve heard good things about their reliability. The obvious other choice is an econoline. Is there any reason I should prefer one or the other? They’re both rated at 250000 miles, so if I buy a 150000 mile specimen and drive 1000 miles a month the van should live for a little over 8 years. Is this in keeping with y’alls experience? -In general do you have tips to keep costs as low as possible? -As I alluded to earlier the plan involves no form of A/C, and only a small propane heater. I can comfortably live in 85* heat and down to 40* (thank hiking for that ability). Is it possible to maintain this range with this setup across the continental united states, avoiding deserts in summer and much of the north in winter? **Lifestyle** Having a history of wandering and long-distance backpacking under my belt this is actually a field I have some solid knowledge about, but have some questions specific to the van. -What’s the legality of passengers in the living space of the van? I can see a couple of instances where several individuals may want to travel with me for short distances. Obviously one passenger up front is legal but what about throughout the rest of the van? -I intend to do remote work. I’m currently in college to be a teacher, and will be certified soon. From what I see of job listings this seems entirely possible, does anyone have experience with this? With the thriftiness I intend to approach van life with I don’t need to be making much, although I do intend to be able to put away 10 racks or so a year so I can comfortably retire (presumably into an RV!) -The big one: I am a trans woman. Over time I have learned what needs to happen to keep me safe. From years of addiction I know what neighborhoods are safe to park in and which aren’t. I ask this question mostly as it relates to showers. If I go into a men’s locker room I risk violence just as much as if I set foot in a woman’s locker room. Any solutions to this? -On the subject of bathrooms, what’s the deal with being able to do regular bathroom things in a gym locker room. Would I be able to put makeup on, shave face and legs, etc.? I’d also like to note I won’t have a sink in the van (too much complexity and cost) -I intend to live in the van to save money for transition (I’ll probably be living in california depending on where I get into for my bachelor’s). Does living in a van in one general area for a time present challenges? -I have a good deal of experience making friends while wandering. Decent friends from trails, people I used to get spun with, etc. I got friends all over the country and if I so desired I could just drive between all of them. I intend to attend AA meetings which will also help. How lonely does vanlife get and how do you mitigate that? That’s it for now, and as the build starts I’m sure I’ll have more questions, but thank you all for your time!
