I know there are a range of options, from just using reading glasses to adjusting individual contact lens strength etc. I just wondered what people have actually tried and what they found worked best. It may be that a combination of solutions is best? Surgery isn't an option for me. EDIT thanks for all the great replies! I'm definitely going to look into the different kinds of multlfocals.
