Your sperm doesn't magically contain your 'benefits', 'superpowers' or 'progress'. Your sperm has ONLY one job: *to deliver genetic information to an egg.* No more, no less. It doesn't give you 'energy'. It doesn't give you 'confidence'. Sperm doesn't help you with any other part of your life any more than your ears help you to smell something. The problem is that after a relapse it *feels* like all the benefits are lost with the ejaculation of sperm, you get that 'drained' feeling for a short time afterwards... but logically that can't be true: If that was true people having sex would suffer as much as fappers... *but they don't!* If that was true then women (who don't have sperm) who do nofap/noporn wouldn't feel great benefits... ***but they do!*** Of course, fapping 10 times a day will result in a nutrient loss (take a daily multivitamin), but the real problem is our *addiction* to the ***behavior of watching porn, fapping and having an orgasm we give ourselves!***. One occasional loss of sperm does not have any negative biological consequence. As men we have evolved to produce sperm regularly without stress. It's literally our main function. On a streak we develop new neurological pathways that help us to be free from compulsive addiction of pornfapping and our desperate need to self-orgasm. THAT is why men *and* women benefit from doing Nofap/noporn... through eliminating their ***addiction!*** What to do? Just keep making streaks. Just like going to the gym, not going to the gym for one day after many days of going to the gym will not eliminate your muscles gains, will it? Nofap is like that, changing our body and mind over time. This isn't about 'sperm worship'. Don't ask 'are my benefits lost?', stop saying "I feel everything is ruined by one fap after my 30-day streak"... just make more streaks and your life will change... ...remember to replace your pornfap habit with NEW, *healthier*, positive activities! THAT is how we can effectively succeed doing nofap
