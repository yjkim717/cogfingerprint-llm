We managed to take a trip to the Galapagos that was amazing last year, during the post-delta "lull". I'm feeling down because I don't know if it's worth planning something more extravagant (we were planning to head to Egypt) or if we should do something domestically. With car rentals being so tough, I feel like I'd prefer to drive somewhere, but am located in the midwestern US and would want to travel to places near the coasts or, at least, go "out west". We've explored quite a bit of the eastern seaboard. How have you been coping? What do you look for in unlikely destinations closer to home, if you've chosen that path? We're into just about any kind of outdoor activities, so suggestions are also welcome, especially if you're in on some best kept secrets on midwestern travel locations with great hiking, biking, or kayaking! \*\*EDIT: I obviously mean 2022.
