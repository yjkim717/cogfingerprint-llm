I just got AT&T Fiber and they gave me the BGW320-505 Modem/Router. I have an AC1750 Router already. How are the speed differences between the two? Anything I would notice? I can't find much online about the BGW320-505. I'm thinking I might just stick with the BGW320-505 and put my AC1750 out in the garage as an access point.
