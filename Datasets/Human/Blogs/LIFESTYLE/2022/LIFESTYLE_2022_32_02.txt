I usually hit around 300k-700K on my expo teams (and maybe 1mil on level 2 light expo if all the debuffs hit right) &#x200B; **Pherus (Fire)**: Krau, Luna, Clorina, Amomo **Symaqus (Ice)**: Fkluri, Cidd, Roana, ALots (This one sucks for some reason lol. I think my speed tuning is off) **Lich (Earth)**: Aras, Tamarinne, Kayron, Bellona (looking to replace with Tenebria) **Gigantus (Dark)**: Fkluri, Landy, Luluca, Tamarinne **Moroi (Light)**: Aras, Cerise, Kise, Landy (hits really hard at lvl 2, but struggles with level 3) &#x200B; I'm trying to hit 1mil+ on auto as consistently as possible so I can get those whale emotes and help my noob friends out rasLaugh. Any high hitters care sharing their expo teams so I can try to improve on mine? lol
