Is it worth it to use an nvMe SSD as a cache for a SATA SSD. Something like Intel RapidStorage or bcache? Most of my personal files are on a SATA SSD but those files are small-ish. My other use case is editing large videos from an external drive but I could just copy them over to my nVMe. Does it make sense to do it? What about a RAM cache? (tmpfs ?)
