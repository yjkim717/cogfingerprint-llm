Hello Bellevue, I found a room I like on Craigslist, I met up with the owner, he showed me around the house, I met the other roommates (there were 2 other guys living there and they seemed to be perfectly normal, respectable people) and I like the room and I'm ready to make a deposit. However, even though the man says he owns the property and the roommates seem to treat him as a property owner. I trust he is the property owner, but is there any way to 100% confirm he is the property owner of that given address of that house with some sort of public record or something? The guy just kind of SAYS he's the owner of the house y'know? What if he's not? I'm just trying to avoid getting scammed before I send him my deposit because I actually really like the room. I do THINK he's the property owner, but I want like 100% confidence that, that is indeed his property and not someone else's. Anyone know how to confirm that an owner actually does indeed own said property? I have his full name, phone number and address and that's really about it. I'm just doing this for my own safety and so I don't completely lose my deposit to someone who doesn't actually own the home. Any replies would be helpful thanks!
