Main rings: 18 SWG 5/32” (AR 3.5) Central ring: 18 SWG 9/32” (I think. I’ll check in the morning) This week I’ve been making chainmail gifts for my friends. I decided to learn the Byzee Beez weave for a bracelet but with 3.5 AR rings (currently limited on supplies). It was far too tight for the normal weave so I did some modifications. I also ditched the bracelet idea. What I ended up with after some trial and error was… this… monstrosity. It looks like those stars you quickly drew as a kid. A suboptimal Patrick Star. I mean, it works, but it looks childish. Truthfully, I’m not sure if this unit has anything going for it. The connections between the Byzee Beez are extremely difficult when you get to the last two internal connections. The rings overlap in unsightly ways and I can’t be bothered to give it another shot to find the ideal AR and wire diameters to make it actually look pretty. Against my mind’s best wishes, I’m planning to embellish the unit so it looks a bit nicer as a gift. Any suggestions or should I scrap it?
