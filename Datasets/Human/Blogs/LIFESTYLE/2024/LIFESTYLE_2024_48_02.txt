I have a close relative who does not want their timeshare anymore and willing to give it to us for free. I know to not get ever buy timeshares, even though I have been to quite a few, for the points and free nights. I wanted to know if it makes sense to get it for free, and what, if any, questions I should be asking before I commit to this decision. Thank you!
