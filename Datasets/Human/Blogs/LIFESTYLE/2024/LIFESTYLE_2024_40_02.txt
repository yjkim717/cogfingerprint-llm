There are plenty of guys here who are nervous about sex, whether they've had it or not, and this post is for you, so you can understand, relax, and feel confident as you go forward in life. Unlike older guys like me you younger guys, even though some of you are virgins, have seen more sex through online pornography than anyone else in human history... and you've been taught by that, whether you know it or not... you've been taught to think that crazy and extreme sex is normal. You've been mis-taught to think you *must* be aroused on a daily basis. All emotional understanding of what sex is or what actually happens in and around sex is absent from what pornography falsely teaches you. The problems this creates in guys should not be underestimated. **Sex is not a performance.** Everything porn taught you is wrong. If I thought that sex MUST be 30 minutes of Olympic acrobatic fuck-pounding or the girl will be disappointed I'd be scared my first time too! I'd be scared *every* time! But thankfully that's all BULLSHIT. Porn has built this up to be something it isnt. IT ISN'T A PERFORMANCE, THE GIRL DOESNT CARE ABOUT THAT. SHE LIKES...**YOU**, understand? She will not stop liking YOU if your penis isn't porn-star big, or if you don't last 30 minutes... *but slow down there buddy, we're not even there yet!* Enjoy her company! Ever heard of kissing? If it feels like that's the mood (believe me she will let you know if she wants to be kissed... by being close, looking in your eyes, making you feel listened to and appreciated) then enjoy that... and maybe more, and more... and cuddles! AND ... talking! And laughter... Porn never has the conversations in it, does it? or the cuddles... or the AFTER... DUDE, a girl just wants to feel liked as a person THE SAME AS YOU! Relax about all the dick stuff, STOP MEASURING YOUR ERECTIONS, relax if you last 10 seconds, make sure you communicate, physically or otherwise, that you care about her as a person, a sexy person, and that's all that matters. Appreciate that she's there *spending time with* ***you***. So relax. You can only overthink this. We shall go now to your worst fear so you can relax::::: Unlike what porn trains you to think, if you cum in 10 seconds that's totally ok and funny and it shows her you like her and find her attractive... laugh, it IS funny (because you're not being graded on your sex performance)... and then cuddle and maybe in 20 minutes or so, with each other's help... YOU CAN GO AGAIN AND LAST LONGER! There is no failure here unless you think there should be, but there isn't. **...or maybe you'll be so nervous you can't get it up at all! That's slightly less funny, but very understandable for someone suffering under the *invented burden* of 'performance anxiety'.. Just be honest with her if this happens. Don't try and 'perform' for anybody :)** EVERYTHING PORN TEACHES YOU ABOUT SEX, REALITY, RELATIONSHIPS, WOMEN, 'MANLINESS', YOUR OWN BODY...IS WRONG. CONTEMPLATE THAT AND LET IT GO ---------- another way of knowing you don't need to worry about how to be 'successful' during sex... is HUMANS HAVE BEEN HAVING SUCCESSFUL, PLEASURABLE SEX FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS WITHOUT ANY 'PLANNING' OR 'RESEARCH' AT ALL. You don't need to think about 'how to do sex'... *all you need to do is be appreciative of the person you're with and be playful.* When you were a child and playing ball with a friend... did you need to 'research' how to do that? **No. You just had fun and were creative with whatever happens.** Sex is exactly like that: playful, fun and without judgement
