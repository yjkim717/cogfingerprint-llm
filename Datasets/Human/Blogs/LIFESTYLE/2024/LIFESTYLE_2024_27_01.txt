Recently got rejected after submitting a take home assignment for lacking “depth”. I work in India and have an MBA which means I’m surrounded by engineers who are typically more comfortable with numbers and quant thinking. My submission was more qualitative-heavy and I feel that is the reason for my rejection. Any tips on how to nail these take home assignments?
