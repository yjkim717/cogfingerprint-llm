I currently work in the telecommunications industry as a data technician. Working in the field with pulling cable, terminations, and setting up data racks. I currently make the same as a journeyman electrician because I am a member of the IBEW 213 union. That being said I am becoming increasingly bored with my current career. And I would be stuck staying not only in BC, but in the lower mainland, which is very expensive to live, to continue getting the same rate of pay as it is not a recognized or Red Seal trade if I move to another location. I have been a recreational diver for a number of years now and I have always enjoyed new experiences. I have my advanced open water and enriched air diver (nitrox) certifications. I live near Vancouver BC and I am currently looking into signing up for the Commercial Scuba Diver course. I might be willing to travel for it if the difference of education quality was great enough as well. Which school would be the best option for me to get my foot into the industry? Maybe even off to a running start? I'm not exactly interested in the offshore/underwater welding side of things. But when it comes to aquaculture diving, seafood harvesting, police operations, search and recovery, basically everything that the commercial diving course qualifies you for, I am game for. I am 35 years old if that makes a difference for some reason. I would like to not have to sit around after graduating and hopefully find a company that provides work all year round and is not seasonal. Any recommendations and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
