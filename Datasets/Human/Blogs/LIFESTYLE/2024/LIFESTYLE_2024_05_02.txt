I bought this P. saundersii back in like 2019. The top had already been chopped and the two fat branches were just nubs. I’ve basically ignored it for 5 years, but I’ve been on both a caudex and a bonsai kick lately and discovered some cool saundersii specimens that I’d like to try to recreate. I’m thinking of cutting all those branches pretty low to promote more branching and hopefully more caudex development. Any other tips to achieve that look?
