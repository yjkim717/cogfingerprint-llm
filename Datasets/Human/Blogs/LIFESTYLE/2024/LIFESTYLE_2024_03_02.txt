I’m planning on doing an AT thru starting in May. People seemed to think a waterproof bivy is a bad idea and after some thinking I tend to agree. I usually do a tarp and bug bivy but I think a little extra weight for more sanity on a trail known for its storms is wise. I’m stuck between the Protrail and the Preamble. After talking to their customer service I see it like this. Preamble has more space and is lighter (by about 4 ounces). Seemingly better condensation management due to better airflow and also looks cooler (this doesn’t matter), but has no floor. Protrail is smaller, weighs more, and has worse condensation, but it does have a floor. I currently don’t have the money for DCF and don’t intend on spending more than $300. The X-mid weighs a bit to much for my liking, I’d like for the setup without stakes and cord to be sub 25 oz. I’m 5’11 and 140 lbs and very used to small spaces. Just looking for the ability to sit up. I might also take people out every now and then so the 2p nature of the preamble is appealing. But ticks are a great way to fail a thru. Unsure, leaning atm towards the protrail. Thoughts? Any other product that does all of the above I’m not thinking about? My bw without shelter is around 5.5 lbs. Thanks.
