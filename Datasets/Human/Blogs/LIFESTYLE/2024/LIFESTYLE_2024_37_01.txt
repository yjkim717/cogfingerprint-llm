I’m looking to make these mitts from Fox and folk. Having a hard time finding a yarn I’d like. I want to use baby alpaca like the pattern suggests, but I haven’t used alpaca in a while so I don’t have any go-tos. The pattern used Plymouth baby alpaca DK, but I can’t seem to find that anywhere. One of the projects was using King Cole baby alpaca which I liked the look of knit up, but doesn’t have a lot of color options. Leaning towards dark gray, DK weight baby alpaca. Any suggestions? Please and thank you!
