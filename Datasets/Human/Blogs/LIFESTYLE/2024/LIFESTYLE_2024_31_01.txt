Hi all, I think I've asked this before but I'm asking again. I need a spice mix that is flavorful but not spicy. When I asked the store owner, he said Shan was the best one and I'm like with that. However I tried a couple varieties of those, and not only are they spicy, they don't taste anything like the ones I get at the Indian food place. These places aren't high end so I assume when when I get these things they use generic mixes. But I get overwhelmed looking at all the brands the store has and the shop owners recommendation was not on spot. I understand I can make my own but easier to experiment with the $2 box mix then with $30 worth of spices but to not work out. Any guidance is appreciated
