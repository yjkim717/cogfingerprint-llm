Can anyone offer advice as to how I can snap out of my brain fog and exhaustion? It affects my productivity and motivation and leads me to make regrettable mistakes at work. I get enough sleep at night, I don't drink or do drugs, eat generally heathly, and I exercise. I feel like I do all of the right things but I can't break out of it. I feel foggy and tired most days to the point where I can't focus on the tasks that I need to do. I drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning and I try not to overdo the caffeine. Can anyone offer any suggestions? I'll try literally anything. Note: I do have a thyroid condition which is managed by medication. When I've asked my doctor about how I feel she says that there is nothing else to do since my levels are balanced. I've seen multiple doctors and they all say basically the same thing.
