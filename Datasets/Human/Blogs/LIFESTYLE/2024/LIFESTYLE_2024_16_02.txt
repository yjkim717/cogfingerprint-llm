Imperator:Rome is a grand strategy developed by Paradox that was released in 2019 in an awful state, the community hated it for various reasons (mostly the mana systems and lack of content outside of Rome). Until 2021, the game continued to receive updates and DLCs, culminating in patch 2.0, which transformed the game into something completely different from its initial launch. But the damage was done, and the player base was so low that Paradox decided to move on and stopped bringing resources to the game (although it still received some minor maintenance patches). But still, it retained some community, and a group of people developed the Invictus mod, a mod that can basically be called Imperator+. It currently has over 90k subscribers. The mod provides overhauls to the game and also adds a plethora of content to many nations, making the game incredibly fun to play beyond the main characters. This mod, along with the latest patch, makes Imperator a quite good game, and the community believes it deserves a second chance. That's why, in celebration of the Ides of March, the community has scheduled Imperator Day: a community effort to boost concurrent player numbers as high as possible The celebration has been going well so far, and yesterday we had the highest player peak since 2021. We even received some kind of response from Paradox itself. Anyways, I just wanted to post this to let people know that it's happening. Imperator is in a really good place right now, so if you like strategy games, consider giving it a try. It's also currently in sale! Hope everyone has a good Imperator Day!
