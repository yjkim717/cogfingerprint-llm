This is an idea that has been growing on us, based on the following Venn diagram: 1/ there is an increasing trend towards homeschooling at the moment, with plenty of resources and success stories showing it is possible. 2/ We love travel. FIRE'ing at a fairly young age to simply be stuck at home doesn't necessarily appeal to me (I might as well work if I'm going to be stuck in the same place 10 months a year). Travel connected homeschooling is an experience we are reading a lot of positive things about. 3/ Staying in our VHCOL is kind of a catch 22 here - we don't really see ourselves living somewhere else if we stayed in the US, but it's very expensive and it means if we stayed in the US, we'd have to push for FatFire levels. Leaving to travel the world more is more exciting to us, maybe with a base somewhere more affordable a few months a year (note: we have dual EU/US passports) and occasionally visiting friends in VHCOL areas. All in all, we are wondering if we wouldn't enjoy our "retired" lives more as a semi nomadic family, focused on raising our kid and schooling him. Curious if there are other FIRE'd people who have used their time to homeschool their kid (internationally or not) and what pros and cons they could share.
