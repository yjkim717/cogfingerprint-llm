Doing a week rental and a little confused by the verbiage of the town parking page. $30 maximum in 24 hours - Is parking for a full week allowed and does this mean it will be a max of $30 or $30 per day? Aware of street parking down commercial but collecting this info for my parents who are already freaking out at not being able to pre plan and control every variable.
