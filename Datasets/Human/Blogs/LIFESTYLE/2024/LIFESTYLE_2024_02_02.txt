My company current uses a mix of PowerBI and Tableau for our dashboarding products. We intend to move from a tool based distribution to our customers to a more SaaS integration (which will likely mean stopping Tableau as their licensing is messy). Yellowfin has popped up as a potential option that seems to offer very customer friendly visualisations/UI as well as good white labelling options to fully integrate those visualisations in our system. Our team (comprised on BI designers and database engineers) is starting a discovery phase to better understand the pros and cons, but everyone has more experience with PowerBi or Tableau, and I am curious about a few things: 1/ From your experience, how hard is transferring to Yellowfin - more particularly from a PowerBI system, where most of our content is currently accessed? 2/ From a skillset perspective, we're currently hiring a new BI engineer. The market we're hiring in does not seem big on Yellowfin, so we'll likely have to learn it. How transferrable would you say the skillsets are if someone comes with a lot of PowerBI experience? Curious if anyone here has played with the platform and could provide a perspective.
