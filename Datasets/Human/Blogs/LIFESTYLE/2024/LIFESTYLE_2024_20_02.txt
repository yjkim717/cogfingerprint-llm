I lost a slideshow that I spent 6 hours on last night. I'm trying to recreate it now and it's not saving. Trying to do something similar in Google Slides is a waste of time. I'm so upset and of course there is no customer support. I am pressing save after every slide, and checking the status in a separate browser. My internet connection is fine. I can't think of anything else I can control. Any suggestions? Thanks!
