I never really used mint but when they shut it down Reddit started showing me posts from this sub and it inspired me to start using one of the recommended tools. After some research i chose monarch money and holy crap it’s awesome, I’m wondering what more people could want in a tool like this it’s fantastic. Just an FYI for those looking for a replacement i can’t imagine it doesn’t do whatever it is you need. 30 day free trial and half off first year.
