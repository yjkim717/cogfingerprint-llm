I recently saw a post in r/scams where someone had their credit card stolen and laptops ordered to their house, where the person who stole the card was waiting outside to take the package. I know states probably have their own laws about this, but would the person who took the laptops be charged with theft of that laptops since they technically ordered it, or just charged for the stolen cards?
