Hey all! I keep getting these ads for the Bluffworks Petaluma Pant. I really love the style but they never have the petite version in stock. I'd love to find something similar that I can wear when I'm traveling for work. They look professional but comfortable and they look like you can dress them up or down, which I love. Can anyone recommend something that they have found that is similar and offers petite sizes? Link to the pants below.
