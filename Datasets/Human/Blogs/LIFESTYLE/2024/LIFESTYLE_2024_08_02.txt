Hello! I work in a landscaping company as a sales director. I struggle with dressing for work in a style that suits me. Some days I am mostly in meetings, sometimes I meet with wealthy clients, sometimes I meet crews on job sites. I kind of always have to look like I am ready for a home through the back 40 or like I could pick up a shovel and do some gardening. But I also have to look professional and put together. And, as a sometimes designer I like a little creative edge. As an SD, these kinds of clothes look frumpy on me. Jeans are ok but tops with odd neckline or silky fabrics are out of place. To add to my dressing troubles I am overweight and what might work on a trimmer body just don't feel good on me, and I spend most of my day with a constant internal murmur about looking bad. Argh. Any suggestions for clothing styles or brands I could look for?
