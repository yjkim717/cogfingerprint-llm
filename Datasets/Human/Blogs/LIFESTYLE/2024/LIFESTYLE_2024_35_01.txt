So I'm kinda new to the online game, but not new to MLB the show. For the past few years, I mainly played offline mode. I want to get into online this year. Here are my questions: For the Event, if you are not good at online games, should I stay away from it? If I'm not that good, should I go play BR? What is the main goal for playing BR if I cannot win multi games? I know I get to earn those cards for the set collection but since those silver and low gold cards are not that $$$$, would it be better to flip cards and buy them for the collection? Is it correct for me to focus on the Rank game for online play? &#x200B; &#x200B;
