Is this it? I'm close to graduate as a Computer Engineer, with some specialization in Data Science. I've always wanted to kinda make an impact on the world, or at least do something interesting as a job. But now that I'm looking for internships and jobs, it seems that 90% of the market is just web/app developement, things that I could have learnt to do just doing sideprojects or just some 1 or 2 years courses. Why did I spent all this money and years on a a univesity degree? Of course I've learnt a lot, but why does it matters that I've learnt about big O notation and to try to optimise algorithms when I'm not be using any of that and just forget about it in 2 years? Of course there's some data science or complex engineering jobs out there, but It seems that most of them required a gazilion of job experience in multiple frameworks that I haven't seen in Uni. Literally all I'm applying which I feel I have chances of getting interviewed is just php, java or .net web dev in local companies. And I even feel inadequate for them because I just studied some basic web dev in uni, so wtf I'm supposed to do? sorry for the rant, I'm just feeling incredibly sad about my future rn
