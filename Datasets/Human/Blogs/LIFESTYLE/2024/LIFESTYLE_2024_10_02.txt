Hello, fellow Sobernauts! Welcome to 'Tude Talk Tuesday, where you're invited to share what changes you've noticed in your attitudes and perspectives since you've gotten sober. I once heard someone say "I'm just terrified of what comes with my drinking" and that resonated with me. Towards the end of my drinking, I was scared. A lot. I was drinking without any ability to control it. I was hiding it from everyone around me. I knew I had to stop, but I couldn't imagine life without alcohol. In sobriety, as time has gone on, I have fewer fears. That said, I still have what I consider to be a healthy fear of what would ever happen if I started drinking again. I'd go right back to the same, frightening existence I was living right before I got sober. I'd risk losing my wife, my kids, my life. I know all these things would happen because my drinking brought me there and I have no doubt it would bring me there again. I don't spend my time dwelling on these fears or worry about drinking. But when I feel a craving, or a whimsical thought about having a beer or something, I let a little of that fear loose, just to scare some sense into me. So, how about you? How do you feel about your drinking?
