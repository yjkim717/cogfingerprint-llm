Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi is a historical novel that follows the lives of two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, born in 18th century Ghana and their descendants over eight generations: The sisters take different paths, with Effia marrying a wealthy Englishman and living in Cape Coast Castle, while Esi is captured and sold into slavery to an American planter. The novel's narrative arc is shaped by the contrasting lives of their descendants, who experience different parts of the world, including Ghana, the American Civil War, Jazz Age Harlem, and the civil rights era. The book explores themes of power and privilege, memory and legacy, and how slavery and racism have left a lasting impact on history and individuals. I absolutely adore this book. Iâ€™m still having reading hangover and still yet to move on to another book because of how well-written the story was. The beginning, middle, and end of the book was amazing. Highly recommend!
