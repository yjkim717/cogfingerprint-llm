I haven't used my CPAP for ages and I really need to get back into it as my sleep has been very disruptive due to my apnea. My current mask is the Resmed AirFit N30i which has been my favourite up until now because of the tube placement. Although that's not 100% required for me next mask. I have tried other nasal masks as well. Unfortunately I am either a mouth breather or the CPAP pushes air out of my mouth because my mouth falls open so I require chin strap which doesn't always seem to solve the problem. Would a full face mask be a better option for me? Is that even possible with my beard as it is? I would really prefer not to have to shave if possible as I cannot stand how I look without one. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
