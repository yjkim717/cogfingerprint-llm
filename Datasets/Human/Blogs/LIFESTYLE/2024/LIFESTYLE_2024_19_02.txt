I'm putting down LVP in a small 5'x5' bathroom (I know LVP isn't a pros first choice in a bathroom... but it's economical and should be easy enough for me to DIY). One board is 6' long. Therefore, I could technically get away without staggering at all. Should I still stagger though to make it "more" visually appealing?
