I hate tailgaters in general and I find them to be annoying, aggressive assholes but it’s especially annoying when I’m not even the one slowing them down. What do they hope to accomplish by tailgating me?! There’s no where I can go, and even if I did get out of their way they still can’t go any faster. Are these people just so stupid that they don’t realize that ? It’s so fucking annoying. I’ve never felt the need to tailgate any vehicle on the road, but doing it in this situation is even more stupid. I’ve heard people claim it’s because I’m not tailgating the car in front of me, yeah OFC I’m not because I want to keep a safe distance and I’m not an aggressive asshat.
