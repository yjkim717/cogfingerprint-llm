I’m so tired and fed up of feeling like I’m an idiot. I have been at a new role for the last 5 months and had a long chat with my manager about mistakes I’ve been making in my data. After this chat, I vowed to never make stupid mistakes again. Well guess what - I made yet another stupid mistake. After the chat. After I spent extra time looking at my sheets for errors. The only explanation is that I’m dumb right? There’s literally no other way I can continue to still make mistakes even when I spend hours and hours checking everything.
