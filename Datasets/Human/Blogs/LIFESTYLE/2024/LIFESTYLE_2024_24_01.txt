The point of this question isn't supposed to be literally "what's better, big city or small town?" I was watching a video on youtube by Jimmy the Giant about the decline in english seaside towns and in it he reads a quote saying the number of londoners leaving the capital dropped significantly in 2023 and implies that the glut of people looking to move out to the countryside after covid has been reversed as people rediscover "the joys of city life". I think its fair to say there are pros and cons of big cities, smaller towns and rural villages. Ill be honest though, if its true people are flocking back to london, that surprises me a bit. I'd started to think medium sized/large towns could offer something perfect in a post-covid world and had hoped it might result in some regeneration. Where do you choose to live and why? Where would you actually like to live and why?
