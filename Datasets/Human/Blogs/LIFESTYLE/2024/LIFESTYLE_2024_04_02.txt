This plant suffered a fall after a cat incident a few months back. It lost some leaves that balanced it more and I did my best to repot it. I had it on a table in a corner where it had support from the wall, but not enough light. I moved it to a window and it quickly got sunburned, so I moved it to it's original location, but without support, I am not sure it will ever grow upwards again. This pot is only about 2/3 dirt, allowing it to lean a bit, but the roots are so shallow that it doesn't have the strength to stand, but it's not enough dirt for a stake, either. Any suggestions? I water most plants once a week, but the changes in light have also impacted the soil's water retention and so I have been leaning toward under watering. While this pot does not have drainage, there is a bed of rock below a nursery pot that this aloe lives in.
