Ciao a tutti! I'm visiting Italy next week- hitting multiple cities and I wish to buy at least one mid-range leather bag (my budget is $500). I'm visiting Verona, Vicenza, Trento, Milan, and Venice in the north, as well as Palermo and Catania. I'm hoping that smaller cities like Vicenza have more affordable shopping, but I don't know. I'm also specifically looking for beaded clutch suggestions, if anyone has them. Please let me know if you have any ideas. Grazie!
