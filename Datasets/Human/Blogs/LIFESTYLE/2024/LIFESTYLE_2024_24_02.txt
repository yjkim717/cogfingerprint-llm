Saw this scam ad appear before a video I was watching, it claims to be the owner of solana (cryptocurrency) and says to thank supporters you can scan a qr code on screen to be entered into a giveaway. It's pretty obvious looking at his mouth it's AI. Pretty bad that it's got past youtube. I worry for when AI gets better in the near future.
