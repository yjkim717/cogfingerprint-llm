I'm on day 17. First 3 days some URI symptoms and minor fever, cleared pretty quickly. (i did not take paxlovid) Since it cleared then I've had nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness, have had those symptoms now for 2 weeks. Today all of a sudden I feel sick, some shivering, minor fever (99.3F), run down, like classic sick feeling. Wtf, is this a rebound? Or my body finally fucking this virus off? But, at this point, if this is a rebound, should I consider taking paxlovid? Anyone have experience with that? Any advice? I did just do a home test and it come back negative, but i haven't really left the house since.
