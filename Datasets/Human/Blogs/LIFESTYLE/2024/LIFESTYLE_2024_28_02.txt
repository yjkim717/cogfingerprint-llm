I imagine that if we detect synchronous laser light coming from a distant star system this is a telltale of life with advanced technology. Perhaps there are other telltales besides modulated radiation. Does the LHC emit any radiation or particles that carry far and that would clearly not be coming from a natural source to alien observers?
