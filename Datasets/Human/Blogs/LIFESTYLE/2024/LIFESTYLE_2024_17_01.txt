Hi all, I currently just gave Virgin my 30 days (yesterday) notice and they had reached me today offering £29 for 500 to retain me. I have looked on comparasion websites and seen they are able to beat out some of the market but I have also called up a few companies (Sky, BT, Plusnet and EE) who have allowed me to get 350 for £25 (with my phone contract ending soon they are only going to charge tenner a month for their sim). I am pretty sure Virgin can do a lot more to entice me which is why I am decling their said offer for now. But does anyone have any tips on getting the best price for the best deal.
