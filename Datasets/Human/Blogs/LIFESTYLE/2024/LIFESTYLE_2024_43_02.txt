Has anyone tried to use ChatGPT or something else to create GA4 reports? GA4 has 169 metrics and 343 dimensions and even after discounting for same dimension names with many scopes (event, user), I still can't remember all of them. So, I've been experimenting with large language models (LLMs) like GPTs to at least suggest relevant dimensions and metrics from natural language description but all of them hallucinate dimensions and metrics too much to be useful. I tried uploading a file containing all dimensions and metric names but ChatGPT 4 in particular ran out of context, so it didn't work out. Recently, I tried it with Google's Gemini 1.5 which has a huge context window of 1 million tokens, and it seems to work reliably well. It is not as intelligent as ChatGPT 4 but it's really good at recalling specific pieces of information from its context, so it works well for this use case. Right now, it gives step by step instructions to create reports without hallucinating dimension and column names. In fact, I also tried it to write small Python scripts to pull data from Ga4 and visualize it using GA4's API, all from just a natural language description of report and it works even better because we can directly embed the Protobuf schema of GA4 API in its context! I am sharing the files I upload to Gemini and my system prompt in case someone finds this interesting/useful in a comment below.
