I’m an international tourist and so many people recommended me to book my stay at the Blackwoods campgrounds. Without much thinking I’ve booked a weekend stay for $30 at one of the campgrounds camp site. How am I supposed to arrange a tent and what other things will I have to bring with me? I’m planning to come to the park using a rental car starting from Massachusetts.
