I have a 8 hour layover at LAX and need to drive to Yorba Linda and back to LAX. I should be there on Tuesday (Christmas eve in the morning) and hoping traffic won't be that bad. Having never been to LAX how much time does it take to get to the car rental facility versus trying to get a Turo? Which one would you do, given all these time constraints? Thanks! UPDATE: Hey thank you everyone for commenting, but I wanted to update here in case anyone needs this is the future. I ended up doing Avis, which was really fast and efficient.
