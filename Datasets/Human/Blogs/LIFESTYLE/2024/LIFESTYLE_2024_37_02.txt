I'm not sure what's going on with my game. I think im towards the end of disc three. I'm trying to follow the chain of letters to complete the mognet quest. I'm not trying to deliver all letters, just the ones for mognet central. Kupo doesn't say anything to me, and I have no letters. It's possible that I got the first letter in the chain from him earlier in the game, but then I should have something to deliver. The guides say you can do this all in disc four, so I don't see how I could have messed it up earlier on by missing something.
