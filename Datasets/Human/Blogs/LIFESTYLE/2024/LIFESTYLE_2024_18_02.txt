As the title says. I'm looking for a drama that deals with first contact or some other paranormal entities. I love how it keeps switching from government entity to government entity/news media outlets. Maybe a modern version of the War of the Worlds broadcast would be a better comparison. Abiet a much darker version. I love stories featuring SETI or other organizations using radio astronomy.
