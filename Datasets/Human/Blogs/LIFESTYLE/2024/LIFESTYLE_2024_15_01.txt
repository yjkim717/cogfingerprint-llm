My mum wants me to install a tracking app onto my phone so herself, my sister, and I can track each other basically. She claims it's for our safety and that if something happens to one of us then we'll be able to use it to find where we are. But I don't want that. I'm 19(M) and I've told her I have a right to privacy, and that I don't want to download the app, because I don't see why my family should know my location 24/7. And it's not like I'm not honest with her, either. I tell her exactly where I'm going, when I plan on getting back, I'll message if I'm running late or if there's a change in plans. I tell her if I'm getting drunk/high with people and tell her who I'm with. It's not like I'm trying to hide something, which she's now accusing me of because I don't want the tracking app on my phone. I've tried explaining to her that I'm also an adult too. I have a full time job, I pay for everything I use myself and I pay her housekeeping. And whilst she accepts that, she's completely ignoring it in the grand scheme of things. She sees me not installing the app as me not caring about her, as I clearly don't want to put her mind at ease and I don't care about her safety. I've told her that I'll even compromise and install the app so if she wants to, she can willingly be tracked for her safety, but that my location would be off. That's not good enough for her. So, AITA for refusing to install a tracking app onto my phone?
