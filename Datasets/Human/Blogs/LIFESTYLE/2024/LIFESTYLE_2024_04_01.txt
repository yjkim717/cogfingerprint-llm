It's in a rural area, so I have only found a couple appraisers in the area, and I'm a bit worried that I don't really know how much it should cost, what questions I should be asking, or what information they should provide me before I ask them to move forward. Part of me thinks this should be a commodity and everyone's price should be similar. Is it? What is a "good" versus "bad" appraisal? We're really just looking to find out how much the property is worth before selling.
