Hello Bankaifolk users! I am pleased to announce that we have added two new moderators to our team: u/Overall-Yard308 and u/Ambitious_Job_2126! Both of these members are well active in the community and will help moderate bankaifolk while continuing to ensure it stays the great community it is. I also wanted to take the time to talk about hornyposting. A lot of users have complained that this subreddit has too much hornyposting, and it should be banned altogether like r/bleach. My answer to that is pointing to official art of Orihime by Tite Kubo himself: This is official art. Art from an author inspires their fans to do similar works. So if this community makes a bunch of fanart that mimics Kubo’s style, then the mod team here is all for that. That’s just how fandoms work. What is not ok, is full-fledged hentai or porn, aka full nudity or sexual intercourse. And this doesn’t have to be said, but will be said anyway, no illicit photos of characters that, for all intents and purposes, are children. But we do want to promote discussion, powerscaling, theories, etc. So we ask the community to take a look at the frontpage before making a hornypost. If there’s 4 other posts like yours, maybe wait until they go down before spamming the front page with hornyposts. Us mods are also willing to lock comments/posts for hornyposts to prevent spam. Let us know your feedback in the comments below Thanks!
