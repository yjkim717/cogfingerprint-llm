I'm trying to help my sister out with this. Husband is incarcerated for a LONG time. She has two kids with him and is still legally married. The income limit looks absurdly low, but also why is it even applicable? I can't find anything online. I am going to set up a VERA call with her and I (I've been navigating the VA for myself, this is her first rodeo) but I'm not even sure where to start for information. Can anyone give me some guidance please?
