Looking at 5th wheels mostly and some TT’s. I want to be in the sub 33’ range (usually a “29”) 5th wheel. I like the idea of a separate bunk room for the kids such as on a rainy day they have their own space and TV. On the flip side they are harder to find than regular bunks. Has anyone owned both types. Any pros and cons between them? Kids age 9 and 6. Kid friends will also probably tag along.
