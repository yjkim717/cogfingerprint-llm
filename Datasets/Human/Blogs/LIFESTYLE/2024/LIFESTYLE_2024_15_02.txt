Hi, Despite the recent dip in form, I've last minute decided to go and watch the lads play in Sheffield on Saturday. I'm a season ticket holder and only go to the home games, and the away games I've been too were bought by others. So I've gone onto the website, bought my ticket and just my luck - it crashed during the transaction. My bank has charged the money and when I click my eticketing profile, it's saying that my next game is on Saturday. However, I've had no email confirmation come through nor a reference number for my order. Are you meant to get an email and order reference when buying away tickets or has something gone wrong my end, or am I just overthinking? Thanks for everyone's help in advance, and sorry if this type of post isn't allowed on here. COME ON YOU HATTERS!
