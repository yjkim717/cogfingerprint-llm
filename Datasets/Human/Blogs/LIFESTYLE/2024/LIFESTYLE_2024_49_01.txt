I’ve been reflecting on the friendships portrayed in shows like Friends, How I Met Your Mother, and The Big Bang Theory. These shows depict friendships that endure through all kinds of ups and downs over the years. No matter what happens, the friendship seems to always prevail. It might sound odd, but I’ve even learned a lot about apologizing and mending relationships from watching these shows. However, a part of me can’t help but think that these kinds of friendships are somewhat artificial, and that real life doesn’t quite work that way. But then, I remember my Erasmus days in France. During that time, I was part of a group that truly felt like we were living the kind of life you see in these shows. We were far from home, navigating a new environment together, and we bonded deeply—sometimes just by sitting in a dorm room talking for hours. So, here’s what I’m wondering: Are the friendships depicted in these shows realistic, or is it just a fantasy? I have people around me who I call friends, but we’re all so busy with our own lives and problems. It seems like meeting up a few times a month, sending the occasional message, and liking each other’s social media posts has become the standard for what counts as a good friendship. But when I see these shows, I feel like we’re missing the essence of what friendship should be—spending time together, hanging out almost every day, eating together, and just being there for each other. Do any of you have a life like the ones in these shows? Or would you even want one? Am I just overthinking things and forgetting that we live in a different world?
