Some background bought NJ condo in 2016 when the overwhelming message was buy a home by mid 30s or youâ€™ve failed at life, years later I have some regrets. There have been too many assessments for a barely 20 year old building. My maintenance fees have tripled since buying. The city education system is a basket case and will certainly need to plug the gaps with a property tax increase whenever NJ pulls the Abbott funding. Assuming capital gains + closing costs I can still make at least $130K - $150K profit through a sale. The Biden announcement on up to $10K for selling a first time home makes this even more appealing. Edit - Current interest rate is 3.875%. I already have 20K in my company 401K and another 55K in a Roth IRA from prior employment. Turning 40 this year and retirement will probably be at whatever the no reduction age is by then. I know the frequent mantra is better to own than rent but is that always the case or am I better off renting for the rest of my life and sticking that $130K - $150K into index fund?
