Hi, Iâ€™ve been doing tarot reading for the past 4 years. I would like to practice more on the yes/no part as I just bought a book that can actually tells the difference between yes or no answers through the cards. Any questions are welcome, please write your questions in the comments. No DM, no health or pregnancy readings. Thanks!
