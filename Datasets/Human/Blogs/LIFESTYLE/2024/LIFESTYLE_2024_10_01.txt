Feel free to share whatever, and however much, of your story as you want. Please keep in mind the community guidelines for posts. You might want to follow this loose structure: - Some background on your drinking - Why you sought to get sober - How your life has been in sobriety Also, feel free to make an actual post and tag it "Saturday Share" and I'll be sure to include it in next week's round up.
