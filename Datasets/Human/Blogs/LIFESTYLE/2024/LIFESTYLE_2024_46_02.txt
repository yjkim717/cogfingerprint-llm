Greetings! My regular G28Z used for establishing Z is situated smack dab in the middle of the Bed which obviously is working as intended but also carries with it the problem of depositing the tiniest amount of leftover Filament still stuck to the at temperature Nozzle resulting in unsightly first Layers I'd prefer to avoid. I've recently setup a Nozzle Brush in an attempt to deal with this but can't really utilize it how I want since I have to Probe Z - which touches the Center of the Bed - before I can clean a hot enough Nozzle - being the cause for the Problem - that can be cleaned to begin with. So yea... Is there a way to have a Custom G28Z - with a different X / Y position - that can be used specifically for cleaning the Nozzle? In my case I'd like to touch off one of the two 8mm Dowel Pins at the back of the Bed used for aligning the Print Surface. Essentially perform the custom G28Z on a Dowel Pin > Do the Nozzle Cleaning > Recalibrate using a regular G28Z smack dab in the middle of the Print Bed. Pretty sure this `Homing_Override` is responsible for taking over my regular G28: Cheers!
