I’m currently writing this while at work, that’s how bored I am. At 23, I’m making a decent wage and writing informational brochures and simple white papers for the state government. It’s not necessarily my dream job, but I do enjoy the research and word-smithing facets of my daily tasks. I’m also working a hybrid and alternative schedule. I’m just incredibly bored if I don’t find the task interesting. I want to do literally anything else other than my work. I’m tired of staring at a screen for hours on end. I’m tired of waiting on meetings then waiting in meetings for hours for SOMEONE to make a decision. I’m tired of people trying to micromanage my work when I’m clearly getting things done on time, so leave me alone and let me do my thing! I don’t know. Writing is something I’ve always enjoyed and several people, even a well-known writing professor, state that I have a natural gift for it. But it’s agitating to read the same things over and over again for hours on end and not learn anything new. (To clarify: Research occurs at the start of my projects. After that, it’s just formatting and proofreading.) After sitting in my office for 9 hours every day, I am desperate to be outside and move my body. My BS is in neuropsychology. I have a minor in anthropology. I considered a certificate in meteorology and nearly received a certificate in AI. One year I wanted to be a forensic scientist or crime scene investigator. The next, an environmental scientist in the mountains. Then a risk analyst for natural disasters. And a welder. And a photographer. I’m paralyzed on where to go next. Any suggestions on how to narrow the choice down?
