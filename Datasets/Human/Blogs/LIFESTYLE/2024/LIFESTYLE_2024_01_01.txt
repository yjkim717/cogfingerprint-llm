Hey all, looking to trade this. Looking for Lv partials, Creed Aventus, really open to anything though. Just hit me with an offer, worst thing I can say is no. Could possibly be open to selling would have to be a good offer. ~~Roja Isola Blu - 35/50 ML condensates just a little bit on atomizer, can send a pic if needed~~ TRADED If you dont commennt before chatting I will not answer.
