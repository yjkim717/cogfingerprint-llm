As a Bills fan, I’m so happy for you guys. I remember when the Bills finally were good, it was surreal seeing them near the top, or at the top of any power rankings. Not that they mean much but the recognition was awesome! 7 years later and it’s still weird actually expecting to win every game. Hows the experience been for you? Go Lions, and keep kicking ass! Lake Erie Super Bowl?!
