I've searched and there's nothing recent, so asking an annoying tourist question. We're getting the bus from Belfast and will arrive at the station across from the Europa at about 9:00 a.m. What's the best way to get across town? It'll be a 40-minute walk, which is not the end of the world, but after flying from Chicago and taking a bus we're going to be pretty knackered. Heading to a friend's house but they don't drive so not much help. Thanks in advance! ETA: Looks like maybe downloading the fonaCAB app is a good idea, but worried my data plan won't be functional without Wifi, which we won't have when we get off the bus.
