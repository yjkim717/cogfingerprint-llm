I love both of these and finally had a chance to try them side-by-side. **Fortnum & Mason's Rose Pouchong** *Ingredients: Tea, Rose - "our Rose Pouchong is made by interleaving rose petals with black tea as it dries"* This has the most dried rose petals in it. The taste is very mellow and rosy. It's a very gentle, warm rose, quite velvety and creamy with milk added. It's something of a pot pourri rose. **Bird & Blend's Belle's Breakfast** *Ingredients: Sri Lankan Black Tea, Kenyan Black Tea, Chinese Black Tea, Rose Petals, Natural Flavouring - " this black tea has been combined with all the delicate notes of an enchanted rose to make your morning a real fairy tale"* This is a very beautiful rose, slightly tarter and fruitier and brighter, the rose is a "higher" note, a bit like smelling a younger lighter rose vs a fuller deeper velvety one. It's a little more of a perfumey rose. **Conclusion** They're both fabulous, it's hard to choose between them. I'd say that if you're in more of a Darjeeling or China Tea mode, wanting something a little sparkly, go for Belle's Breakfast. If you want something mellow and rounded, go for Rose Pouchong.
