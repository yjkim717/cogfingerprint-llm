My family is facing a cross roads. We may have a job opportunity at Hamilton college. I grew up in the Rochester when Kodak still was relevant and ended up moving to the Midwest. I miss my family and would like to be closer, but I really don't know much about Clinton NY. It would be about a 2-4 hour drive to our various families so it's not like we are traveling to a known area with a safety net. What are the schools like? Nature? Things to do? How have the winters been? Is there a quick train or bus to the NYC area? I do miss the beauty of NY state parks but I'd like my next move to be where my two children grow up. If we get a good job offer and make the move, what would life be like?
