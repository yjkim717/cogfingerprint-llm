I get that your taking away an authentic experience meant for a fan, but can't the same things be said about shoe resellers? tbf the scalper put in more effort to acquire those items in the first place, so you're paying premium for that effort put in, the same way I pay for coffee for an insane markup. not a concert ticket scalper, just genuinely curious, thanks. Edit: my question wasnt worded clearly, I want to know what the why a concert ticket scalper is hated more than for example a vintage clothing or antique furniture resellers. thanks
