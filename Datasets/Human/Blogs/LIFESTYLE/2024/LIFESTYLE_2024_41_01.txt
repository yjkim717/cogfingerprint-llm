I know there’s the subreddit for the mobile app but I can’t post there, for whatever reason, and the last post is from 112 days ago so not sure what happened over there. Not sure where to go Whenever I intentionally swipe over to “Latest” or accidentally it’s always dick pics from r/gonewild. Is there a way to block certain subs from that particular feed? I tagged this NSFW since I mentioned the adult sub and dick pics. Better safe than sorry I guess.
