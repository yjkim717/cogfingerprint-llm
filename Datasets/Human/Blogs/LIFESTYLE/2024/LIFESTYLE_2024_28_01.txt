I just learned that Schwalbe doesn't make any of the Marathon tires for 27.5 tubeless anymore. They stopped making not just the Marathon Almotion Evolution that I was running, but any similar tire as well. Marathon Supreme, Marathon Efficiency, none come in 27.5 TLE. I learned that latex tubes have low rolling resistance, but these too seem hard to find in 27.5. Vittoria only seems to offer 700c latex tubes. So I can run an Almotion or Efficiency with a butyl tube. Any other options?
