Legendary Gems absolutely seem to "dry up" in the later game, when you desperately need them. To my mind they should be mineable, perhaps as a rare mine in the Void. I've seen tips to spawn bosses to get them, and use Lighthouses to increase the drops. I did this, but only ever got one drop per monster. It was the Travelling Merchant who saved me. Also once you can afford it, buy every Cosmic Steel you're ever offered (since this technically includes Legendary Gems).
