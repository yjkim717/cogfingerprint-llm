We will be arriving in Alaska (Anchorage) this weekend for a road trip in a camping minivan. We will have proof of test from less than 48h prior to arriving, travel forms filled, and plan to follow strict social distancing rules while there. In order to respect local communities’ efforts, I’ve been trying to find out more about which ones are open to travelers vs those that are refusing any non residents, but couldn’t find a list on government websites. I was wondering if people had some information (or a place we could look) to find out more? Also, maybe some recommendation on places that are better suited for personal road travel atm?
