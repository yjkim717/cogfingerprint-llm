(Posting on behalf of a friend with no reddit skills): Hi all, I'm working on a master's thesis in developmental psychology. I'm asking the question: Will mental health training impact use of the fundamental attribution error? But I can't think of a developmental framework to make this relevant to my department. I'm interested in cognitive biases and demonstrating that they are very resilient. I expect to find that mental health professionals are as guilty of committing the fundamental attribution error as anybody else. But my professor wants a clear tie-in to developmental psychology and human development in context. Vygotsky, Piaget, Aisnworth, Brandura, Bronfenbrenner, etc., all talk about ways the mind changes, not ways it stays the same, so I don't think I can use any of their theories. Any suggestions? Thanks!
