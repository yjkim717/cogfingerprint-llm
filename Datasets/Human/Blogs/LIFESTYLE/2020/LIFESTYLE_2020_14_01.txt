Hello all! What are your favorite simple healthy/fit meals? Mine has been tilapia (or any kind of fish) with lemon and broccoli or asparagus. I hadn't cooked fish prior to the stay at home order, now it is my go-to. How about you all?! Another super simple thing I like to do is cook some boneless skinless chicken breasts in the crock-pot. I cut them up and I will either warm some with some pesto, chimichurri, or teriyaki sauce, or dip the cooked chicken bits in to some garlic hummus.
