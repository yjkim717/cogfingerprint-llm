So I got sent home from school earlier, because there was a gas leak and it was deemed too unsafe to stay present. When we got the news, I was in maths, sitting next to a really nice girl (that I like) and we've been talking quite a bit in lesson. So anyways, we got the news, and the entire class was extremely excited and we all were estatic. We needed parents permission to leave the school, and so all of us were on our phones getting the confirmation messages. She turns to me and says "Why don't we message each other and act like we're both each others parents, that was we can get out? In sure we can eat away with it." I had already messaged my dad, and he gave me permission, so I said no without thinking about it at all. Then it hits me. I just missed a giant opportunity to start speaking to her outside of school and get to know her even better and to start properly talking. Im now extremely gutted and I don't know what to do, considering I just rejected her number. I really want to talk to her, buy I can't now. This has been my biggest fuck up of 2020 by far. TL:DR I fucked up by basically accidentally rejecting a girl I like.
