Hey all, I just realized that my AtoB amount is shown in minus (1426.27) even though all account amounts are correct including the credit card depth. I have tried to checking earlier transactions but the amount in minus is not equal to one or combinations of several transactions I have entered to sheets. Do you have any tip for me explaining how to double check all numbers effecting AtoB? TIA!
