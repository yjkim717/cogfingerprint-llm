I love to spend time in bars with friends, chatting and catching up, but more often than not, one or more people are facing TV's - one for every angle at every seat. It tends to deaden conversation and distract, even if you are not at all interested. To me, I would love to have places advertise that they don't have TV's rather than everywhere fighting for the "game day" crowd. When we want to go out for sports, we do. But other times, we just want music and a place that's away from home. These places are few and far between.. but I will be a regular at the one nearest us! And don't get me started about TV's in public places with the sound blaring. That's a whole other soapbox.
