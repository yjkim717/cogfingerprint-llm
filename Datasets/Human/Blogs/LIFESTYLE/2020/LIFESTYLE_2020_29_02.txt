I have been low-key super unmotivated lately so I need something that can inspire me and put me back in active ambitious mode. I really like the Last Dance, because of its mix of drama, politics, and perseverance. Other documentaries that I have watched and enjoyed but not necessarily in the same genre are: Street Food (asia & latin america), Icarus, explained, Abstract: the art of design, the great hack, game changers, and chef’s table (particularly this because each chef’s story are so inspiring) I also have hulu, prime, and hbo if that helps :) thanks in advance!
