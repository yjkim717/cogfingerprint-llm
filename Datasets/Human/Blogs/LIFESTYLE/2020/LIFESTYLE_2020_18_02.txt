Do be honest I'm not sure i have a great answer. I've listened to probably 200 audiodramas over the last 7 years or so. I'm looking for non anthologies that remain good from start to finish (its ok to have a bad episode here or there). For me personally I would include the following: 1. Bronzeville 2. Video Palace (i recognize that many people didn't like the ending, but I did). What do you guys think?
