Bad idea? Good idea? I heard the quarantine restrictions arenâ€™t as bad over there right now? (source: a resident of SD) Is it a good time to go? Or should I hold off? I just could really use a vacation right now. If good idea, what are some cool areas to check out if I want to UNDERSTAND and vibe with the city? :) (first time to SD)
