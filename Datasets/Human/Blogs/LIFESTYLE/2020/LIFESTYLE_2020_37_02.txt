Hey there, I wonder if I could get some suggestions on how to keep my wig on. I've got a lace front wig I've worn a few times. I used spirit gum the first two times, but it didn't work very well. It's a heavy wig so the spirit gum didn't hold and it was sliding back all the time. Someone at a con told me to use nail glue, so I did that the last time and it worked...a little too well. It hurt to get it off and I had nail glue in my hair for a week afterwords :( Anyone got any other suggestions? Preferably something I can get in a store, because I'm going to a con this Friday. I've also got spirit gum and nail glue tacked onto the lace on my wig. Does anyone know the best way to clean that?
