Good day. So I have 1 two year old. My wife and I are both working from home and we are managing to not have more than 30 min a screen time a day. It is unavoidable. I wish we could go a little longer. I'm just curious if anyone has any educational youtube channel suggestions for a toddler? We also have Amazon prime. I may end up buying another streaming service but I'm not sure we'd have the time to really enjoy it.
