I am so torn right now. My oldest daughter started her first day of college today, 500 miles from our new home...which we just moved into yesterday from out of state. To say it’s been chaotic is an understatement! My daughter has been really nervous about college and being away from home, but seemed to do well for the couple days between when I left after moving her in, and today. In that time she started getting sick though, and is now on quarantine awaiting test results for COVID. I spent the entire weekend with her, so if she has it, I have it. This is my little girl, and I know she’s scared (so am I) and she was already nervous about such a big change with college. I want to bring her home so I can keep an eye on her. But it’s an 8-1/2 hour drive each way, so of course I’ll have to stop for gas/potty breaks, and I can’t do the round trip in one day, so I’d have to sleep somewhere too. I also have two younger kids, my husband and my mom who live with me. My daughter is in an isolation dorm, and there’s a nurse that comes by once/day. My biggest worry is that whenever my daughter gets sick, she’s down for the count. Obviously me not quarantining poses risk to others, which is where my hangup is. We were in very close proximity all weekend, so there’s really no way I wouldn’t get it if she’s positive. What would you do?
