I’ve been admitted to Kellogg and Booth part time. I’m an Engineering Manager who wants to remain in the tech field. Wondering if folks have any opinions on which school i should attended. I’m leaning towards Kellogg bc i feel the people will be more enjoyable (less type-A than booth) and feel like booth is better for finance which i won’t be going into. Would love to hear others’ thoughts!
