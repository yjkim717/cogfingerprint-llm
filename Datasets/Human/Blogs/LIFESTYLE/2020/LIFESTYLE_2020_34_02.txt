I'm playing WITHOUT a headset at the moment on a PS4 Pro. I'm looking at getting an economical headset for casual play. This is my first time playing on consoles, always been on PC 10+ years ago. I'm already top 3 on the leader boards on most individual matches and think a headset would improve my game play. I'm looking at the RIG 500 series but not sure if the 7.1 Stereo of the 500 HS would be just fine for casual play or if I should go ahead and opt for 500 HC with Dolby Atmos. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;
