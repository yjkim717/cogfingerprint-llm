Hello everyone, I'm looking to build a powerhouse PC for gaming, video/graphic design, etc. Basically heavy-end stuff as I am looking to get into design for gaming and such. &#x200B; For motherboards I am stuck between these two: Asus TUF X570-Plus: &#x200B; Crosshair VIII Hero Wifi: &#x200B; Other than the WiFi capabilities, is there any reason to pick the Hero over the TUF? Or would the TUF be completely sufficient? &#x200B; And on a related note regarding CPU and GPU: Is the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 3.7 GHz 12-Core Processor and the Asus GeForce RTX 3090 24 GB TUF GAMING Video Card absolutely necessary for this build? Or would I be able to get away with ones that are a bit lower tiered so I don't need to spend as much? Money is not necessarily an issue but I do like to save where I can. Thanks for all of your help!
