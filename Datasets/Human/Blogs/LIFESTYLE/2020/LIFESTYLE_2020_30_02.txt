Rocky 4 was released on November 27, 1985. This was the one where Rocky took down the big bad Russian boxer, who killed Apollo Creed in an exhibition match. Chernobyl, for those who need a reminder, happened early in the morning on Saturday 26 April 1986. This is obviously a shitpost but please feel free to ruminate on how the plot of Rocky 4 might have been different if it was filmed and released after the accident.
