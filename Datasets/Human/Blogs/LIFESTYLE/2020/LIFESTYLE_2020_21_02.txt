I personally keep it a secret. I’m normally a pretty private person in general, but for this there’s a little bit more of a reason. First off they aren’t my audience, I created this channel to find other people who want to talk about what my channel is about. Also I feel like youtube is one of those things that’s kinda looked at as weird unless you made it big. Also people on my dads side of the fam are really close and I would probably have aunts, uncles, and grandmas watching my videos which isn’t exactly what I want lmao. How about you?
