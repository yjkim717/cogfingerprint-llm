&#x200B; Still Stuck... For, at least, the past 2 weeks or so I've been stuck on this *Signing In... (* *sisu.xboxlive.com* *)* Screen. I tried: * Reloading Desktop and Mobile Websites * Restarting the Game * Restarting the Apple iPad Pro 11" ( iPad OS 13.3 ) * Reinstalling ( *and* Updating ) the Game Nothing gets it past that stuck *Signing In...* Screen...
