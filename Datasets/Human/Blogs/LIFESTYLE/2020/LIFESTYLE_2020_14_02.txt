Hello all, It looks like I am going to be thrust into my first real PM gig soon. I have held a project management role before but it was more of an event management role and we didn't actually use any traditional PM practices. Before I step into this new role I would like to do as much reading and prep as I can so it, at least, looks like I know what I am doing. What books or resources would you all recommend I start with? Thanks in advance!
