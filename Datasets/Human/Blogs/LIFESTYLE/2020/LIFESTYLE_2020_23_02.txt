While my friend and I were exploring in the Bray Exoscience and Eternity area during the Europa Legs quest, we found the second stasis chest in Eternity. We unlocked this before we got the Europa Arms quest, and now we cannot get the chest for the second part of the quest. Anyone have an idea as to how this can maybe get fixed?
