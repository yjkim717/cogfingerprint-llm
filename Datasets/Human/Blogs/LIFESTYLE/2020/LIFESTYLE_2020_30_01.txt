At the beginning of S02E08 "The Big Sleep" we see Darlene spike the heroin with what is presumably fentanyl (although as has been discussed here before this is probably an inaccurate depiction as Darlene dumps a bunch of pills out of a prescription bottle, and prescribed fentanyl usually comes in the form of transdermal patches). Then, she pulverizes the pills and sprinkles it on top of a bucket of heroin and mixes it with a wooden stick. This is a terrible way to ensure uniform distribution of the fentanyl booster. A better way, as shown in this Vice video, is to dissolve both the heroin and pure fentanyl powder in water, where it will mix thoroughly and easily, then dry it again. On the other hand, maybe Darlene didn't care if her way made a totally uneven spike, since she was trying to kill people anyway.
