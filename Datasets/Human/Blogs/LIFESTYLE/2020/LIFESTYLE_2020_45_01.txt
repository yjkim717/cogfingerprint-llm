I was running some numbers the other day, and despite making a good living it seems like saving a lot after having children requires a decent amount of sacrifice. This has made me realize I’m more likely to be a peruser of Coast FI - but i don’t see any large/active communities for the topic. There’s r/CoastFI and r/CoastFIRE but those have under 100 members each. Is there another community focused on Coast FI that people know about? If not, i may start posting about it here!
