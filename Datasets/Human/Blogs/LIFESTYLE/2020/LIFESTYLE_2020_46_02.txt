Greetings! I live in Switzerland which the Valve Index does not ship to so I'm trying to get one via a Family members friend living in Germany but he has troubles ordering it with the issue being tied to "Free Accounts" not being able to order one which kinda puzzles me ( trying to get him to send me a screenshot ) since I recall no service being available to warrant a "Paid Account" flag other than buying a game - He just created an account for my request which, obviously, has no games yet purchased which could easily be solved by just buying one to get the flag of a "Paid Account". Can anyone confirm my guess?
