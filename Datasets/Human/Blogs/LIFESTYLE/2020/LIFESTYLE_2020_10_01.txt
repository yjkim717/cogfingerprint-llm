In the last few days, many users have told us that they are receiving notifications that "/r/stopdrinking mods have updated their flair to read: <some day count> days" ~~We're not exactly sure what's happening, but we're reaching out to Reddit staff to track down the problem.~~ ~~**IF YOU WANT THE NOTIFICATIONS TO STOP**: Our only known way to stop these notifications is to remove your badge by using this link and clicking "send".~~ ~~Yes, this means no badge (for now) :-( Once we track down a different way to stop the notifications, we'll let you know how and you'll be able to add your badge back without notifications.~~ ~~Thanks for your patience while we work on getting this solved!~~ ~~If you want further, nerdy troubleshooting information, see the stickied comment down below~~ **UPDATE as of 2020-06-22 3:00pm Pacific time** Turns out the Reddit staff had enabled an experimental feature for a subset of users that would send notifications when their user flair is updated. Reddit has turned off this feature as of this morning and will make some adjustments on how it works. So, no one should be getting these notifications anymore for now. Please let us know if you see these notifications any more and we'll pass that along to the staff. Thanks for bearing with us! If you want to reinstate your badge now, this link walks you through the process.
