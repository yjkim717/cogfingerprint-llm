Hey guys, I dont know if this belongs here, but we will see. My hobby is modeling, I love modeling dioramas filled with my hand made assets. However, I feel like they are a bit too static and I would love to sacrifice a bit of quality for some dynamic interaction. My question is, which board games are made in a style which would fit together with hand made dioramas ? I know how to draw, so I would have no problems making tiled board with my assets placed around. Is there any universal format, which would fit most RPG style games (just tiles etc.) or does litreally every RPG game have its own style which I would have to focus on ? Thanks.
