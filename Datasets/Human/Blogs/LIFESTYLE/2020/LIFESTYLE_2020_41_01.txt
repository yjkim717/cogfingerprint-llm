Everyone pours a drink when they walk in a room, and it's always straight liquor. They drink A LOT. Im 35, been going out and drinking socially for about 15 years. I RARELY ever see anyone drink straight liquor, whether it's at a bar, social gathering, house party..etc I always notice in movies and TV such as Ray Donovan, Kingdom and so many others...EVERYONE drinks just straight liquor. Not even ice. Even the top shelf that is smoother, I rarely see anyone drink it without a mixer of sorts. I know it's the movies, it's Hollywood..etc. I've just always noticed it
