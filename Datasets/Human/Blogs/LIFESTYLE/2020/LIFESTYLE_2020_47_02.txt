Hi! I was recently looking for a solution on how to make my work more entertaining because I struggled to make myself motivated for a long time. After long research and experimenting I defined 7 steps to make your work more attractive and engaging: Step 1: Set a Vision for Your Life Step 2: Create a Strategy Step 3: Define Your Daily activities Step 4: Set Up Your Work Environment Step 5: Change Your Mindset Step 6: Make Your Work More Flow-Friendly Step 7: Use Great Work Techniques &#x200B; The biggest discovery for me was the new Technique - Work Cycles. It is a technique based on a google spreadsheet created by Ultraworking. In a spreadsheet, you write what you are going to do for the next 30 minutes. Then you start working and review your results afterward. Then you have a break for 10 minutes and repeat. What are your thoughts on that? If you want to read more about it, you can read it here:
