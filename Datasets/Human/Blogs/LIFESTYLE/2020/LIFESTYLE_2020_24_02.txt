Hi guys, I've got a 2004 Ford Fiesta mk5 zetec (1.4 petrol). Theres a problem with the car not starting properly when it's raining. It either just about starts and then runs really rough until the engine is warmed up or sometimes It wont start at all. On a dry day it starts and runs great. Any idea what the cause might be? Thanks!
