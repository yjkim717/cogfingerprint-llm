Initial thoughts on comparing N20U to P5 - Originally bought the N20U because of the impressive screen and heavy handed camera hardware but after a few weeks had some major cons. More below: &#x200B; **The Good:** * Size & weight on the P5 is fantastic. I knew going in the N20U was going to be a huge brick but god damn if it isn't hard to hold or stuff into a pocket while clad in a case. * Camera results are great so far especially portrait mode and low light interior shots. Despite the heavy handed hardware in the N20U the photo results were consistently meh especially front selfie shots or anything with the slightest movement. * Plastic back is a pro IMO. With a screen protector I don't feel the fear against drops like I do with the giant glass brick. * Stock launcher is stock launcher. No ads in stock apps unlike Samsung Pay or weather. * Battery life is fantastic so far. &#x200B; **The Bad:** * Results may vary on 120hz vs 90hz but I do notice the difference when scrolling in apps like Instagram or Boost (reddit). N20U feels much smoother. * Photo share in Google photos in better on N20U vs P5, weird that. I use the create link to share videos and photos and avoid the quality hit when sending via SMS. On the P5 there is the side scrolling share to app bar but Samsung offers a bigger pull down popup with option to copy link. Wish P5 had this feature. * While photos results are great I'm finding my friends new 12 Pro takes better point & shoot photos even in low light settings. Also why does google call it an Ultrawide lens when the competition is mostly offering wider view angles. &#x200B; TL/DR: Replacing N20U with P5 and will give Google a go for a few weeks. Depending on how I feel about the camera overall I might be tempted to try to 12 Pro once inventory levels stabilize and I can grab one in store.
