I keep having trouble getting this trophy because I have absolutely no friends that have madden 21 and i keep playing matches but every time I start to win my opponent quits. Can someone please help me with this on PlayStation by sending me your gamer tag, I will help you as well if you want. Itâ€™s the only trophy o need for the platinum.
