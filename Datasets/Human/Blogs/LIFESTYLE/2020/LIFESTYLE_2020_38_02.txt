I don't feel lonely anymore. I am happy that someone exists out there who cares for me, who would be happy if I am happy. No matter how temporary this feeling is, I'm cherishing it to the best I can. And that gives me hope. For that someone may not be the last person to give me such attention. I am glad. And I am hopeful. Hopeful for a better morrow. Wherever I go, I hope I find such people. But more than that, I hope that I find the one. For she exists out there, perhaps she and I were classmates, or she and I are complete strangers, or she and I are friends having fun. I am patiently waiting and I am hopeful. For a better morrow.
