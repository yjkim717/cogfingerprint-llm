I’m wondering what’s the best 3 season clothing setup for the upper, given that bottoms are pretty straightforward (running shorts + windpants). Here are some options: -button up + puffy -long-sleeve base layer + fleece -something else entirely? The first two would give about the same warmth, keeping you warm to about 40ish while moving depending on how warm you run (I run cold). Thoughts?
