I am a 40-year-old overweight woman. This morning, I got out of my car, walked about 10 steps and looked up at a tree. I had a sudden, brief moment of dizziness. My knees felt like they were going to buckle at the same time. My vision may have been blurred. It passed within seconds, but I was left with a headache at the back of my head, where my head meets my neck, and a metallic taste in my mouth. I have never had something like this happen before, other than occasional wooziness when standing up from a bent-over position (I am a gardener). Yesterday I worked in my garden at home for about 5 hours, doing fairly strenuous work in the hot sun. I didn't drink enough water through the day, but I made up for it in the evening and this morning. I quit smoking 2.5 years ago. I eat a fairly decent mostly plant-based diet, with probably twice weekly indulgences like pizza or breakfast sandwiches. I am overweight, so those indulgences aren't usually just small bites, of course. I am happy to answer questions. My goal in posting this is to know what steps I should take - do I need a doctor asap? Can I go to a GP after waiting for an appointment? I am insured, but I need to find a new GP, as my old one left the area about a year and a half ago, and I have yet to find a new one.
