On many websites, I don't type specific routes in search bar to visit specific sections, instead I would visit the site and click on a sequence of links to achieve a certain task. For instance, if I want to view the profile of my friend on Facebook, my user journey would be to click on his profile picture which seems more natural rather than remembering this route. The same holds true for my interaction with a lot of social media platforms like twitter and reddit which are certainly non trivial apps. Single Page Applications has been my first exposure to frontend development and in my mental model, there is no such thing as a \*page\*. Instead, what we view is a hierarchy of nested visual components which it is made interactive by resizing, transforming and replacing these components when we interact with it; much like desktop apps. I am unable to fit routing anywhere in this model. That said, I can think of one scenario where routing or something similar may be necessary; sharing a specific resource on internet such as a video on youtube, a facebook post etc. It would require a stable uniform resource locator. Aside from it, I cannot think of a use case for routing. I am worried because I think I am missing something fundamental here due to the emphasis placed on routing by everyone. I am unexpectedly hitting many roadblocks like this now which is slowing up my progress because I usually like to think from first principles and I ended up learning React because it vaguely resembled how I would have liked to create web pages. Any suggestion or direction is welcome.
