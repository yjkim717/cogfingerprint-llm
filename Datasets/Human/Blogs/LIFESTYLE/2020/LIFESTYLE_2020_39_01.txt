i’ve recently started to get into manifestation/spirituality and am not really sure what to do/where to start and was wondering if anyone had any tips? i’ve basically started with writing down all my goals in life/2021, things i’m grateful for, and a daily compliment to myself also i’m sorry if this type of post isn’t allowed!!
