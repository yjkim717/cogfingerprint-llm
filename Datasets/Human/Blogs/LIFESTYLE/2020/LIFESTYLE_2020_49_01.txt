Hi, I have recently discovered Aspire and I think it is the correct solution for me. I am an expatriate living in Dubai. I have incomes and liabilities in the countries that I live in and I am from. Those are in different currencies and from time to time I need to fund my accounts back home to cover my mortgage payment etc. In addition, I also make investments monthly through an international brokerage platform based in the USA. However, I have some questions based on this scenario to make a good and correct start; \- I used YNAB before so I am aware of how Aspire works in general. On YNAB, I was trying to manage my home country account and salary accounts in the same budget but it didn't really work because the exchange rate keeps changing, I keep some of the money in the gold and USD accounts so there are ups and downs. Impossible to track it down a penny to penny. I am thinking of setting up two separate budgets for them. Do you have a better suggestion? If no, should I download the aspire budget sheet once again to have two separate budgets? \- Thinking of creating an account with name Investment and track the only the amount that I will monthly invest there to have an idea how much I originally invest. I think it is better to check the loses and gains on the brokerage platform itself. Hope someone can help. TIA guys!
