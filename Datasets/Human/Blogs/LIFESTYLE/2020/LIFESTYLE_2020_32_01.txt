I like to solo travel by myself sometimes because I think it's really fun. I have Sunday and Monday off and am completely BORED staying at home and going to the city very under stimulating right now. What are some road trips I can take 30 minutes - 3 hours that would be a nice getaway from the Seattle vibe? Somewhere fun to be despite the pandemic?
