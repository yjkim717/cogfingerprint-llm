Hello fellow Sobernauts! I'm your stand-in Book and Movie host for the next two weeks. I like to have a few books going at once. I normally have a reading specifically from my recovery program, another book that covers self-help/recovery/personal growth in general, and a fiction book. For personal growth, I recently finished _Daring Greatly_ by Bren√© Brown which was _very_ powerful! A lot of my drinking was a misguided effort to drown and numb out my shame. Looking back, that's like using gas to put out a fire. _Daring Greatly_ isn't about sobriety per se, but about learning to be vulnerable as a means to combat shame. I'm discovering that shame is pretty much my default emotion and response and I gained a lot of great insights and techniques from this book. As for fiction, I'm a sucker for Space Opera. I just wrapped up the second book in Peter F. Hamilton's _Salvation_ series and I *can't wait* until the final book is out! Most of his work ends with a Deus Ex Machina-type solution which might rub people the wrong way, but I've always enjoyed the over-the-top journey I'm taken on, regardless of how it ends. A lot of the sci-fi I read is just about exploring new ideas and possibilities and seeing the world in a new way, a lot like my non-fiction reading, but done in a bit more fun way ;-) Movies? Haven't recently seen many that I can recommend. My wife and I have about...oh, 25 seconds of free time to ourselves at the end of the night, so there's no time to sit down and watch a full movie! But we do binge-watch TV series pretty regularly. Last month we discovered and *devoured* _Schitt's Creek_. It is, by far, one of the best series, I've ever watched. It's not only consistently hilarious, but full of great, loving moments without being sappy. The series ends in a very nice way as well. It was nice to watch a cast of characters find gratitude and grace in rough situations and grow as people. It bolstered my own desire to keep moving forward no matter the situation while filling my heart with good feelings at the end of a long day. I can't recommend it enough. I'd love to hear what fun or thought-provoking things you've read/watched lately?
