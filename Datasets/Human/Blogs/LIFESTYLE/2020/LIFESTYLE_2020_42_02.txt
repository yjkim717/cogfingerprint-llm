I work at a small locally owned grocery store and we only have one bathroom in the entire store and it is located In the back. It is considered an employee restroom but we let customers use it if they ask but now they are taking advantage of it . Nobody asks anymore and since Christmas is 3 days away, we have a ton of business and when I went to the restroom, there were at least 7 customers in line waiting to use it as well so I left and decided to come back later. Later, I had to go really bad and when I got to the bathroom the line was even longer this time but I had to go bad so I waited through it. It took almost 30 minutes to get through everyone and when I finally got in the restroom it smelt so bad, I also told threw up even though I was wearing my mask. I powered through it but I’m so pissed that I had to wait that long to use the “ employee” restroom. I still feel sick from the smell of the restroom so I decided to eat very little for lunch. Fuck customers
