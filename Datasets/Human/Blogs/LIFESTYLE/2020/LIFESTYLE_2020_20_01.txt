For what it's worth, I had a great experience today at Forest Planet's electronics recycling event this morning. It's going on until 6pm. I recently cleaned my garage and found lots of misc. electronics that needed to go. The organization keeps tons of used electronics out of landfills, and plants thousands of trees at the same time! They made it efficient and fun, and I feel better knowing that what I recycled (for a very small fee) helps reforestation efforts around the world.
