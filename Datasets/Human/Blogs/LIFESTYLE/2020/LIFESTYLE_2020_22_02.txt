So recently got a radon detector, it's measuring levels between 5 to 9pCI/L in the basement. We spend a lot of time in the basement, it's where our TV is and our home offices. I think this is high right? Is this emergency levels high? Did I already damage myself? Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm just trying to get some clarity, should I contact some sort of radon mitigation specialist asap and risk bringing in strangers into the house that could potentially spread covid? Or should I wait? Or is this level not that bad? Any advice from people that have dealt with this before?
