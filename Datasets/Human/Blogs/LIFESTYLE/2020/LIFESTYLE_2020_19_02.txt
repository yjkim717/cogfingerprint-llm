I'm in the market for a hot tub. I went up to a local retailer who was pushing me towards this hot tub: He could give me a deal for $8,000 including delivery and setup. He kept selling me on the "full foam insulation" and circulation pump. Both sound appealing given their benefits. Is this a good deal on a hot tub? I'm not sure what price range I should be looking at. I'm mostly looking for something that will not be a huge electricity bill increase, won't start giving me problems (major problems at least) 3-5 years in, has good insulation for year round use (in the midwest), and can comfortably seat 6 people. I don't care much for a bunch of jets, speakers, etc. I decided to look over at Royal Spas as well. They all started at $15k and were up to about $19k. I didn't ask if it were MSRP or not, but I should have. I sort of assumed it wasn't and that was the actual price. Long story short, seeing other hot tubs being priced twice as much made me start second guessing the one I linked above. It's gotta be half the price for some reason, but I'm not sure why. Is 8k (with delivery and setup) a good deal? Or is this just a cheap tub for a reason. I'm not entirely sure.
