Can we stop pretending like the virus situation is back to normal!? I see everyone acting like the lockdown has been ended and they seem to have forgotten about the social distancing. Well, the bitter truth is that all the districts of Delhi are red zoned and cases are rising rapidly everyday. This situation ain't getting any better if y'all go out and pretend like the virus is gone.
