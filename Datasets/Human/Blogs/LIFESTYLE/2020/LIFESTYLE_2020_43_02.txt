As a web developer, I am trying to understand how WordPress ecosystem works, specifically the integration of plugins with WordPress core and other plugins. However, I am unable to find this information on internet because all of my google searches turn up results intended to be read by consumers of plugins. As such, most of the resources available on internet define a WP plugin as a piece of software which extends capabilities of WP. This characterization of plugin may be useful for someone developing websites with WordPress but it doesn't help me understand what a plugin actually is. I would be grateful, if somebody could answer these questions. * What is a WordPress plugin and where does it sit in the client/server architecture model? * Does it run on backend written in PHP, or on frontend using JavaScript or a combination of both? If it is a widget, should it include HTML and CSS as well and if so how can one ensure it could be plugged into any WordPress template without breaking UI/UX? * If it runs on frontend as well backend, how does it connect with database? * This is the question which is extremely confusing for me, Plugins are generally written to be used by many people so how can plugins interact with all sorts of databases? The structure of tables in MySQL could be different for each database and plugins are supposed to work without dropping to code. * Why don't plugins break the functionality of other plugins used on the website? Thanks in advance!
