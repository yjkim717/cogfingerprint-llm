So I'm ready to upgrade my Dell xps 8500. I think it is from around 2010. Im looking to build my fist pc since most of the pre built do not come with optic drive space. And I need them. I play games but I don't usually play newer games. I do play football manager 2020, but that does not require good graphics. I also play civ 5 once awhile. So mainly I'm looking to build a pc that would last me the next 7 years or so. Mainly for daily use and very light gaming. Could someone provide me some suggestions on CPU/ GPU combo? Last, I my budget is at $800, and I already have the optic drive. I could also re use the HDD from my old Dell as well. Thanks
