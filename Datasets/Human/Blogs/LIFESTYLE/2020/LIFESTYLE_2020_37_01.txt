Hi there, I've been wanting to jump back into MC for a while but it's just no fun to play alone :( I've vaguely looked at online stuff but it all seems so complicated and full of rules and I just get confused. all I've ever done is play on my ex's realm with him, so I don't really understand a lot of the online stuff/rules and all that. I have discord and I live in North America. Anyone looking for a new friend to casually play with? I just want to build and explore but not alone! Oh and I play on PC!
