This is for all the men that I threw away or just let go of. C, S, B, JR, B, and T. I’m sorry. You deserve better than somebody who only goes after people for the adrenaline rush of the chase for romantic attraction. You deserve better than somebody who is sour towards physical affection, yet craves it to the point of thinking about it nonstop. You deserve better than somebody who doesn’t know how to resolve conflicts or comfort you at your worst. You deserve somebody who will acknowledge your interests and gain your trust properly, instead of through manipulation. This is for the only one I want. A, I’m sorry, but I am trying this time. I will talk and communicate and give you my internal workings until they are seared by the heat of your love. It will hurt, pain always accompanies change for me, but I know I need to change. Please, see all my flaws and my past and understand that I want to change and that I want you to be a part of it. I love you.
