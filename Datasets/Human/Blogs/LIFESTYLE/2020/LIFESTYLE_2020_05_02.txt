I'm using DIY co2 at the moment and have tried various diffusers. For the most part, they've been crap and aren't sealed properly, resulting in weak diffusion. I have heard people get good results with sticking the tube into their HOB intake. So far it has been working, but I think it could be better. Mainly, I think I need an airstone or something that will chop the bubbles before they go up to the impeller. I was using a piece of chopstick and it worked nicely for a few days. My indicator was a nice lime green. But, the chopstick has gone soft and is releasing larger bubbles at this point. My indicator has stayed blue. The air stone I have is the right size for the job, but it performs poorly when it isn't horizontal(it will be vertical in my setup). Does anyone have a preferred small airstone for (as micro as possible) micro bubbles? What else can I use? If you couldn't tell from my setup, cheaper is preferred. I don't want to spend $40 on a small GLA diffuser just to stick it into my hob. I'll save that for a nicer setup in the future :P
