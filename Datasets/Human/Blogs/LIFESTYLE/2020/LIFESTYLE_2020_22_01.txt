My 10 year old keyboard just died. I would usually go to microcenter and try these out... but you know, global pandemic and all. Blue and brown sound pretty cool, but i have no idea. Is there a thing you can order which has all the buttons and I can try them out? Any other suggestions? I really need a new keyboard, and some asshole linked me to this subreddit now I'm obsessed and I haven't even bought anything. Any advice? Should I just get cherry mx blue? Or is there a way to test all this out?
