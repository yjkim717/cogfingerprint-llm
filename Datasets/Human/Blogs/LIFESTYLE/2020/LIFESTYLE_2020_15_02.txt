I had to do a speech on any topic (which I won't say because it's controversial) for my English Language GCSE and I got the best grade. I literally am the worst public speaker too, so I was really really nervous. I also had 6 months to write it but due to my extreme procrastination, I left it until last night to write a 6 minute speech. But I got a distinction and I'm just happy about it.
