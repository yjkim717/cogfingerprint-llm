Hey everyone, I am a fairly new user when it comes to the CPAP machine. I have tried two masks so far: Phillips NuancePro and ResMed N30. So far my favorite is the ResMed N30 by far, I absolutely love how comfortable it is while using it. It pretty much just hugs my nose naturally. I have a few questions about it though: What is the best way to clean the tube attachment with the tiny little air holes in it? It eventually builds up black spots or particles inside and I want to know what's the best way to clean it properly. What is a good N30 mask alternative? I am curious to know if there are other masks with a similar nasal pillow style that also work well. And for side sleeping: How do you do it while wearing your CPAP masks? I find it always gets pushed off a bit so air escapes. And being confined to my back all night causes pain for me. I would like to be able to move around. Thank you for all of your help and suggestions!
