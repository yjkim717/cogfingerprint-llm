because the problem is our addiction to the BEHAVIOR OF BEING ADDICTED TO HAVING AN ORGASM, FAPPING AND WATCHING PORN. I've seen too many guys commenting here that "I don't know how women can benefit from nofap/noporn because they don't lose sperm".. The problem isn't the loss of sperm. Sperm isnt the problem. Sperm isn't magic juice. if it was the problem the people who didnt fap or watch porn but who had sex regularly would also have the same problems as fap addicts, BUT THEY DON'T Do you see? We are not 'sperm collecting'... we're trying to stop fapping and porn....we're trying to stop running to fapping and porn when we feel stressed, sad, lonely or bored. Women, just like men, experience this problem, and experience the same benefits when they stop. because the benefits come from STOPPING THE ADDICTION and getting your life back
