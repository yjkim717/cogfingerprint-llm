I have decided to get my act together and document it in blog posts. I have made already 2 blog posts about my journey. I present step-by-step on what I do. Check it if you're interested. I think it might help especially those people who feel lost. The first blog post was inspired by lectures of Dr Jordan B. Peterson.
