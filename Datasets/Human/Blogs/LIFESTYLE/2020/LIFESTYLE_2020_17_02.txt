Hi all, at the start of the year I book my theory test for Friday of this week. However I've been stressing over it in the last three days. I have been using both the 4 in 1 and DVSA (which one of my mates told me to use) and been revising all the way since December (doing two theory mock test per day) and been learning to drive from September (haven't missed a week of lesson). My lowest score on the 4 in 1 has been 42 recently and my highest score has been about 48. On the DVSA app my lowest score was 41 and been averaging 43 with 5 fails and 13 passes. I just started to do the hazard perception like last week (like I said been driving since September) and seem like just tapping my screen hasn't been as responsive as I like. I've been failing them with 39 and 40 out of the 75 but ran through each clip beforehand with a score of 3 on average sometimes 0 but other times 4 or even 5. Just did one using the Theory test online website and scored a 56/75. I really don't know if I should just postpone it or actually take it. Does anyone know any good hazard perception sites cause I feel that if anything I would pass the multiple choice but my fear is within the hazard perception part of the exam.
