I have been using squarespace for quite sometime but never keep up with the latest features. I stumbled upon ilovecreatives .com squarespace online course. While it looks really interesting (and puno is hilarious), i canâ€™t justify the price of $899/course. If any of you has enrolled in her course before, I would like to know your opinion!
