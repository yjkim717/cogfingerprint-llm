I just recently got a new dog (greyhound) and have recently been very overwhelmed by the responsibility. Although I have had a couple dogs growing up, it was my parents who normally took care of them. Now I'm living alone in an apartment and have that sole responsibility. I chose a greyhound because they are supposed to be couch potatoes, and I am a student who is used to spending all his time staring at a computer. I've only had him for a couple of days now but he has already stolen my heart. However, I am worried that he has too much energy for me. He will sleep for 3 hours or so at a time but then be up and ready to do something. I always feel bad when I am unable to do anything with him and have to send him back to his couch. I am constantly worried that I'm making him unhappy. Earlier today he peed in the apartment for the first time, and I initially I blamed him but then realized that it was probably my fault for not taking him out enough. I love him dearly and really do not want to have to give him up, but I am doubting my own ability to keep him.
