I have a 15” Lodge that I LOVE. I would cook with it every day if I could (I like to cook enough to have leftovers). Unfortunately it only *just* fits on my big burner. The outer inch or so of the bottom hangs out further than the burner, so while it’ll eventually heat up pretty evenly, it’s still noticeably cooler on the outer edge. I’m going to be replacing my stovetop soon, it’s a 36” stovetop and electric. I’m having trouble finding a stovetop with a burner big enough to cover the whole bottom. I’m considering induction, but I don’t know if I’ll end up with the same problem. I wasn’t totally sure where to ask this question, and since I’ve seen a lot of love for these beasts of a skillet, I thought y’all might have some ideas. I figure if I can find a stovetop to fit this skillet, it’ll fit pretty much anything else I want to cook with too. Any ideas?
