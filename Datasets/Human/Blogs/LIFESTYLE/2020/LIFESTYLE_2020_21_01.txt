First off I don’t really care what others think of the show, I love it lmao. But every time I bring it up to my friends (who btw haven’t watched it) they say it’s a chick show or assume I’m watching it with/for a girl. Maybe my friends are just assholes lmao I’ve never seen the trailers so idk if it gives off that vibe or what. Also Sarah Cameron is the most attractive character ever created
