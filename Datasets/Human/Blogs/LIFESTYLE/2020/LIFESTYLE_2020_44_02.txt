I played vigilant as a mage. I have ordinator and the apocalypse spell package. I downloaded the english voice acting because I would get square brackets for text dialogue. But the voice acting was crap, as expected with these mods. I honestly prefer no voice acting to amateur voice acting, especially when the npcs have mixed filler dialouge with vanilla skyrim npcs. Example, they would say things like "make it quick!" or "be careful with that spell!". Typical npc stuff. Then when you talk to them, it's a teenager with their voice cracking behind a microphone on max volume. For a mod, I was impressed with its efforts to push immersion with the lore of the daedra. At first. Then, I found a corpse with bloodborne gear. If that wasn't bad enough, the npcs in oblivion have dark souls armor. I get the mod is heavily inspired by dark souls, but it was too on the nose. What's worse, playing as a mage makes it easy. Nothing was a challenge compared to the enemies I faced in skyrim with my normal mod loadout. The mansion wasn't scary, it was more edgy than scary, and the whole time I'm playing it, the more I thought "I should go play dark souls". Because it's better. I wandered oblivion for a bit, but got bored and didn't feel motivated to finish. Also, the music in the obilvion map is the same as the skyrim world. I'm in a dreary world, but it's filled with happy music. It was honestly terrible.
