A friend had told me that pressure treated lumber was twice as expensive right now. I'm in need of some PT lumber and was looking at Home Depot and other big box stores in the Midwest. A 4x4x12 PT costs me $30, and a 2x6x12 PT costs me $16. Would these be the prices I would be paying a year ago? I was messing around with the wayback machine on home depot and it looks like the price was half this back in 2017. A lot has happened since then, not just related to the pandemic, so I'm sure it would increase regardless. Just trying to decide if I should do my project this year or next year. Total price will be $450 for the lumber I need. I wonder if I did it in 2021 if it would be much lower. I know there is no way to know for sure.
