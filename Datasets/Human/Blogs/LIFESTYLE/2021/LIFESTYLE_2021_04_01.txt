We built a garage this year, and we made a fancy house number plaque of wood and metal numbers to hang on it. We used siding clips to attach it to the siding, Sood back, and admired our work. Then it blew off the garage 1 month later. We put it back up, and it came down again in a week. It is only a couple of pounds, so it is not a weight issue. How did people do this before siding clips? Is it ok to drill into it (with a stud behind) and just seal it with caulk? What about hanging heavier things like trellises and planters? My main home is brick, so I feel like a first time home owner here!
