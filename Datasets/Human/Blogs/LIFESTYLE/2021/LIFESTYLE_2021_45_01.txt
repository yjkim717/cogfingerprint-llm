A little context, I am interested in buying a \~100k investment property. I currently do not own a primary residence, but would be looking to buy one in the \~700k range in the next 1.5 - 2 years. I am wondering if my investment property will effect my ability to be approved for a mortgage on my future primary residence given that timeline, thanks!
