I have been using my Resmed Airsense 10 with the Airfit N30 mask for around half a year now and I can definitely tell I get more sleep with it than I used to without it. I have been using a chin strap because I am a mouth breather during the night but I have decided to grow out my beard and the strap is not comfortable anymore. It actually makes it more difficult to fall asleep because of the lack of comfort. I don't think full face masks work with beards and I was looking into the Airfit N30i or Phillips Dreamwear as my next mask because I like how the tube goes up to the top of the head to release extra airflow so it wouldn't bother my wife when I face her in my side. For those of you they have beards and are mouth breathers: What have you found that works for you? I'm tired of waking up with a dry mouth/throat and I also know that mouth breathing isn't good for oral hygiene and can disrupt your sleep on its own.
