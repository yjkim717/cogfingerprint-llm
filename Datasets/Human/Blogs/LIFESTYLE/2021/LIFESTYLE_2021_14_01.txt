I'm not sure where else to ask this, so I'll try asking this lovely group! I'm moving into a new building and they require a certified check as a damage deposit for move-in. If I don't cause any damage they said they will give it right back to me. I requested the certified check from my credit union in the amount needed and made it out to the association as requested. When I called my bank and asked them how to redeposit the funds into my account they said that I could not, that the association would have to write me a check back. The check was made out to them, so the money is theirs. They claim that is not right and that my bank should happily give me my money back. They are refusing to deposit my check and write me one back for the funds. I feel that I am just out of luck. It was only $500 so it's not like it was thousands but I'm pretty frustrated about the whole situation. I realize now I should have asked upfront about the 'return policy' but they assured me this is how they always do it and it's never an issue.
