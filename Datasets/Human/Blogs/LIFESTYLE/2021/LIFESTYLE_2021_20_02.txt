Hi all, I'm a high school junior auditioning for the Virginia Governor's School in theater (using my parent's reddit account to post this). My adjudication slot is this Friday, January 8. Can anyone provide any insight into the process, tips, or encouragement? I'm working with an acting coach to prepare, and I know that I need to wear a mask the entire time. Any thoughts appreciated! Thank you
