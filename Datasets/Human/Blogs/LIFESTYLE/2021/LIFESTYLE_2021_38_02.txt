We used to date until few months ago, and then we stopped talking altogether...until last week when they texted me the news. I was devastated, and God knows how are they dealing with it. Their birthday is near, and I want to do something for their mental health. As I was talking to them yesterday, generally checking up on them... They said "mental health is not a priority"... And I know that in some countries, there's a law that when a relative dies, they're bound to attend therapy sessions to cope with the loss, or at least to accept it. Unfortunately, it's not the case in my country. Only few people care about mental health. How can I recommend them to go for therapy sessions to deal with the tragedy that has happened?
