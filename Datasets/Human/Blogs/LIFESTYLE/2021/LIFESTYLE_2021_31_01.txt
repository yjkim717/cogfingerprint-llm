i am struggling with getting our kitchen to not look like a storage. due to the pandemic my parents stocked on alot of things, nothing that doesnt have a proper place, but it does require a few minutes of organizing. so whats been resorted to is just piles of food on the floor. and they keep bringing in more because noone knows where anything is. everytime i declutter one area, another pile of stuff pops up. they are just so used to the clutter, they think its the norm to have things scattered around the kitchen. i need to get them a shelf for the stuff they need easy access to but i dont have a big enough vehicle to fit one and i cant afford a brand new one. any tips ideas on how to manage my situation?
