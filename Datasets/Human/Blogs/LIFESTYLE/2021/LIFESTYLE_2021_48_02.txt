Trying to upgrade my elderly relative on an International United flight from Asia. His fare class is L, in case that matters, and the flight is on June 2. Flight is looking quite empty right now but wondering what the best option is for an upgrade. On the United portal everything is grayed out, so I am assuming I might need to call in. But any advice before calling in would be appreciated. Thanks all.
