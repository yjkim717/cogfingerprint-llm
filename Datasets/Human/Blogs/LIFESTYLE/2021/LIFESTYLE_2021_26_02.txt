Hi, I'm looking for a ThinkPad for student I need it to boot Ubuntu for half a year and then windows the rest. Here are the requirements I'm looking for \- web development \-student work \-light gaming \- price range: 1100 CAD to 1300 CAD \- preferably around 14'', one with no numpads \-ubuntu \-look clean and sleek also I see intel and amd variations of the same model priced differently, why? any input is appreciated, thanks!
