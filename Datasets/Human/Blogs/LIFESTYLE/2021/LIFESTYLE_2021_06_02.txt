Reviews said the Pixel 6 Pro takes a moment to process camera shots. Having owned a few Pixels I knew to expect this. But the Pixel 6 Pro .............. Woah. Instead of an expected 3-5 seconds this phone takes 20-30 seconds. Especially the case with night or low light shots. I'm now curious if this is a defective unit or just the norm. Is this photo processing wait the same experience for other owners?
