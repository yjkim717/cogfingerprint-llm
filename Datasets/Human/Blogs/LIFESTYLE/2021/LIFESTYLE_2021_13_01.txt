She is on antibiotics, I've been trying to keep her still but she loves to zoom. She had the surgery 10 days ago and is behaving normally. The lump is hard to the touch and about the size of a walnut. About 5 days after the surgery my kitten's belly went red and there was generalised swelling. I went back to the vet and they said it was a reaction to the stitches and gave me (for her) antibiotics to reduce the chance of infection given the amount of swelling. Since the antibiotics, the swelling has subsided but this new lump developed yesterday and has grown in size over the course of today. I've emailed my vet but I won't get a response until tomorrow so I am anxious to know more information Thumb for scale close up of the wound
