Title. I live in between midtown and buckhead and so far there’s only 1 starbucks where it has a really bad review. I’m looking for other option just in case the starbuck’s location doesn’t provide good wifi/atmosphere etc. EDit: chatahoochee is still my favorite. BUT found cultivate at howell mill has fast wifi and the ambience is really nice. Just dont go there during brunch time. Haven’t tried the rest cause they’re mostly closed during covid. Edit 2: back with other coffee shops i have tried: 1. Academy coffee is closed because of covid but the place is super cute nonetheless. 2. San francisco coffee company is crowded and packed when i went there and the wifi sucks. But the drinks were amazing ☕️ 3. Perc have 2 tables to work at but i assume the wifi is great seeing that 4 girls were there for the longest time. 4. Ended up at Wholefoods cause their wifi is phenomenal and if you get the seat near the window, the view is actually pretty okay. Caffee allegro is attached to wholefoods so same same with the wifi. The only downside is that sometimes there are homeless ppl (which im copletely fine with) but they kind of stinks up the area. Other than that, great place to work! Hope this helps for those who are looking for wifi coffee shop in atlanta.
