We bought a house back at the very start of the pandemic. I knew prices have sky rocketed since then, through Zillow and neighbors. Of course I know better than to rely on such anecdotal evidence. Recently however, we decided to refinance and as part of the process we need to get an appraisal done. The appraisal returned a price 40% more than we paid less than a year ago. I was happy, but thought this was a fluke and didn't think much of it. Our broker required a second appraisal due to the size of the loan (or at least that's what I was told), at no cost to us, and that appraisal returned a price 45% higher than what we paid. I contacted my agent who said he could sell it for even higher and the appraisal barely even matters as cash buyers, mainly from CA, are waiving all contingencies in my area. This is all so crazy to me as it hasn't even been a year since we bought. I am so tempted to sell and rent for a little bit, as this would significantly accelerate my FIRE journey. Haven't discussed this with my SO, but has anyone gone through something like this or is considering this in light of the recent real estate boom in the United States?
