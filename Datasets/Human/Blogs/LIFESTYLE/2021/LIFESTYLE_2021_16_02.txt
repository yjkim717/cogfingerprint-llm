Hello, If you had a 150€ guitar and wanted to upgrade to an phenomenal high end guitar, how much would that be efficiency wise? I've heard guitars that cost >1000€ are not really tha different to a 500-800€ one for example, can someone explain me why and at which price this phenomenon starts to occur?
