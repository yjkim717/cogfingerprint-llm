Long time lurker, first time wart remover. I have some questions and would appreciate a little help. To begin: How it started How it's going I've been using Compound W pads for about 2 weeks, scrubbing the bejuses out of this thing with a pumice stone in between changes. Three questions: 1) These friggin pads do *not* stay in place, either on their own, or even when I put a piece of duct tape over them. Inevitably at some point during the day, the pad will shimmy down my foot. So I'm really only getting the salicylic acid exposure while I sleep. What is a better way to get it to stay put? Should I be trying a different acid method all together? 2) As you can see in photo number two linked above, my foot seems to be constructing a fairly heavy callus/thick skin around the wart. No amount of scrubbing will break it down. I kind of want to take am exacto knife or razor blade remove the moat of skin around the wart. Recommended or not? 3) The wart looks exactly the same as it did when I began the treatment 2 weeks ago, in terms of the number of black pinpoint things I see. Is this slow progress to be expected? Thanks!!!
