Greetings! I've finished adding an ERCF to my Voron 2.4 but am having some coding issues with my `PRINT_START` G-Code.... The issue being the Purge Line being executed **before** the Filament has been loaded from the ERCF Filament Storage down the Bowden Tube and into the Tool Head/Nozzle. The ERCF Manual ( Page 112 ) *does* mention any purge commands being part of a `PRINT_START` Macro being useless as they'll be executed before the Filament is being loaded but sadly it does not provide a complete a coding example for those unfamiliar with writing their own code ðŸ˜ª **Here's the PRINT\_START G-Code from the Slicer ( SuperSlicer ):** `PRINT_START EXTRUDER_TEMP=[first_layer_temperature] BED_TEMP=[first_layer_bed_temperature]`<- The regular PRINT\_START G-Code I've used before the ERCF. `{if initial_extruder == 0}ERCF_CHANGE_TOOL_STANDALONE TOOL=0{else}ERCF_CHANGE_TOOL_STANDALONE TOOL={initial_extruder}{endif}` <- Necessary ERCF Filament Loading Code - AFTER the regular PRINT\_START G-Code. `BRUSH_TOOL_PURGE LENGTH=80.0 PARKMOVE=0` <- Exemplary PURGE Code AFTER the ERCF Loading Code - No `printer.cfg` macro section example provided what this purge code is referencing. And this would be my non-working `PRINT_START` Macro in my `printer.cfg`: IMAGE OF CODE Basically Line `635-647` need to be executed **after** the Filament Loading Sequence. I tried being a smartass and split the PRINT\_START Macro in two ( and adding a `PRINT_START2` at the end of my Slicer Code ) but Fluidd disagreed with that idea \- Coding isn't my forte ðŸ˜… Anyone having more insight how to add a Purge Code **after** the Filament Loading Sequence? ðŸ¤”
