Hey my first switch pedal just arrived. I have it conected to the foot controller of my Katana 50MK2 but my channels only change when I press the "b" button, between the channels 1 of the bank A and B but I can't seem to change to the channels 2, if I press the "a" button it does nothing. I have both modes in latch mode.
