Hey this is a theoretical SUL gear list for the CDT. I was going to hike the AT last year but I got addicted to drugs so I went to rehab. I’m upping the game this time around and going for the CDT in 2022. **temps**: ~20* **locations**: CDNST **budget**: Details are unimportant but in my addiction I acquired a decent amount of currency. Budget is limitless. Not like I can put that shit in a bank account anyways. **solo?** : Yes. **non-negotiables**: Nothing is non-negotiable **questions**: -I have experience with snow but have no idea what I’ll need on the CDT, experience welcome -Is this setup too crazy? -Could I get away with an ursack on the CDT or would a bear canister be needed? Does a bear canister fit in the sub-nero? **lighterpack**:
