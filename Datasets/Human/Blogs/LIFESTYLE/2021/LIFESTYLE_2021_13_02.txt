I'm not an advanced user but I need my guests to have static IPs on NAT networking. I have tried setting the IPs as static from within my guests but sometimes when the OSes boot I need to disable then enable the guest's network adapter. I have read that you can configure the VMWare DHCP server to assign certain static IPs to specific Mac addresses but I am not sure exactly how to do that in Windows 10
