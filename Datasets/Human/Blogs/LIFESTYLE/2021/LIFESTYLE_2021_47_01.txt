Have you ever wondered where your time goes? We all have only 24 hours in the day, yet some people are more successful than others. Why? Because they know the value of their time. Here are you can see tactics that I found pretty useful to take advantage of your time (to spend it on productive work and high-quality fun time - instead of just scrolling through social media). 1. **Have all your tasks already planned the night before according to the importance and your joy the day before** 2. **Use a calendar (for example Google Calendar) to plan your next day with 30-min blocks of time** 3. **Use a timer while working. It will motivate you to do more and the right stuff instead of procrastinating on websites.** If you're interested in the topic you can read my article about it here: What are your thoughts on that?
