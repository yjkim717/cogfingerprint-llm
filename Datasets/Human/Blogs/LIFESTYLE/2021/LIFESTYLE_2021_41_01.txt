Everyone loves to have their phone out to capture every moment. People don't even get to experience the moment for themselves because they're watching it through their phone, or making sure everything is in frame the whole time. Just like nobody is going to watch your concert footage, nobody is going to watch your fireworks video. You're not even going to rewatch it. Leave your phone in your pocket, and enjoy the moment.
