hi all, i have a very specific request, i have done search and found good ideas but still posting for more. family friend has uncontrolled diabetes, lost his foot and is in a very bad health and financial situation. we are hoping to get him some meal prep/freezer meals. (which one would be better? hes just one person) i know how to do low carb, diabetic friendly meals but i have never had to cook for uncontrolled diabetes. im researching and the internet has alot of information, i am just hoping to get personal recomendations from here. thanks in advance for your help
