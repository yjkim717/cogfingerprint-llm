I am from the US and don't speak a lick of Japanese, but I'm absolutely obsessed with this band. I was curious, what do they usually sing about? I guess some of the songs I really like are: * "potage" * "いない" * "POOL" * "artsick" * "おちゃんせんすぅす" * "爆裂パニエさん" * "アナメイン" No clue what any of them are about! For all I know it could be some crazy racist white supremacy songs (that'd be a twist).
