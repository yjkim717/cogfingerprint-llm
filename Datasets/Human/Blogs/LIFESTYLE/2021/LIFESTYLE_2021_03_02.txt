Hey guys I’m a regular user of the Zpacks Sub-Nero. I have about 30 nights with the pack and I really love it’s simplicity, not even to mention the weight. I’ll probably post a review of it if/when I thru-hike the AT come may. However, I plan on doing a winter hike on the tuscarora trail to and from a friend’s relative’s graduation. I’m planning on taking the sub nero on this trip that should only require about 2 days of food. In other words, between microspikes and showshoes I’m really pushing the limits of the pack. I only have an x-lite and am a cold sleeper so I’m planning on adding a z-lite to my system. Obviously this is going to require a top-strap of some sort. Does anyone have any ifeas as to how to attach such a thing to the pack. I know Zpacks sells one for the nero but I don’t know if it’ll work for the sub nero.
