No one ever asks "What is the benefit of quitting a cocaine addiction?" because the benefit is getting your life back, plus the added wisdom of learning how to overcome an addiction. Quitting your pornfap addiction is the same. The benefit is you get your life back, are really able to live it, and make improvements without this massive obstacle preventing you from going forward Stop looking for 'benefits' and *develop the benefits you want to experience!*
