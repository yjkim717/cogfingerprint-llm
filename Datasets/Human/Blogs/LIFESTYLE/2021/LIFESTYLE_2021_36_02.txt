I switched to this employer in end 2019, They reported that $600 was deposited in HSA for 2019 but nothing was actually deposited into the HSA account. (I figured, it'll show up later since account wasn't even open then). I deposited more money into the HSA post tax to fund it fully and filed an amended return. Now the IRS is asking me to call them. &#x200B; For 2020, they overfunded my HSA by approx $3000 more than the limit. worse, the W2 is off by $300 as one of the deposits never showed up in my account. I read that I have to remove the additional amount or pay penalties. Can my employer do that and send me a corrected W2? Is there a correct way of removing the funds? Should I ask my employer to send me a corrected W2 even if they can't remove the funds
