Hello there, I’m yet another gator looking for swamp buddies. Right now I’m in a 3/2 at Silver Creek Apartments and both of my roommates are graduating so there are two spots open. Rent’s right around $500 each month and there’s a bus stop to campus a short walk away. I’m a sophomore in psychology but I know the plights of EE from my roommates. Overall, I’m pretty tidy and quiet as a roommate but I might jump scare you in the middle of night when I raid the fridge. I like playing video games, reading, swimming, watching horror shows/movies, and can vibe to just about any music. I’m female so I’m hoping to find female roommates but anyone is welcome, especially night owls and fellow procrastinators. PM me if you’re interested! :D
