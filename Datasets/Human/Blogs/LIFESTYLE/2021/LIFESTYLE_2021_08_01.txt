Hi r/dogs! We adopted a puppy last spring (like half the world, it seems), and we're excited about taking him on his first big camping trip. We live in Wisconsin, so dogs in the desert heat is a new situation for us. Much of our trip will be in woodland areas, and we have found a couple of doggie day cares for when we are doing things unsuitable for pup, BUT we want to be prepared for everything. In particular, I'm looking at dog shoes to protect his feet in the heat. I also have some Musher's Secret, and it's advertised as being protective against hot pavement, but I'm leery. What are your thoughts? Any other tips for SW outdoor activity with the dog are totally welcome! He'll be sleeping where we're sleeping, I have a cooling vest to help when we're hiking, we'll keep him hydrated and monitor him closely. To be honest, we're not more in shape than he is, so unless we all get in trouble I don't see us doing anything he can't handle. Thanks!
