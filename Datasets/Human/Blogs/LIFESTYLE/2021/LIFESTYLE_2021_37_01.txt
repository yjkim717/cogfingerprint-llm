It’s hard when you don’t know how to tackle the problem. I am tackling the problem, I think, but I still feel terrible. 31, got a useless degree and lots of debt. Single, work at a coffee shop. I’m trying to make it better, I’ll be going to school again to pursue nursing. I want to have a job that gives me meaning, where I can help. But every day feels so empty. And I’m doing all the good things, trying to eat well, I get outside and ride my bike which I love. I’ve been into a good book. Been drawing a bit more than usual. All this is good but I still feel so detached. I live with my two best friends and I don’t even have the energy to be a good friend right now. I just want to curl up in my room alone and read a book and disappear. Everything just feels pointless. Maybe it’s the recent breakup? I’m sad I don’t have that love in my life I want, but I’m not sure that romance will fix me. Therapy would be great but I can’t find anywhere that accepts my insurance :( Just wanted to put some thoughts into the world. Thought it might be cathartic. I’m trying hard every day, I promise I am.
