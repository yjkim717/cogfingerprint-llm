So I went over to a friend's house, I don't know him super well so we're not very close yet, but we were a couple people in his house. I brought a 6 pack and shared, everyone else did like a usual get together you know... Well I open his fridge to grab another beer at one point during the night and saw he had a 4 pack of Heady Topper near the back, he had just got back from Vermont too (we're in the west coast). I am not super knowledgeable about beer, but I did recognize the can and knew it was a very highly rated beer. I grabbed one and I was like "Oh damn! I hear this beer is amazing right? Can I have one?" And he was like "uh.. yeah sure". Drank the whole thing, it was delicious, thanked him, w/e. Thing is, I later looked it up to see if they sold it near me... and now I see that this beer is apparently the highest rated beer in the US (100 on beer advocate?) And I just see forums of people talking about how long they've been on wait lists to be able to get one of these beers... And how people fly to Vermont from all over the world to snag a 4 pack. Also he's kinda shy, and I am afraid that if he didn't want me to drink one of his prized possession beers he might not have been confident enough to have spoken up and tell me no... I don't know I just feel bad now, after looking it up, this seems to me like the type of beer people save for a long time and drink for a special occasion? And I come in and just drink one with no regard for human life? Idk... I feel kind of bad, should I? What would you do?
