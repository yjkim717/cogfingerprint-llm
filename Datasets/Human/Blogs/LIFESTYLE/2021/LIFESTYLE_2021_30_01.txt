Spoilers below: >!I just did a rewatch the season 2 finale. Right before the final pull away, Sergei does this seeming romantic gesture where he calls Margo and asks if they can meet up at some future conference. I originally watched this without subtitles but on rewatch the military dudes on the other side of Sergei's desk say something pretty ominous: Sergie says "I'm telling you she will not come" to which they reply "It doesn't matter. She already opened the door with Buran. By the time she realizes she is working for us, it will be too late."!< Thoughts how this might play out in S03?
