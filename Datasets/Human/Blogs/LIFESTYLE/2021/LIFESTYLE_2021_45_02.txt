How do people do this with their spouse? Right now we have 2 separate checking accounts and 2 individual credit cards. There's two options i see: 1. open a third cc that i am the primary on and she is an authorized user and is set to be paid from my bank account and she sends me half each month 2. we open a joint bank account and a joint cc and link the cc to that I like option 1 bc it automatically keeps each of us honest about going over budget. Would love to hear thoughts on this from others
