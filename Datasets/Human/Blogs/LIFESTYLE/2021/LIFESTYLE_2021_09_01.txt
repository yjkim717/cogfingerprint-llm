Every year we get various articles and lists of the year's "food trends" - this year supposedly includes plant-based foods and pickling/fermenting. What are the foods, trends, cuisines, flavours and ingredients you're planning to take a bigger focus on this year? For me it's: * fennel seed * coriander seed * lentils * mushrooms * kidney beans * yeasted buns * gojuchang And also more vegetable-centred meals, where meat/fish may be an addition, but not the centre of attention.
