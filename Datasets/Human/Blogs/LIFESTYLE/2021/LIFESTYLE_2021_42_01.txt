The lines at the registers are completely backed into the aisles, then bread and milk are almost empty. Wtf is wrong with people ? I know it’s the first snow of the year but it’s only calling for less than an inch and there’s a high chance that won’t even happen because it’s going to be above freezing and tomorrow it’s supposed to be 60F so even if it does snow a tiny bit it’s immediately going to melt. Are people really this paranoid ? It took me over 20 minutes of my 30 minute break to buy my lunch because there’s just so many people. What do these people think is going to happen ? The possible less than one inch will turn into a blizzard or something ? Damn.
