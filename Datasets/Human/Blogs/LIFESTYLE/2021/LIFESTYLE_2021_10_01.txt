Hello, /r/stopdrinking! Saturday Shares are (supposed to be) back! But I was ghosted again. It's time for a change. I'm going to retire my approach to Saturday Shares. Scheduling a single person, sometimes a month or more out, to volunteer their story isn't working well. I've had as many no-shows as I have had shares in the last couple of months. I was ghosted again last night and next week's share is off the wagon and canceled on me. This is more the norm than the exception. And it makes sense to me. In sobriety my priorities have changed, life's gotten busier, and I'm no stranger to relapse. I imagine many volunteers experience this too. But I just feel like I'm swimming upstream and my approach isn't self-sustaining. I'm done trying to do Saturday Shares my way. If you've noticed, the sidebar instructions _still_ reads: > Our Stories: Saturday Shares > > Saturday Shares are posts where our members share their story. > > Saturday Shares > > If you would like to do a Saturday Share, post your story and message the moderators so they can tag your story appropriately. No permission needed, just do it. It doesn't have to be on a Saturday. Seems like a good system. From here on out, I will make a post each Friday night that gathers links to that week's Saturday Shares. We'll sticky that post on Saturdays. That way, anyone who wants to post a Saturday Share can participate _anytime_ they are ready and anyone who wants to read some Saturday Shares will have a nice tidy post aggregating them all each week. Thank you to all who volunteered your shares. And to any volunteers who didn't get a chance to be featured, I'd encourage you to write and post your share in the coming weeks. Thanks!
