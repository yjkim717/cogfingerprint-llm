I make art and a lot of it centers around butch people. I am in the process of trying to write a screenplay about a central (butch) character who is ‘jumping through time’. Not in a sci fi way, in a way where they bear witness to different periods of time in the USA as a butch person. I have just started researching more seriously because the only historical lesbian focused book I’ve read is Stone Butch Blues. I asked about the experiences of butches in a facebook group and it’s making me really upset. I knew it was bad but I didn’t realize that even up into the 90s it was almost a given you would be physically assaulted at some point if you were visibly queer. I don’t think younger queer people realize how bad it actually was. Stone Butch Blues is incredibly sad but I think reading people’s stories straight from them is hitting extra hard. I don’t know, I have been crying on and off. It’s rough. I have been coming into my own as a butch and while I am reaching a point of self actualization in regards to my gender identity the full weight of it all is emotionally devastating. There is this hidden rarely addressed sadness in this identity.
