Can anyone recommend some of their favorite helpful therapy books for ADHD? I’m really struggling right now. I’d love to see a therapist but there’s nobody around me that accepts my insurance so it’s sadly out of the question for now. I’d love to be able to start bettering myself, because I just feel like a total mess some days Just adding some more words to reach the character maximum. Thanks for your help.
