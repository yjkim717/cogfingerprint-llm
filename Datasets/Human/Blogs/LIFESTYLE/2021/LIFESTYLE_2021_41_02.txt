Downloaded 1 and 2 from Steam, excited to play Terrorist Hunt again with a friend. Come to find out there's an issue with the multiplayer. You can't connect online. It just says "Operation Failed" when you try and login with your uPlay account. There's threads on reddit and Steam saying the servers aren't down, but there's just some error that nobody can figure out how to get around, and ubisoft hasn't address. I know the game is really old. Has anyone had any luck playing these? Does Rainbow Six 3 and/or Lockdown (never played them) work online multi-player?
