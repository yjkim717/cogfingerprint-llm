Seems like today's Saturday Sharer fell through. It's a hectic day for me, so just a quick note: I'm always looking for people to post for the Saturday Share. Info is here: and if it looks like something you're interested in, contact /u/soberingthought and I'll put you on the schedule. Sharing our experiences, struggles, and victories here at /r/stopdrinking is what helps all us Sobernauts. IWNDWYT
