My college is very close to me and I have a car so it doesn’t make sense to double my costs to dorm. But I have like 3 “friends” at school and 2 of which I knew before I went to this college. And I know people say oh covid has made it terrible for everyone, but from friends who go to other schools I know there’s still parties every weekend. I don’t like partying, but I would just like the experience of having people to always hang out with on campus.
