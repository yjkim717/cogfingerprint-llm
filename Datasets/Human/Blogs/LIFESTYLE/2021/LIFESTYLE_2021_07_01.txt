We’re on a weekend trip to Pigeon Forge, and are just getting back into mountain biking. We live in Memphis, and will be driving back on Monday. We would love to stop into a good bike shop along the way. Any recommendations? We’re just doing cross country right now, but we’re already talking about an enduro build, so just looking for some ideas/inspiration for what we might want.
