Looking to change my phone as I've been enjoying my s20+ with the 120hz however I really don't like Samsung ui. I've used one plus 6 before but is it worth going from s20+ to one plus 9. I'm mainly wanting one plus again due to how clean oxygen is and I miss the snapdragon processor vs the one in my Samsung (Exoynos I hate so much). Is there any other stubble changes if I do make the switch back to one plus?
