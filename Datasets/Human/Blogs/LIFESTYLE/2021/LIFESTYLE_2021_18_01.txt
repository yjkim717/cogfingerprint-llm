Several weeks throughout the year I hate myself for many reasons. My failures are overwhelming and I let those influence me. For two years I was lazy and unemployed living off of my wife. I was holding myself and her back. I think we're still paying that off in ways. Nothing was good enough for me to apply to. When I did get off my ass and get interviews I messed them up and I hated myself even more. I've been employed for the last 6 years making decent money and spending almost every moment of spare time I have with our kid. We have another kid on the way. I think back at that time in my life and I feel like I failed my kids before they were born. My wife entered the workforce full time and makes decent money for our area. We both have made our share of poor professional decisions. I love being a dad. But sometimes I look at the kid and my pregnant wife and feel pain. I think back to two years of waisting my youth damaging my marriage in it's first years and I don't know how to proceed. I start comparing myself to my father and brother who are so much more successful than myself. They have stress but that doesn't lead to depression. The way it does for me. For the past week the joy of having another kid has triggered a spiral into depression. I don't know what to do. I've been applying to jobs with better pay. That makes me feel better for a bit, then I don't hear back or I get the flood of rejections. I'm in a bad spiral right now. This happens and it takes me weeks to get out of it. How do I put those years behind me? I want to be the best father and husband I can be.
