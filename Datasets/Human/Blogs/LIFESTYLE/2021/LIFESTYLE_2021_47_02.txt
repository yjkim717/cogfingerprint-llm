**Phoenix** is an old motive that you might have seen in movies, like Harry Potter. It’s a mythological bird that comes from the ashes. It’s reborn after his death. Phoenix is associated with the sun. Do you want to rise above all of your problems, be reborn like a phoenix? If so, you should consider burning down all of the things that are useless about you. Only then you can prevail and rise in your life. And the first step to doing that is actually recognizing that you have flaws. Recognizing that is your ultimate responsibility to get your life in order so that you can grow. It’s not the responsibility nor fault of the government, your colleagues, your wife, your childhood. **It’s YOU.** It's your responsibility to take the action. You are the problem. And you’re the cure at the same time. Taking responsibility for your life will make you reborn. You will be a different person. &#x200B; **What Should You Sacrifice?** I think that you already know what you should sacrifice. If you just ask yourself, the answers would come up automatically. But if you’re still unsure let me suggest to you some areas that I think you should think about. &#x200B; * **Things that drain energy from you.** \- Too many video games \- Toxic people around you \- Bad habits like smoking &#x200B; * **Relax time that is not high quality – like mindlessly watching YT.** Instead, aim for a high-quality fun time, like going out with your friends, some crazy adventures or things you have always wanted to do. &#x200B; * **Things that you spend your time on but are not your priorities.** Saying YES to 1 thing means saying NO to many other things. That’s why it is crucial to prioritize your work and discard all the things that neither are crucial for your work nor give you some pleasure or meaning. &#x200B; * **Things that stay on the way to your goals.** It might be toxic friends, your environment, your city. If something is slowing you down on the path to your goals, then you should consider switching your environment. &#x200B; Here is the link to the rest of the article: What do you think about this idea?
