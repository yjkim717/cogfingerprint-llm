I'm due to get a new mask with my insurance company and I am looking to change from my current one. I am using Philips Nuance Pro gel nasal mask right now and it does not sit on my head nicely. The headgear/straps always end up sliding off. My original mask was the Resmed Airfit N30, and while I absolutely loved how comfortable that nasal pillow was, it is next to impossible to clean so there are always black particles building up within the nasal pillow so I figured it was not a safe one to use over a long period of time. These are the nasal masks I am currently looking into: Resmed Swift FX: &#x200B; Dreamwear Gel Pillow: &#x200B; Philips Dreamwear: &#x200B; Resmed Airfit N20: &#x200B; Although it is not a deal breaker if it does not have it, I really like the idea of the tube attaching at the top of the head because I enjoy being able to sleep on my side which is sometimes difficult if the tube comes from the face. Are there any other nasal pillows/masks that I should be looking at? I'm sure there are more that I missed. I believe I was looking at another nasal pillow similar to the Philips Dreamwear above, I'm thinking it might have been Resmed, but I can't remember. Thanks for your help as always!
