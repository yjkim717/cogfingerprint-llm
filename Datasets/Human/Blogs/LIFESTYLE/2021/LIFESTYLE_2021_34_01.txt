I have a 4 x 6" x 3 mm thick plaque I want to attach to a wooden backer. I've thought of using construction adhesive or 2-part epoxy but was thinking a mechanical attachment may work better. One of the ideas was a hole with a slot in the back to fit a small bolt, go through the wood and put a backer nut. I'm thinking my plaque may be too thin though. The other thought was just put through holes and screw the plaque down, but I'm not a fan of the look. Looking for some other ideas on this one.
