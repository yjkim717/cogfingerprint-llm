I have found cases for the tube only, but need a carrying case to put the OTA and its fork mount together. None of the official Celestron solutions are a fit, and so far the closest I've found to fit this set up has a 0.5 in margin on either end, which would greatly reduce the efficacy of the box. Does anyone have suggestions on where to find cases that fit large forked scopes?
