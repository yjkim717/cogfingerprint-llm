So I’ve never understood the point of drinking or being drunk. I mean what’s the point of making yourself temporarily stupid with a harmful substance just to feel sick afterwards. I’m ranting about this because most of my friends drink and I hate being around them when they are drunk. They turn into completely different people, I have a few friends who are super nice all the time but get super mean when they drink, then they are constantly laughing and falling all over the place what’s the point ? Then they will do something bad and apologize that next day like “sorry I was drunk haha haha” like if drinking makes you act like a dick then why do it? I have this one friend who I don’t talk to anymore because she pulled me into her room and started trying to get me to do stuff with her while taking off her clothes and I had a girlfriend and she had a boyfriend but she tried to fucking rape me because she was drunk. Then she had the fucking audacity to say she didn’t remember doing it. I’ve had multiple people try to fight me over super small things when they were drunk, I’ve had people throw up in my car because i was their designated driver since I don’t drink. I’ll never understand the point of being drunk. Some people say it’s to “escape” but I’ve had a really fucked up life and I don’t need alcohol to escape anything .
