They all look awful. It looks like a child did their hair and it's really unflattering. Is this a trend? Also, why hasn't Chuck stepped up to actually TRY to help his family fight less and try to get along. These people must be making so much money off this show that they just don't care what kind of damage they all leave behind. It's seriously sad.
