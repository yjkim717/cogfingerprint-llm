My daughter was dx a few months ago. She’d been doing kind of ok for a while. Tried Reglan but started having TD. Currently trying to get her on Domperidone but it’s not available in the US from what I understand (or something like that). Her doctor seems to only know enough to diagnose her and start meds, but we’re not getting much guidance on anything else. How the hell do we find a doctor that actually understands GP? My daughter has also been referred to an autonomic clinic, but of course the one nearby just lost their one doctor 3 weeks before her appointment she’d already waited 3 months for. We’re located in western Tennessee, so if anyone knows of a clinic for either autonomic OR GP within a few hours of this area, I’d love some help. I’m usually pretty good at finding info on Google, but I don’t want to end up at another general GI doctor. Thank you!
