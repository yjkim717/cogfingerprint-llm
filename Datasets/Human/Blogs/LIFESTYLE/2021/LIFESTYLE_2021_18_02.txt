So I have a fair amount of bike tools I inherited. I'm not too skilled but I true friends wheels, repack hubs and fix brakes for people. That's about my skill set. My current bike is over 30 years old and I put about 10,000 miles on it. No idea how much the prior owner put on it. Since I have an extra drop bar and brake levers, I thought it would be fun to pick up a 90's MTB and convert it to the gravel bike. I know i know, But my commute is 12 miles over rough road some limestone and potentially 1/4-1/2 mile single track What type of shifters would work best for this conversion? I have 3x7 brake lever shifters potentially coming my way, but I don't think that will work with MTB derailleurs. Are friction bar end shifters my best bet? Alternatively I'm just going to buy a Poseidon X but I'd like to save some money and try one of these builds first.
