Anyone downtown just hear a loud roaring noise that lasted for a minute or two. Sounded like a very low flying aircraft but the sky looked empty. Was it the sound of the Hadnut campaign deflating? Resident LUXURY HOUSING guy had too many tacos last night? Parade of car exhausts racing down devils artery? *Edit: Just saw a pair of fighter aircraft. Unsure what type*
