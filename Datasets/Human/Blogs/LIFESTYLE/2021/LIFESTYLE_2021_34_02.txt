TL;dr; No pedal response while glow plus are on. I have a 2000 F350 (built 99) with the 7.3 of course. No chips. When the glow plugs are on, I have no throttle response from the pedal. As soon as the GPR clicks off I have pedal. If I unhook the glow plug relay I have pedal immediately. WTS light does come on. Service Engine comes on if you push the pedal down until the GPR clicks off. I can't find any blown fuses. I haven't had it cut off while driving. I've had it seem like it lost signal for a split second but couldn't tell if that was just me letting off the pedal and not realizing it. **Here is what I've done:** * Replaced pedal assemble complete with new sensors * Bypassed IVS wire from firewall harness to PCM wire with a direct wire. * Checked fuse #45/19 specifically and all other fuses. * Checked OD wire. Heat shrink was worn but no copper exposed. Liquid taped it and electrical taped over it anyway. * PCM sent off and tested good. Mobile mechanic put his computer on it and said the PCM wasn't seeing the signal. I verified with Forscan I can't connect to truck, but can connect to my other cars so it's not Forscan/OBD2 reader. * Someone said check ICP and has oil in it. Unplugging it doesn't change anything. I cleaned it and within a few seconds after startup had oil in it again. The harness is also loose. You can pull it out almost 1/4" and when holding it while it's running it'll shock you. * Replaced glow plugs and relay because one showed 1000 ohms of resistance while others were 2 or less. Did not fix the problem. * Replaced starter * Replaced battery cross over cable * Had new batteries Looking to see if anyone had a similar issue.
