It doesn’t have to be in any particular language or even have lyrics, but I’m definitely looking for songs with similar upbeat guitar tracks and fast-paced lyrics. I generally want the vibe of skateboarding down a street and grooving to the beat. The closest song I’ve found in vibe is Stuntin’ by The Floozies but it’s almost a little too electronic.
