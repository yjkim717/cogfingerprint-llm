I have a prayer plant in a beautiful clay pot, and over Thanksgiving, it apparently really dried out, and I came home to it looking extremely limp and stressed. I gave it a really good drink of water, and I could see that the dirt had pulled away from the clay pot it was so dry. It got really cold here that weekend, which also means it got dry. I think between the furnace vent being within the same 6 square feet and the dry air, the pot likely pulled whatever moisture was left in the soil. 3 days later, it is still incredibly limp. Most of the leaves have been curled for 2 days. A few leaves seem to be doing their open/close thing, but it is just laying limp on the table. I've watered it (but not too much) in the last couple days to keep the soil very damp. I know they like water. I took a cutting today and put it in a vase, in an effort to possibly start growth on a new section of the plant in case I lose the whole thing. The cutting seemed really healthy. The stem was plump and juicy, so I think it will take, but I'm just confused why it wasn't bouncing back if it still seems so healthy. Is there anything else I can do? Just be patient? Should I cut off leaves that look like they're dying to help concentrate the plant's effort on things that can be saved?
