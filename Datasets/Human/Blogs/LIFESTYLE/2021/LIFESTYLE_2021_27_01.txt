So to start with I actually really love the show. But gosh over successive viewings, the rampant sexism gets SOOOO uncomfortable. For a show that can be so insightful and warm, I just don't understand the showrunners' constant need to regress to shitty, sexist jokes. After a while, Barney gets nauseating to watch.
