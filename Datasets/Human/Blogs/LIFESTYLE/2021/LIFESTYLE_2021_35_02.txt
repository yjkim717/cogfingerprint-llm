So I'm playing franchise mode, and I get a lot of good/good contact, and sometime prefect/prefect contact too. But I'm not getting a hit. Most of my good/good contact is usually caught and my prefect/prefect contact is usually single hit. I'm playing veteran level, is that normal? If that is not normal, which slider I should adjust to get more hit? Also in general, how many hit/run per game is the normal average in franchise mode?
