**Easy mode: No porn...** ***until a 30 to 90-day challenge is completed*** **Hard mode: No porn, no masturbation...** ***until a 30 to 90-day challenge is completed*** **Monk mode: No porn, no masturbation, no sex...** ***until a 30 to 90-day challenge is completed*** --------- **This sub isn't, nor has it ever been, "*Anti-fap*", or "*Forever Nofap*"... or "*no-sex*"** Don't believe me? Read from the sidebar of this page, written by the founders of this sub: >This forum is intended for porn addiction recovery ***and is not an anti-masturbation forum***, many users return to non-compulsive masturbation **after ridding pornography from their sexual habits** Enjoy the *time-limited* challenge of Nofap, and then enjoy your life, without porn
