I thought I had something set up, but it fell through. We're traveling with our little mutt dog, and we have tickets for Meow Wolf Monday. Our hotel allows dogs, but it's not ok to leave him unattended. Does anyone have any recommendations? I've called most of the business I have found - maybe there's a dog walker or someone who can help for a few hours Monday afternoon? I'd be comfortable with someone insured with referrals or an established business, but I'm flexible on location. Thanks for any leads!
