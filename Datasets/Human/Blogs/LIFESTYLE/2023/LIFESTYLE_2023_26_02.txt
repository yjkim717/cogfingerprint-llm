I recently got a perm and I've been using shea moisture curl shampoo and conditioner as well strictly curls curl cream every 2-3 days, the hair looks great (wavy/curly) when it's damp but when I wake up the next morning my hair just looks like messy straight bed hair, it's still a little wavy but it just mostly looks frizzy, I am wondering how I can make my perm seem more revitalized in the morning? Any input is appreciated, thank you!
