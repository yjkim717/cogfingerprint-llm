A little while back I made a post here asking if it was a good time to buy a quest 2. My thinking being that it might be better to wait for a potential quest 3 release. Well I just thought I'd update to say that buying it was in my opinion the right decision. My experience has been extremely typical of many vr headset owners. While being pretty blown away by various aspects of it at the beginning (honestly my favourite thing I've used it for is the first steps demo) I just lost all enthusiasm and don't really enjoy using it. It makes me feel pretty nauseous, which I didn't expect to be such a problem, no game I've played has really hooked me, all in all its just a bit of a novelty, and once that's gone, it's gone. I'll probably keep it, because I do get occasional use out of it, and it's still kinda cool to own, I feel like it would come in more handy if ever ended up with a pc to use it with. But glad I got it nice and cheap and didn't wait for a new one that would presumably be just the same enjoyment wise (quality isn't a huge factor in why I didn't like it) and if anyone else has the same question, I'd encourage them to do the same.
