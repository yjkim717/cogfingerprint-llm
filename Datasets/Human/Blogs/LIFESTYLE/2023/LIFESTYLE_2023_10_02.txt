Hello, fellow Sobernauts! Welcome to 'Tude Talk Tuesday, where you're invited to share what changes you've noticed in your attitudes and perspectives since you've gotten sober. I once heard someone say "I could quit if I wanted to, I just didn't want to" and that resonated with me. Through most of my I drinking, I was _convinced_ that I could stop whenever I wanted to, I just had no reasons to stop and a lot of "reasons" to keep going. Eventually some things occurred in my drinking that made me want to stop and I found that I couldn't. That was terrifying for me. So, how about you? Were you able to stop when you wanted to? Were you able to stay stopped?
