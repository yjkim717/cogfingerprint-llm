Obviously they’re not completely ignorant to the game. I’m just thinking we always talk about how much the game has evolved from back in the day, then evolved even more to a passing league. Offensive and defensive schemes are more complicated than the old days of the NFL. How much of the X’s and O’s of the game do you think Broadway Joe and the like understand. Would he be able to watch tape and identify the various things on both sides of the ball?
