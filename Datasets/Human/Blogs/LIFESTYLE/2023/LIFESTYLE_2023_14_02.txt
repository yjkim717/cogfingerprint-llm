I'll be visiting solo for the first time in the coming months. I'm currently booked at the Westin Puntacana but wanted to see if there were any better options that I should consider. I'd also love some insight about the Westin if anyone has stayed there recently. My main criteria is below. \- I don't drink so all-inclusive doesn't really benefit or appeal to me \- Looking for relaxation and seclusion (not a party hotel) \- Ideally, there will be a spa on the property \- I don't plan to leave the resort so decent restaurants on property is key \- I'd like to be on the beach/ocean \- Bonus if there is somewhere to run outside nearby
