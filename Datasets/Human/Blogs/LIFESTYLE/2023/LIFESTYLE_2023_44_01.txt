I'm a single guy, I don't drink, and I want to use the remaining vacation days I have left from work to go somewhere fun and new rather than staying home and playing video games. **Places I traveled to:** Turkey, Cancun **Length** : **As others pointed out, it's not 6 days, it's 5 days of PTO, put it between two weekends, I get 9 days off** **Budget**: Doesn't matter **Climate** : I don't mind the cold, but I also prefer warmer weather **Interests** : I like food, but I also like seeing vistas. The architecture in Turkey was amazing. I liked seeing the vistas of Greece and the architecture on the fields there, but I'm not sure if that's the only place I want to go. I'm also open to USA cities, but I need a city that is more than just "it has good food and drinks" I need a place where I can do solo stuff for fun **Safety**: I'm not trying to get caught by the cartel. Nor do I wanna get ripped off EDIT: forgot to add Iâ€™m living in east coast USA
