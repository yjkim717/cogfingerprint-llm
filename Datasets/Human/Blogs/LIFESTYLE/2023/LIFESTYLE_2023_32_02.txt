I'm debating whether or not I need to buy the Cloudlifter CL-1 or not. I heard it helps... with gain or something? I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos and I've noticed the Shure SM7B sounds A LOT better than the El Gato: Wave 3 (the mic I'm currently using) but now I'm hearing I might have to buy a Cloudlifter CL-1 to make it sound better? Anyone with a Shure SM7B have any advice? Should I buy the Cloudlifter or just buy the SM7B by itself?
