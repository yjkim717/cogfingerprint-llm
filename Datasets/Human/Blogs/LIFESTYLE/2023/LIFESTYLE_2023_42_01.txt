I’m getting sick of slamming on my brakes and having a mini heart attack when I see one of these drivers on the road. I feel like everyone who buys these purposefully buys them so people will mistake them for police sometimes. Why else would you choose that specific model of SUV in that specific color. There are many other options for SUVs and if your hearts set on getting a ford explorer for some reason then please for fucks sake don’t buy a white or silver one. Like do these drivers realize that they are scaring the shit out of half the people on the road by driving those ?
