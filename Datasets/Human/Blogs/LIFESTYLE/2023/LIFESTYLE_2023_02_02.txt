Bought gloves last winter, but quickly realised that I was unable to get proper grip (despite having grips on the gloves) the second I tried duck diving. Basically seems to be a combination of the material but also the fact they’re so thick I have not able to properly grab my board. Curious what others have found to brave near zero temps where bare hands just aren’t much of an option?
