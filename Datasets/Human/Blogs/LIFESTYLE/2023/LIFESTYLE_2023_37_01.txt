The whole trip was my idea. My brother, sister in law and their three kids live in Texas. Iâ€™m sad because itâ€™s hard for me to have a relationship with the kids. I live with my mom right now while I finish nursing school, despite being 33. So itâ€™s hard to come out here to visit because of school and money. I brought up coming up during Christmas and Iâ€™m half regretting it. I had awful anxiety for days before the trip before I finally realized this was what I was anxious about. My mom always seems to like me less when we travel. I feel like the oddball in the family. I donâ€™t have kids, my brothers family are extremely devout christians, and while theyâ€™re very kind and not judgemental I always worry Iâ€™m going to say the wrong thing to the kids. Got chewed out last year for asking one of them to be nice to the nature while we were on a hike. I havenâ€™t slept. I havenâ€™t been able to be alone. I love the kids but I am just the only person here not a parent and I donâ€™t know how to be. I feel like my mom is going to chew me out for reading a lot while I was here. Iâ€™m just not very social. And ontop of it all my niece is sick with strep and will not cover her mouth when she coughs. And I am the only one who has asked her to do so. Iâ€™m so stressed about it I just need to get out of this house. And then I feel so much guilt ontop of it all because why canâ€™t I just enjoy being with my family? My mom is leaving for Florida soon after we get home and I am desperate to have the house to just me and my cat for a month. I love my mom but sheâ€™s such a hard ass and I am a very soft girl and sometimes that just does not clash well. Happy holidays everyone, hope yours is going better than mine ðŸ˜ž
