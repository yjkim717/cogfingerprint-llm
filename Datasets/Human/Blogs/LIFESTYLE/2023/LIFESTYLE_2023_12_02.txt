Deciding between these two assassin builds. They are both similar but as I am new to the game I can't tell which would be more effective. It looks like the Wow Head guide has been updated within the last couple months and Icy Veins hasn't been for over a year but I'm not sure if that makes a huge difference. Option 1 Option 2 Thanks for the help as always! View Poll
