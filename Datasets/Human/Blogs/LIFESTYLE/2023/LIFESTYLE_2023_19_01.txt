I'm hanging drywall for the first time. I got everything hung, but I want to take down two 4x8 panels on the bottom to change outlet locations. I haven't done any taping yet or anything. When I go to rehang it, I won't use the same screw hole. My plan was to just mud over the old ones. Will that be an issue? Or will it be noticeable over time?
