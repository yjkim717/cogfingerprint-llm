I'm a researcher with a major international magazine, working on an article about stress and its effects on the human body and mind. One of the topics we are covering is childhood/school/occupational stress. We'd love to find a school with a lockdown drill coming up in January to photograph- especially an elementary or middle school. Happy to provide more information. I'm also eager to take any leads- please send me a chat if you have any suggestions. Thank you!
