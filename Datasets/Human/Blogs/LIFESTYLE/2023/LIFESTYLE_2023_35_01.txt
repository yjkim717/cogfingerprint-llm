I usually visit HK once a year and would like to keep a HK number. Currently, I'm looking this this SIM card SmarTone $118 Local Prepaid SIM card. Could someone explain to be how to keep my number on a PrePaid card like this one? how often do I need to top up? Also, could I receive an SMS when I'm not in HK? I live in the US
