Hello! I am hoping some kind HR soul can lead me in the right direction. I am a family member of someone who is having a severe mental health crisis. He is employed by a nonprofit in NY. My relative needs to go in-patient immediately (tomorrow if possible). He has been struggling at work for a while, and his supervisor advised him to take a leave of absence. He agreed, and told the supervisor over the phone on Monday that he would do so effective immediately. The supervisor acknowledged the leave of absence by email and it looked fine. But now HR is saying that the LOA was not official (a verbal or email consent is not adequate) and not approved yet, and that since he has not come to work this week, that constitutes job abandonment. He fears they are trying to fire him (he's probably right). My question for the experts- is he protected under any state or federal medical or employment laws? He is having a health emergency. He does not want to lose the job, which would only make his condition worse. Can you please advise me on what legal protections he might have? Or any questions to consider? I'm in the dark but trying to help from afar. Thank you!
