I am looking for a low power, always on base for my local home server. I would prefer to be able to install Linux and self manage things because I do lots of random extras - like running docker containers, an ssh server, discord bots, etc. I am not doing any transcoding. Originally, I used an Orange Pi with a few hard drives in external USB enclosures, but the drive performance was poor and it's a little annoying to set up software raid on USBs. Plus there were cables everywhere which I just felt pedantic about. I upgraded to a SFF Dell Optiplex, which is great, but it only has 2 sata ports and not enough space for 2 3.5" drives. I have thought about pulling the internals out and zip-tying them into a mini ATX case - but if I am doing that I may as well look at other solutions. I am okay with buying new hardware if it means I have a solution that works. I have considered an off the shelf NAS (like a Synology DS418 or DS420+), but I don't think I will have enough control over it. I don't care for hot swappable drive bays, but I do care about electricity which costs 40c/kW in Australia so running something 24 hours costs $1.50/month per 5w (which, at 30w, starts making a Vultr VPS a compelling alternative - also consider the better upload speeds, redundancy, etc) It would be crazy cool if there was an ARM based SBC that took an ATX power supply as input, had 4+ sata ports and had access to the latest Linux distros - but I haven't found anything like that yet. I would also be cool with something like an NUC zip tied into an mini ATX case with an ATX PSU - but I don't think they have that many sata ports Any suggestions?
