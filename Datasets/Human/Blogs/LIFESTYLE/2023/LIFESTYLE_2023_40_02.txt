Porn has brainwashed you. It's literally brainwashing. That brainwashing needs to be undone. This requires information about *reality in contrast to the fictions porn teaches us*. Everything you think of a 'normal' or 'high' libido was taught to you by porn. You NEVER had a high libido, you are a pornfap addict. "Oh, I have a high libido" is your excuse to fap. The real problem is that porn took the *specialness* away from being aroused and taught you to think falsely that it's normal to be aroused all the time... and that's not biologically true. Being aroused in real life, out in public, is pretty uncommon - it happens when you're *interacting* with someone you find attractive - and it's good that it's uncommon ***because that's what makes it special when it happens.*** Endless streaming internet porn has warped you: It trains you to compare your dick to other dicks, to think about *dick-performance*, about non-stop fapping, about SIZE, until your whole personality is defined by your dick, if it's enough, and whether you have an erection or not. A normal man doesn't think about his dick contstantly (almost not at all, actually), or examine his 'erection quality' or even worry about his sexual performance. Some days sex is short (and intense, or not, and that's fine) sometimes it's long (and intense, or not and that's fine too).... or he is single... and getting on with his day, his activities, his job, his studies... and socializing... living life without his dick at the centre of his thinking... *can you imagine not thinking about your dick all the time???* Everything you think of as 'successful' sex was taught to you by porn: If porn trains that only massive cocks and 30 minutes of pounding will give emotional and physical satisfaction to a woman, then I would spend every day feeling bad I can't do that... *but I don't, because it's bullshit.* Porn has built this up to be something it isnt. IT ISN'T A PERFORMANCE, THE GIRL DOESNT CARE ABOUT THAT. SHE LIKES...**YOU**, understand? She will not stop liking YOU if your penis isn't porn-star big, or if you don't last 30 minutes... *but slow down there buddy, we're not even there yet!* Enjoy her company! Ever heard of kissing? If it feels like that's the mood (believe me she will let you know if she wants to be kissed... by being close, looking in your eyes, making you feel listened to and appreciated) then enjoy that... and maybe more, and more... and cuddles! AND ... talking! And laughter... Porn never has the conversations in it, does it? or the cuddles... or the AFTER... DUDE, a girl just wants to feel liked as a person THE SAME AS YOU! Unlike what porn trains you to think, if you cum in 10 seconds that's totally ok and funny and it shows her you like her and find her attractive... laugh, it IS funny (because you're not being graded on your sex performance)... and then cuddle and maybe in 20 minutes or so, with each other's help... YOU CAN GO AGAIN AND LAST LONGER! There is no 'failure' here unless you *think* there is, but there isn't. ...or maybe you'll be so nervous you can't get it up at all! That's slightly less funny, but very understandable for someone suffering under the *invented burden* of 'performance anxiety'. Just be honest with her if this happens. Don't try and 'perform' for anybody :) EVERYTHING PORN TEACHES YOU ABOUT SEX, REALITY, RELATIONSHIPS, WOMEN, 'MANLINESS', YOUR OWN BODY...IS WRONG. CONTEMPLATE THAT AND LET IT GO another way of knowing that you don't need to worry about how to be 'successful' during sex... is that HUMANS HAVE BEEN HAVING SUCCESSFUL, PLEASURABLE SEX FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS WITHOUT ANY 'PLANNING' OR 'RESEARCH' AT ALL. You don't need to think about 'how to do sex'... *all you need to do is be appreciative of the person you're with and be playful.* When you were a child and playing ball with a friend... did you need to 'research' how to do that? **No. You just had fun and were creative with whatever happens.** Sex is exactly like that: playful, fun and without judgement.
