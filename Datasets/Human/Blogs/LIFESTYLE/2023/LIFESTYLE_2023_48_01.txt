Hey all, we are a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids under 12 visiting your fine city for 3 days in December. Never been before, so was just going to visit the usual main attractions like Red fort, Jama Masjid etc. Iâ€™d like to keep our budget at $300 per night tops and not spend too much tine in traffic preferably. Might hire a driver and a car to drive us around but not opposed to taking the Metro, which I hear is fantastic. What hotel would you recommend for us?
