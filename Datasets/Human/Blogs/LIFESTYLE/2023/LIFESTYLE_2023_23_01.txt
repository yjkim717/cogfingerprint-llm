Hello there! I’m Abs (22, any pronouns) and I’m looking to join my third campaign of DnD. I started playing last fall through a friend, got vibe-checked by the group with a oneshot, and was immediately invited to join the two campaigns they had. So while I’m currently playing two campaigns offline, I still have an insatiable desire to play and learn more! As a player, I have a good grasp of most mechanics and limitations, but sometimes need clarification on things. My experiences have been entirely offline, so I’ll be figuring out the online stuff along the way (I’m a quick learner). The oneshot and campaigns are 5e with some homebrew, so I’m most familiar with that, but I’m also open to learning other systems. My favorite part of playing is interacting with the group, in or out of combat and in or out of character. Expect memes (specifically Vine/music references), tomfoolery, and many puns—as appropriate of course. I also love to make characters that mesh with and expand the world’s lore as much as possible and help guide the party to new places. I’m looking to play with people who are 18+, LGBTQ+ friendly, and are willing to embrace utter chaos. Preferably progressive and left-leaning, just so we’re all likeminded people. Fellow gamers and/or people who want to live in the middle of the woods away from society match my vibe very well. That being said, my availability is flexible. Monday, Wednesday, or Friday evening/night sessions are my preference, and any time after 6pm EST works. I already stay up until 2am EST every night so I’m open to campaigns in CST/MST/PST too! *Tuesdays and Thursdays are off-limits because of the other campaigns.* If I seem like a good fit for your group and campaign, DM me!
