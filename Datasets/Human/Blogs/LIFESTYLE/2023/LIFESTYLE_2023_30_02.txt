I am a newbie, bought a DJI Mini 3 Pro a few months ago and like a dummy got it stuck in a tree on my 4th flight. In my defense, I watched 4 youtube instructional videos, practiced in a clear field and generally felt comfortable with the basics. I was flying it with all the obstacle avoidance turned on to brake, no wind. TBH I'm not sure how it flew into the tree but I was watching the remote when it happened. For some reason I immediately sort of panicked, scrambled to locate a pair of binoculars where I laid eyes on it, maybe 25-30 feet up. No way I'd feel comfortable trying to climb up even if I had a ladder long enough. The best I could do before the sun went down was to tie a rock onto the end of a long piece of rope and try and hurl it up around the branch to shake it out. Tried for 2 hours, didn't get remotely close, and nearly hit myself with the rock a bunch of all times. It occurred to me, suppose I am able to shake it loose, it's gonna take quite the tumble down to the ground and incur additional damage. So is there even a point in trying to shake a drone down unless you can repair them? I got DJI Care Refresh, so I'm not too worried about a replacement. But it would sure be nice to get the original back cus it is juuuuust out of reach.
