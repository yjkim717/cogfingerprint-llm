Hi there! I’m looking to get a new pair of headphones and would love suggestions. The ones I have now are JBL live. They’re getting a bit old and they hurt my head when I wear them too long. I am super casual, I’m not an audiophile or anything, I just like music and podcasts. Like to wear them when I bike and walk and cook. Important features: Comfort is huge. I really want to find a pair that doesn’t hurt my head Need to be wireless and portable Preferably a little stylish? That’s not huge but I was looking at some suggested headphones on other threads and a lot of them were kinda gaudy I suppose? I’d like something with a simple sort of design if possible. Budget: preferably not more than $150. I don’t need anything super fancy. May be willing to spend more if I really need to. I do want something that will last.
