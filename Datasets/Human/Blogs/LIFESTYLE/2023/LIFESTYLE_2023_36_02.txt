I've looked at every single motherboard and none of them support SATA M.2 SSDs So, it has to be the chipset that dropped support. Very frustrating cause I have multiple high capacity M.2 SATA SSDs and was looking to get AM5 but the high cost plus no support for M.2 SATA has me leaning Intel I have a mini ITX motherboard so no add on cards etc
