I’m watching the superbowl and in the pre game show they brought up that Nick Sirianni, the head coach of the Philadelphia eagles, plays the national anthem before the season starts and visualizes himself on the sideline in the super. They mentioned that now obviously that has come true. While to most people they probably just see this as a way to visualize your goals, but as a Neville fan I can’t help but see the manifestation aspect of this. Additionally, how we can take from this to improve your manifestations. He said he listens to the national anthem, so maybe if you’re someone who struggles hearing things in your imagination acts simply visualize them while listening to something (a song you’d want played at your wedding for example).
