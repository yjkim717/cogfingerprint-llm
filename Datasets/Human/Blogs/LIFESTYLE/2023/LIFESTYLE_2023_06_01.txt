I've always cooked by chicken by placing it above the water on the metal trivet, then going by the school of 'can't over cook chicken' and doing about 12-14 minutes per lb. Discussing this recently I got a mortified response that I'm destroying my breasts and I would be better off ditching the trivet and submerging the chicken for 8-10 minutes followed by quick release (for fresh non frozen). Which school of cooking is best for fall apart tender chicken?
