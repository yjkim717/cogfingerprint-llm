I grew up surfing, had a relatively bad accident when I was like 12. Leash ripped, lost my board, kept getting slammed until my friend’s dad helped me out. Long story short, I avoided surfing for a long time. Now, 15 years later, I want to get back into it. I love the ocean, I live close by, I’m a diver/spearfisherman and have no issues with the ocean, but I struggle to get back into surfing for some reason. I’m a good skater and snowboarder, but surfing stumps me lol. I’m comfortable enough on the board, I can paddle well. I can wake surf on lakes, I can ride white wash, but I can not for the life of me drop in on a wave properly. All in all I need some help with: a) some resource(videos or whatever) on when/how to drop in properly. b) picking a good day/place to surf, easy wave size, etc. I’m in Huntington which is good and dandy, but I don’t yet feel confident enough to compete for waves, hoping to scope out some spots that are a little more deserted, even if the waves are a bit worse. I just need to find a starting point
