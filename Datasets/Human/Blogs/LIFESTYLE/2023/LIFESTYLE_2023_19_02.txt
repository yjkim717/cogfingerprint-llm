I have a Kreg 520 and two 1x12 boards that I need to screw together. The boards will be in an L shape. My understanding is that it's best for the pocket holes to be drilled in this direction: as it makes it stronger. However, doing it in the opposite direction ( would allow me to better hide the holes. Some say it doesn't matter much. Curious to know if that is actually true.
