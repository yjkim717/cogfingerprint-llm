I'm looking for very simple projects to do with my 5.5 year old kiddo. She loves going on hikes with me and bringing home as much sea glass as possible. We have quite enough to fill a 3 gallon bucket and it's currently sorted by color. I'm looking for minimal tools and simplicity. If they turn out halfway decent she wants to add some product to her summer plant stand.
