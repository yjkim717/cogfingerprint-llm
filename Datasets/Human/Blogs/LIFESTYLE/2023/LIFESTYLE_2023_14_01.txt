I have been tasked to plan a dinner for some of our staff and clients in the coming months. I need to find a restaurant a short Uber/taxi ride from the convention center that can accommodate a group of 25 people. A private room would be ideal. We generally try to find someplace super local that has a unique/funky vibe. We aren't looking for a traditional steakhouse sort of place, and definitely no chains. Since it's a large group, we would like the cuisine to be accessible to all. I hope that makes sense. Thanks for any and all recommendations!
