We have several wall vents in our home, where the hot or cold air is pushed into the rooms. They are ornate and pretty (the house is 115+ years old), but super inconvenient for furniture placement. One in the dining room is in the middle of a 10' wall, so you can't really center anything on the wall without putting it in front of it. Similarly, there is one in our entryway, in the perfect place for a small storage piece to collect hats, gloves, and shoes, but it is 3' from the corner, when most furniture I look at is 4' long. The vents are roughly 10x10. There isn't a hard "blow" that comes out of these because they are so big. It's like.. if you open your mouth wide and exhale slowly. Oh, and they're also about 2' up on the wall. So most furniture with "feet" won't raise whatever cabinet high enough to clear the openings. Is leaving a few inches in front of it ok? Will I have heating and cooling issues if I only leave a few inches? Do I just need to look at re-positioning the vents?
