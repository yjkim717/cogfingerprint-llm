Finally caved into the constant advertising by bliss club on my insta feed and bought their tights and I have to say I am SOO disappointed. There’s no denying the fit is nice, but my panty line is so visible. If you’re literally charging 1.8x the price of regular decathlon tights, the panty line coverage should be better. But it’s not!! Decathlon actually has better coverage. Soo tired of these start ups flush with investor money selling us disappointing clothes for a big premium. I keep seeing Bummer ads for bralettes and I just BET they do nothing to address nipple coverage.
