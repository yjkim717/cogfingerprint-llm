I was scrolling twitter earlier, clicked on a trending hashtag about the Samsung S23 and came an across an account promoting ISIS and posting their propaganda videos for all to see. I clicked on their account to see multiple videos, which contained some pretty gnarly stuff in nature. Obviously, like any sane person would, I want to report the account for promoting terrorism. However, there doesn't seem to be an option for that when trying to report the account. So, how would I go about reporting this account?
