Yesterday whilst I was with my friends, we all decided to smoke. I shared 2 spliffs with them and I ended up taking 8 hits. I don't smoke that often and when I have it's been mild weed or 1/2 hits, but I have done in the past with no issues and I prefer to get high than get drunk. I also have no prior history of mental illness. Anyways, when I was walking back home to the tube I saw leaves on the floor. However, they turned into slugs and I was confused. I also was walking through a relatively nice neighbourhood in Westminster, Central London, but I saw a sign that said Camden and immediately panicked as I thought I was walking through a neighbourhood I shouldn't be and the houses changed for a split second. Afterwards I got home fine and the rest of the high was amazing, but for those 5 minutes I was terrified (I thought I was going to get stabbed and I have a phobia of slugs and snails) So basically, is this normal? Has anyone experienced something like this and if it isn't, should I stay away from weed in the future? Thank you for reading this post and for being helpful in advance :)
