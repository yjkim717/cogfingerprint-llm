Hello, I have always been fascinated by engineering/robotics and now also with AI. I would love the start a business in this area. I know I am very generalizing, but I am not playing with any ideas because I feel like I have no chance. I have been in sales for 2 years and also know programming, but I will never get the knowledge to be competitive in robotics or AI. Do you think there is any way for me in the future or are these areas only for very well technically educated people? Also one more general question, do you feel like the gap for entrepreneurs is decreasing as the knowledge barrier due to technology advancements is increasing?
