Hey friends, I got a question for you on behalf of a Polish friend living in Warsaw. A company located in Kyiv has requested him to visit them for several days to get his assistance about a construction project that they are working on. They already met online several times but a site visit would be much easier. Well, he is a bit concerned about the risks involved but I wanted ask you guys to check how safe Kyiv is to visit these days? Thank you and wishing you the best at your big fight against the MF Putin!
