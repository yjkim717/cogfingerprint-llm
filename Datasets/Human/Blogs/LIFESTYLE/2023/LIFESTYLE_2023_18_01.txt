Our story is not unique. Due to common reasons my brother, sister and I live in very different parts of the United States. We each parent children ranging from 8 to 2 years old. We are all separated by 1 time zone at most. The four girls have a stronger bond than with the two boys so there are some connections but I feel like they are all missing out. I talk to one sibling via video chat 4 or 5 times a week so our kids chat frequently the other sibling is about 1-2 times a month while rarely having the kids interact. I guess I'm looking for ideas to keep the family connected. Unique ideas to give the children shared experiences across vast distances. I miss my hometown. I may move my family back as we still have remaining extended family there but my siblings won't ever go back outside of visits. Are there activities or traditions you do? Thanks in advance.
