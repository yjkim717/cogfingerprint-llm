Hello! I bought a house in April, and ALL of the walls are textured - I think it's what's called "knockdown texture." They are all the same tone of greige also, so super blah. For the small guest half-bath, I want to do something wild and bold. Other than just painting a solid color and hanging art, what kinds of things could I do on the walls? I've seen some good ideas for doing solid lines (though it seems tricky), but what about murals or other techniques? My mom gifted me some framed photography she did of colorful mushrooms - might go with a loose Alice in Wonderland type of theme.
