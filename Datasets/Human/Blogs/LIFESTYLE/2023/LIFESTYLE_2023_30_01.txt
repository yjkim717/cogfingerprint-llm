I initially posted in /r/home but replies were all over the place and someone suggested this might be a more appropriate sub. My SO works from home and spends 90% of the day in one small corner of our house where the office and bathroom are. We have central air with vents to about 1000 ft2 of space in a few other rooms that are not used during the day. It seems like an easy way to save money would be to close the floor vents in the unoccupied rooms so that more/all of the conditioned air goes to the office. We have dual zone and the top floor zone is the one in question. First floor zone doesn't really get used during the day so I set the thermostat to 85C. However google indicates to me this is a terrible idea, eg this site > Your HVAC system is specifically designed for your home’s size and layout, so you are throwing off this delicate balance if you close any vents. This makes the system work overtime to heat or cool the rest of your home and can increase air pressure through your home’s duct system. Over time, this pressure can cause problems in your home. I don't think this page is trying to be alarmist but it mentions "Back pressure can ultimately damage your heat exchanger, resulting in dangerous carbon monoxide leaks". Basically every page says not to close vents with varying degrees of warning. Are these warnings legitimate and if so why are air vents even designed so they can be closed?
