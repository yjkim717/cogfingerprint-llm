I don't have a college degree, but I have a HS diploma. I work in IT as a senior network guy. I have been with my current role for a year now. I do not have issues with my colleagues, and I actually like it here. The issue that I have is the folks at different organizations/programs. Lets call them company A. Company A has been trying to take over our IT operation despite the contract between my program and theirs, which is just cybersecurity, and they are not even good at it. The management on my side couldn't do anything about it due to our government folks think if our ideas are against the company A's plan, we are anti-companyA. We can not be anti-companyA. Company A has been the major headache for my team and clients. Now, I have an opportunity that I think it will bring value to my career, and obviously, company A is not going to be there. The PROs that I could think of if I were to stay at my current role are: - Possibility to continue/finish college - My team is relax - I have enough PTO to take some time-off - My employer boss sees the value I bring to the team and the program The CONs: - Company A - Company A will takeover soon. I just don't know when The PROs at the new role. - Brings value to my career - No company A - The interview went really well. It so well that took them 3-4 hours that I was the guy for the job - I finally get the title of network architech The CONs are: - PTO starts from 0 again - Might delay my school again - Maybe busier than my current role Would it be a good idea to jump to the new role or stay?
