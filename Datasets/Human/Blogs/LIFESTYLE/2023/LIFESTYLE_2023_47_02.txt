Feeling down? Whatever wrong is happening now in your life - treat it like a beginning of a success story. You just don't know it yet. Just like in a movie, when the main character has messed up their life. He ends up changing their circumstances at the end of the movie. So, whatever is happening to you, think that it will pass and you will have a great success story to talk about.
