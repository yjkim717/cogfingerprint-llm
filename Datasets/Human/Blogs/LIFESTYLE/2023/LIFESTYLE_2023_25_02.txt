Had a session today with a client that I did a safety plan with. The conversation turned towards meaning and self-worth and how someone defines these things for themselves. Although I felt the conversation went well at the end I was concerned that this discussion may make their suicidal thoughts worse or contribute to them negatively. How do we have these conversations with clients without worrying about them making their thoughts worse?
