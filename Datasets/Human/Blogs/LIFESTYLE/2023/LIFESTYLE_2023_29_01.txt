Hey ya, I'm currently working by myself at a coffee shop and it gets pretty lonely. Would love to have a chat while I'm working on this UX design project for a design interview. Let's talk about the latest movie you watched, was it good? was it bad? what's your like or dislike? I love kickboxing, tarot cards (designing my own), and just talking shit in general, currently reading the mermaid and the black conchâ€“open to other book recommendations. If you're a UX designer, hit me up! Would love to ask your opinion about my project. Cheers!
