I have two questions if anyone can help please! I was granted 40% with a bunch of stuff deferred because I have missing records. A problem I’ve recognized is that my VA record seems to be mixed with my married and maiden names. Everyone I’ve asked has said my ssn will bring up anything relevant, but a supervisor I talked to today said the name thing might actually be part of the problem. My file with the VA shows my married name, but my decision letter, payments and exams are under my maiden name. Could this name discrepancy be causing a problem with locating records? Has anyone tried calling the installations where you know records are missing from? I’ve already requested my records from the national archives, and my VSO also requested records that came in this morning-which are more than the VA apparently has, depending on who I talk to, but it’s not everything. Specific records I know are not present are all MEPS, all basic training, and all records from in theatre…except a single page. Any unconventional avenues worth trying?
