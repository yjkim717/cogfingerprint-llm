Hello, fellow Sobernauts! Welcome to 'Tude Talk Tuesday, where you're invited to share what changes you've noticed in your attitudes and perspectives since you've gotten sober. I once heard someone say "I'm no longer trying to change my feelings" and that resonated with me. Alcohol used to be my mood enhancer. If I was feeling down, I'd drink to numb out those emotions and "feel better". If I was feeling good, I'd drink to try to enhance that high. No matter how I was feeling, I believed a drink could make it better. I'd love to say that in sobriety I'm no longer trying to change my feelings, but I am. I'm not at all good at sitting with feelings. The difference is that in sobriety, I don't use alcohol to do the changing anymore. Instead I have a litany of healthier options I turn to instead: meditation, exercise, therapy, recovery programs, this subreddit, etc. The effects aren't always as immediate and apparent, but they help immensely and more deeply. So, how about you? How are you approaching your feelings in sobriety?
