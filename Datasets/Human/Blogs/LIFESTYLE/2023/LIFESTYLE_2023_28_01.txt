This came from a DC motor driver that burned out and I have no schematic. I have a cheap tester that identifies this as a capacitor and the capacitance is 530pF, but perhaps a broken diode or zener diode could present that way as well? The only marking is two letters: DE. Dimensions of the housing are 4.3mm x 3.9mm x 1.9mm, which seems to be SMB? What is, or was, this thing? &#x200B; DE
