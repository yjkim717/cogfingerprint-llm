Unable to go to my parent's house this summer to return my winter clothes(as I'm a year round traveling person). Is there any cheap but reliable service that would send the shipment? Clothes would weigh around 10kg.. I checked Delhivery app but price is a bit high :( Update: I took my carton to the post office and he said if the carton fits in their window, then good. Unfortunately, it didn't. Their window size was too small. They didn't allow me to send that carton even after max convincing efforts. However, they did mention that I have to go to the main city post office (that is only one in central city) to send that carton box. I ended up paying 1k to a private consigner. Thank you for your help anyway.
