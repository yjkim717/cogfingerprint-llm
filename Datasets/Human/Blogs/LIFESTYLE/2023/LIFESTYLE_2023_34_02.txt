Have about 2 hours on this GY6. I'm not sure if we're just driving it harder now and it's hitting the governor but when full throttle its sounds like it's popping through the exhaust and almost seems like a misfire. I can slightly let off and it stops but doesn't seem to lose any power. Everything is brand new from electronics to plug. No limiter on the CDI. I can't see the RPM gauge so I'm not sure what the RPM is running at. ** New edit** Checked valves. They were tight on both sides so I adjusted them to about .004. Swapped coil. No change. The popping sound is coming through the breather and itâ€™ll actually backfire and shoot Flame out of the exhaust. Thinking it has a rev limiter on the motor at this point. Video: *** Edit 3 *** Compression shows 100 with throttle closed and 160 with it open fully. Carb looks like fuel is working and what not also. Rode it around at about 2 hours today. It seems like the carb is loading up. If I idle or putt around slowly and then go wide open it really pops bad until it gets up to speed. Then it seems to clear up a lot. It will still pop though at full wide open. Max speed was 20 MPH and max RPM was 5800. I also took the variator cover off and checked for a governor. There is none.
