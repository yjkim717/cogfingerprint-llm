I have multiple cams working in the Wyze app and 2FA is enabled. I add IP cam on the manage cam screen and enter my user and password. Then on the Live view screen I get a prompt to enter a 2FA code but I don't get an email with the code. I even tried logging into the app to generate a code but using that code doesn't work and the 2FA prompt shows up again How do I trigger the email with the code? Edit: Turns out, you can set multiple forms of 2FA. I just added TOTP as secondary auth and used the code that was generated by the authenticator app
