I’m watching one piece for the first time and I’m just about to start the skypea arc. I’ve only heard bad things about this arc from fans on TikTok and through word of mouth. My brother actually dropped the show at skypea and never went back and when I told my friend who’s a really big one piece fan he was like “oh yeah you’re just going to have to power through that arc because it’s too important to skip but it’s terrible”. The arc is very long too and I don’t know if people are exaggerating about how bad it is. I love the show so far but I’m a little worried.
