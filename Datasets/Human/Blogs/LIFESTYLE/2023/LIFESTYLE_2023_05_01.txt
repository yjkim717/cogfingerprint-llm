As the title states, Iâ€™m interested in trying out the log grow method. Iâ€™ve grown oysters and lions mane on smoker wood pellets before with decent success, but I think itâ€™d be an interesting project to have some logs in the yard to somewhat passively produce mushrooms. However, Iâ€™m in a suburban town in California, with little greenery around and Iâ€™m not too sure how/where to source logs for this project. Iâ€™m in OC, CA if anyone happens to be local ðŸ¤™
