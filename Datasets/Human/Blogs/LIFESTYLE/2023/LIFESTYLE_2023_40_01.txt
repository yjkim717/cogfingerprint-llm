The fact you're worrying about 'erections' means you're still thinking about your dick like porn wants you to think about it. Until you realise you've become completely trained by porn to think what you think, your life will continue to be fucked. Endless streaming internet porn has warped you. It trained you to compare your dick to other dicks, to think about *dick-performance*, about non-stop fapping, about SIZE, until your whole personality is defined by your dick, if it's enough, and whether you have an erection or not and how long it lasts. If porn trained that only massive cocks and 30 minutes of pounding would give emotional and physical satisfaction to a woman, then I would spend every day feeling bad I can't do that... but I don't, because it's bullshit. The obsession with the quality of your erect penis *is something porn taught you and it's harming your life!* A normal man doesn't think about his dick, his 'erection quality' or even worry about his sexual performance. Some days sex is short (and intense, or not, and that's fine) sometimes it's long (and intense, or not and that's fine too).... or he is single... and getting on with his day, his activities, his job, his studies... and socializing. Porn built sex up to be something it isnt. **Sex isn't a performance.** The girl doesn't care about that... if she's *with* you it's because she likes *you*, understand? **Your likability is not defined by your normal-sized dick** There are plenty of guys with micro-dicks in healthy, happy relationships. They do AMA's all the time. Unlike what porn trains you to think, if you cum in 10 seconds that's totally ok and funny and it shows her you like her and find her attractive... laugh, it IS funny (because you're not being graded on your sex performance)... and then cuddle and maybe in 20 minutes or so, with each other's help... YOU CAN GO AGAIN AND LAST LONGER! ...or maybe you'll be so nervous you can't get it up at all! That's slightly less funny, but very understandable for someone suffering under the INVENTED BURDEN of 'performance anxiety'. Just be honest with her if this happens... ***and stop trying to 'perform' for anybody.*** Just enjoy being with the person you're with. Do you understand? Another way of knowing that you don't need to worry about how to be 'successful' during sex... is that humans have been having successful, pleasurable sex for hundreds of thousands of years without any 'planning' or 'research' at all! You don't need to think about 'how to do sex', and you don't need to be nervous about sex. *All you need to do is be appreciative of the person you're with and be playful.* When you were a child and played ball with a friend... did you need to 'research' how to do that? **No. You just had fun and were creative with whatever happens.** Sex is exactly like that: playful, fun and without judgement. Worrying about 'your erections' every day is a stupid waste of your time and energy
