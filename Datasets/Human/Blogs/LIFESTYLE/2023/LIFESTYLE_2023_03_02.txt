Obviously all but the most sick of us realize that drug addicts are welcome into our fold. For those of us who used drugs, to the point that it was a major part of our story, how do you talk about it at meetings? Thus far I’ve seen a couple philosophies 1) Just say drinking even if what is being referenced is drugs. Don’t particularly worry about whether drinking doesn’t make sense in context. Just say drinking. “I was up for 7 days straight and in psychosis drinking”. 2) Go to great lengths to make it seem as if you were just drinking. “I took a shot before work” (the shot in question containing methamphetamines). 3) Make a joke out of it. “I was drinking crystal alcohol”. 4) Cut out all details out of principle and still say drinking with maybe a statement saying “Drugs were a major part of my story”. 5) Bold-faced talk about drugs. “I was shooting meth”. I’ve heard a lot of talk one way or the other. Depending on the meeting I’m either 1 or 4. Started out as 5. I always identify as an alcoholic. This is obviously not really important I’m just curious what y’all do.
