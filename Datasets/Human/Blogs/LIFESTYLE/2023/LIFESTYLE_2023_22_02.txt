So for the break pedal there is a white, silver, black, and 2xRed springs to customize the feel. And a bunch of washers and spaces, any advice on what setup to start with? I've read several people swap the spring in the accelerator and clutch, is that something you all recommend necessary from the start? Any advice on what settings to change in the tool and in iRacing or AC? Kind of overwhelmed by how much customization I can do with this thing, compared to the old plastic things I had lol. Any guides or advice would be much appreciated!
