It's the first thing he's loved doing. Our relationship is sometimes challenging, but this - this - was a thing we bonded over. It was a really special moment when we picked it out at my friend's shop, and I got to be the one that connected with him over it. My partner shares a lot of interests, but this was a thing I had. Son is visiting his father overseas, so I ordered a TSA case for his guitar. However, his father got him a guitar to borrow for the duration of his visit so I decided to save the $200 and return the case. I've been super busy at work, so my partner packed up the case to return it. I've already got the refund. I. just. realized. the. guitar. was. in the. fucking. case. I've been sobbing. Son has his first show this summer. And no fucking guitar. Amazon said it could be at least a month before they know IF we can get it back. I'm so devastated, and I can't look at my boyfriend right now. I know he didn't mean it. I know he tried to help. But it's like ... he does so much half-assed, and he just sat there looking at me. He feels terrible, but I'm so upset I think I will scream if he fucking apologizes. I am sick. &#x200B;
