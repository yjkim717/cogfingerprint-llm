Hello, I have studied programming on and off for a long time and also work professionally with video. I would really love to learn about the intersection of these subjects and potentially pursue a career path that focuses on it. I use ffmpeg in my day to day and do freelance web dev type work in my spare time. I didn’t go to college and don’t think I will so getting a CS degree isn’t really an option (at least right now). I am not sure what direction to go in to combine these two skills of mine or how to learn! If anyone works in a video adjacent CS job, what is your job title? How did you learn the skills to get your job? What main languages/tools do you use?
