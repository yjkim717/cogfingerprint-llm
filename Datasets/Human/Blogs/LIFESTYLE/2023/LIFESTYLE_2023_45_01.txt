I need a used car that can comfortably transport my family of 4 for a weekend trip with a 25-30k budget. I'm going to start looking into the following four cars and land on one. Any thoughts on them and how they compare to each other would be much appreciated! Ford Edge Honda Passport Hyundai Santa Fe Kia Sorento
