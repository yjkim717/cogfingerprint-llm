I'm going to Osaka late next month and wondering if people have any suggestions for my upcoming trip. So far my plan includes; Thursday Arrival to Japan (Osaka) at 3pm luggage and baggage + journey to hotel and later Solaniwa Onesen Friday **Universal Japan** (debating to go because the place is closing early that week) Saturday **Osaka** (using the Osaka Amazing pass for Osaka Museum, Osaka Castle + Nishionmaru Gardens, Museum of Housing and Living, Science Museum, Museum of History Nakanoshima River Curies/Tombori River Curies, Osaka Wheel) and if we have time shopping in Denden town Sunday - use the Amazing pass again (still debating) or we will go to Dotombori and Denden Town not sure if many places are open on Sunday hence why I leave it open Monday - **Kyoto** Fushimi Inari shrine, Nishiki Market, Railway Museum, Kiyomizu-dera temple, Gion and Southern Higashiyama, Nanzen-ji Temple, Teramachi Shopping Street. We will probably rent some kimonos so we can take some photos inside of Kyoto Tuesday (still unsure) Wednesday - Trip back to home &#x200B; I'm wondering if I should split Monday into two parts (for Monday and Tuesday) or keep it as it is. &#x200B; Furthermore, is 200,000 yen enough for the week? My parents will be paying for food but attractions like Universal entry ticket/s and Japan amazing pass/sI'll be buying out of my own pocket. Plane and accommodations are already taken care off. Edit 1: fixed the budget from 20k to 200k
