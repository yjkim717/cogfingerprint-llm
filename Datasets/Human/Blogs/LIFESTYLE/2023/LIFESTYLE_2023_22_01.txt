I watched a bunch of videos on how to maximize the use of Genie+ and a-la-carte lightning lane purchases. What kept coming up though is that sometimes there is like a single reservation at a time, and you have to snag it quickly. We are a family of 4, and we are meeting up with friends for this trip and they are a fam of 3. The kids from both fams will want to ride together. Will it be a hassle trying to get on the same ride at the same time? Will it happen that one of us gets the rez and the other party is SOL? Is there a way to combine the app for both of us? Any advice?
