Hello, Sorry this is a long shot. But does anyone know of a documentary about a nun that I am trying to remember? I saw it as a kid on the catholic channel so it must have been made before 2007. All I remember is that it centered around a young girl who was becoming a cloistered nun? For some reason I remember it affecting me and I want to watch it again. If you think itâ€™s too general of a synopsis please give me some recommendations, thanks.
