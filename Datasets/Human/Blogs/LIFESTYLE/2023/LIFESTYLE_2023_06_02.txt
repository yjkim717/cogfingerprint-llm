Bottle was a party gift. Flavored whiskey isn't something I'd normally purchase myself but might have to rethink after polishing off a bit of this. Nose Big surprise here, cookie dough! Scent of warm and moist cookie dough freshly laid out on the tray for baking. Pallette Cookie dough. Hints of chocolate chips and sweetness that I can't quite place (honey?). Sweet cough syrup that's actually tasty but not to the point of being overwhelmingly sweet. Makes a very pleasant sipping snack. Finish More cookie dough. A satisfactory sweetness that lingers and makes the mouth feel warm. Overall No complexity here. Just a nice sweet cookie dough whiskey that doesn't overwhelm. Checked around and can get the bottle for $30 USD, not bad for a tasty nip or a party mixer.
