Our son is being raised trilingual, with English being his local language (living in the US), and two European languages from my wife and I. We’ve read a few books and have settled on the OPOL approach, but had some specific questions, especially for when things will get more advanced at school: 1/ which language to use when helping with his English homework? 2/ which language to use when doing maths? Considering maths is often based on sound repetition, I’m not sure if it’s best to do maths in the OPOL approach or just settle for English to make sure his maths skills stay ahead. 3/ my wife and I do not speak each other’s language. For now it’s fine to understand what we each say to him but as he grows older the vocabulary will likely make it hard if not impossible to have family conversations in another language than English. Is that generally a problem or is that ok as he might already be advanced enough in each language? 4/ what about introducing a fourth language in school, eg Mandarin? Are we starting to mess too much with his head or is it actually good to throw it in the mix while his brain is still able to learn more easily? (Considering we will have limited skills in that language ourselves)
