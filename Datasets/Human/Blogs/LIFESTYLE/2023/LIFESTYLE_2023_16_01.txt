Hello I've been for a long time trying to solve my problem of studying something and then forgetting most of it in 2 days. I've come with this: \-Give a whole section of my teacher's notes to chat gpt and ask it to ask me questions about the text \-Ask chat gpt for answers \-Copy by hand both the question and the answer, also checks if the question is about something actually important and if the answer is complete enough \-Transcribe the questions to anki \-Repeat with next section \-After I have done this with 2-3 sections I start reviewing with anki \-Repeat next day The whole process of rewriting things combined with some spaced repetition is giving some results. The only bad thing is that it can be time consuming and I still don't study 100% of the text, since the questions/answers only revolves about the general concepts and skip some details. Do you guys think this is good long-term strategy? I'm in my final year of computer engineering and all these years I've been failing subjects left and right and barely scraping by (This is gonna be my 7th year for a 4year degree) so I'm trying to fix this problem for once and all
