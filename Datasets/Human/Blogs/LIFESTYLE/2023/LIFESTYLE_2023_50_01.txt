Hello, I am currently in sales, however I have been always fascinated by programming. I have been learning javascript and python on and off for about 2 years, however just now I realized I really want to take my learning seriously and potentially switch careers. What I am concerned, now please dont get me wrong, is the advancement in AI. I know there are a lot of panicky posts regarding this, I read all of them, however I am quite hesitant whether to really get into programming which will possibly be highly automated in a few years.I know current chatGPTs are not that bothersome, however the exponential growth in the capabilities are unimaginable. Since I am already 24, before I get enough experience a lot of stuff will be automated and I wont have the skill set to get into software engineering. I am not trying to say programming will be completely automated, I am just curious whether you think the opportunity of jobs will drastically decrease. I would also be curious whether you think React can be a good source, or whether I should get something more low-level such as C for future. Thank you very much
