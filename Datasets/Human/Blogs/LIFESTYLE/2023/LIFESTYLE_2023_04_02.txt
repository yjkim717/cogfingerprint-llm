EDIT: Please note this is for a ductless mini-split that is meant to heat & cool only a single room or relatively small space. This is not a question about a conventional heating/cooling system. I have a Daikin that was installed by the previous owners - it's around 5 years old. The remote works fine, but we have a tall skinny house. I'm lazy and don't want to go to the 3rd floor to turn the unit on, then go do something else on another floor, and then come back. If I could turn it on from my phone, I'd love it, but it'd be even better if I could put it on a schedule, like my central units, since my work schedule is pretty regular. I found the Cielo Breez and FLAIR Puck smart thermostats. There seem to be a few others out there. Does anyone in internetland have experience with one of these where they could make a recommendation - either what to buy or what not to buy? We are primarily an Android/Google house. I would prefer not to have any cloud dependencies for the thermostat, though, if I'm honest, it wouldn't be a total deal breaker.
