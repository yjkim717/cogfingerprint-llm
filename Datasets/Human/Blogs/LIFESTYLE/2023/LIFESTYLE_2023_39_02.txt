hello!! i had an interview and was hired on the spot, i said i’d get back to them within a week via email. i emailed saying i’d accept the position but got no reply so i called my hiring manager who took my interview. she set up a time for me to be onboarded and said i’d get an email saying congrats and what documents to bring. the call was last thursday and i still haven’t gotten the email, do i call back, email or just show up to onboarding?
