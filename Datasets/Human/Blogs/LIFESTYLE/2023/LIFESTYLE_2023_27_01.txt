Calling out to all social media experts! My boss has given me the task of ‘fixing’ our social media page. For context I work for a newly launched e-commerce app that positions itself as a super app. My boss wants me to build our community but given that we just launched is that a reasonable ask right now? I believe that it is important to build strong brand associations first before you can expect to build a community. Thoughts?
