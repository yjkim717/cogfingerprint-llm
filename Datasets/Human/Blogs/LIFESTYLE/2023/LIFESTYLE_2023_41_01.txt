This game is so damn buggy it’s ridiculous. Trying to actually play the game after 100% and do random crimes and I’ve approached like 10 of them and 9 of them have disappeared when I get within 100-200m. They appear in the direction I’m swinging so it’s not like they’re on the map for a while before I head to them. I’m heading directly over when it pops up. One of them i watched the fire and enemies despawn right as I got to it.
