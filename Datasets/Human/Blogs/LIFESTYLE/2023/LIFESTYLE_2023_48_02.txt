I know it's a broad question but trying to get a perspective from this group. I am looking for 4 tickets (any class) on either ANA or SQ for Dec 9, 10 or 11, 2023 one way from the West Coast to Tokyo. Admittedly I've been looking only a week but trying to see what is the best option. With the Citi to VS 30% bonus, would love to do ANA but there seems to be no availability for 4 tickets. I am only seeing 1 right now. The only one I am seeing consistently is with Krisflyer and am wondering if premium economy is worth it over economy. The price difference one way for SQ11 is 32500 Kris miles per ticket. Any advice for me and would you do SQ premium economy for the price difference? Thank you P.S. SQ premium economy is 73000 miles each and economy is 38000 miles each.
