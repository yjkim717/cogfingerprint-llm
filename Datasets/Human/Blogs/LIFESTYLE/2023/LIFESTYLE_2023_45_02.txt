Had Empire over today to give me a quote for carpeting. The guy said they were the only ones who had a product where they could install over vinyl flooring without damaging the flooring via nailing it down (we want to leave the vinyl there for when we sell our house bc itâ€™s nice). Is it true no other installer can do this? Sorry if very stupid question
