For the purposes of this I've included fighters who have competed in a different weight class to the one they're ranked in (ie. Conor) as well as fighters who will most likely not compete in over a year by the time they return to action (due to injuries, pregnancy etc.). I have however put disclaimers for fighters who've been booked to compete during the year, but saw the fight fall through. My personal belief is a fighter who doesn't compete in over a year should be removed, while champions should have an interim belt created. **HW:** * #9 - Shamil Abdurakhimov (Sept, 2019) * * #13 - Sergei Pavlovich (Oct, 2019) * **LHW** * #1 - Thiago Santos (July 2019) * * #10 - Misha Cirkunov (Sept 2019) **MW** * #3 - Jared Cannonier (Sept 2019) * * #10 - Uriah Hall (Sept 2019) * **WW** * #3 - Leon Edwards (July 2019) * **LW** * #C - Khabib Nurmagomedov (Sept 2019) * * #5 - Conor McGregor (Sept 2018, has fought at WW since) * #9 - Al Iaquinta (Oct 2019) * #12 - Islam Makhachev (Sept 2019) * * #15 - Donald Cerrone (Sept 2019, has fought at WW since) **FW** * #2 - Brian Ortega (Dec 2018) * * #3 - Zabit Magomedsharipov (Oct 2019) * * #5 - Yair Rodriguez (Oct 2019) * * #13 - Ryan Hall (July 2019) * **BW** * #8 - Jimmie Rivera (June 2019, has fought at FW since) **WBW** * #C - Amanda Nunes (Dec 2019, Has fought at WFW since, will surpass a year by the time she returns to the weight class) * #3 - Aspen Ladd (Dec 2019, will surpass a year by the time she returns) * **WFLW** * #10 - Maycee Barber (Jan 2020, will surpass a year by the time she returns) * #11 - Alexis Davis (July 2019) **WSW** * #3 - Tatiana Suarez (June 2019) * #5 - Nina Ansaroff (June 2019) An asterisk indicates a fighter has been booked to compete since they last fought, but saw the fight fall through.
