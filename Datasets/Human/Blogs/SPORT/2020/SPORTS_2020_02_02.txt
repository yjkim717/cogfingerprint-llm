I have a 120lb very clumsy dog that might need surgery on his front paw. I am afraid that unlike some dogs that can just walk around in 3 legs he is going to be useless for a while (he can barely handle walking in all 4 without burning the house down). Any tips for how to get him outside for potty by helping him down the stairs? I am even more concerned about my wife helping him when I am not home. Edit: he is also 8 years old so not in the most athletic stage of his life.
