## Week 12 * Preseason * Week 2 * Week 3 * Week 4 * Week 5 * Week 6 * Week 7 * Week 8 * Weeks 9/10 * Week 11 * Football Version I've been doing a series like this over on /r/CFB for 5 years now, started for College Basketball this year. The post attempts to visualize consistency between voters in the AP Poll in a single image. Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is not a measure of how "good" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on. The individual ballots continue to be about a day delayed from the release of the poll itself. I'll continue to try to post this as promptly as I can, subject to data availability. Wayne Epps was the most consistent voter this week. The top 5 on the season of Jerry Carino, Terry Toohey, Wayne Epps, Sheldon Mickles, and Nick Suss have not changed. Jesse Newell wasn't quite as big an outlier this week as last week, but remains the biggest outlier by far both this week and is building on his season lead. He put Kansas in 1st, the only voter not to give Baylor or Gonzaga the top spot. Seth Davis has moved ahead of Dave Borges as the next biggest outlier, and Jon Wilner and Luke DeCock are still in 4th and 5th.
