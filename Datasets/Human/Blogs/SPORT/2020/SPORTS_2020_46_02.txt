In the 2020 season: * Buccaneers scored 5 points in the third quarter against the Broncos in Week 3. * Colts scored 5 points in the fourth quarter against the Jets in Week 3. * Seahawks scored 5 points in the fourth quarter against the Cardinals in Week 11. * Browns scored 5 points in the third quarter against the Eagles in Week 11. * Vikings scored 5 points in the fourth quarter against the Jaguars in Week 13. Prior to this year, the last regular season game with a five point quarter was the Eagles on October 3, 1949 against the Lions. Though, funnily enough, it happened exactly five times in the playoffs since then.
