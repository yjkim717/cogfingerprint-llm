So I just finished a game and I thought i was doing well healing reviving and stalling as sage. And this is where I ended up on the scoreboard &#x200B; I Think it's really unfortunate that I fragged out more and got killed less than people above me even got more assist. So instead of my mmr greatly increasing it only goes up normal on a game that we stomped on. Does anybody else feel this way? And is there a better solution to measure how well you actually played in a match?
