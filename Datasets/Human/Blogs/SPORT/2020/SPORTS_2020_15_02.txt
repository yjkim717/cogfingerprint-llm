I'm sure that title makes no sense, so some context: One of the ideas that's been floating around in my head for a while is a sort of crazy neo-noir mystery. As I Floridian, I want to set it in Central Florida (namely Orlando) and play around with my state's crazy reputation and folklore and whatnot. A suspect who is a "Florida Man," alligators and lovebugs, clues within weird tourist traps, that kind of thing. Ultimately, I think I've decided I want the central mystery to revolve around a literal cult of people who worship Disney World, poking fun at the real diehard Disney World fans in the area. Of course, it's tongue-in-cheek, and sort of satirical, but I know that any sort of slander against a real life company is a no-go in writing. But could I pull this off? If I separate the Disney Cult from Disney the Corporation and have them work independently, am I further in the clear? Honestly it's just a fun, individual thing for now, but I suppose it's helpful info in case I ever go further with it.
