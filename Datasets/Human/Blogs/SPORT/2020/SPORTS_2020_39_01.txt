I am interested in eventually getting the Alaska Air card(consumer). Wonder if anyone has real data points on score, Credit length, inquires, relationship.... I am not quite there yet I’m sure in my rebuilding process. I have grown my score a lot in the last year, from low 500s to mid 670s right now. I have finally paid down my current cards to all mid teens utilization and can pay them down to 1% if necessary, I paid for delete my one negative last week and have no late pays on my credit profile across all bureaus. My last credit score update had my utilization in the mid 70% and the negative on there. I have a car loan that closed a few years ago with paid on time reporting, one self builder loan from July ‘19 all on time payments, 2 secured cards from October ‘19 all on time payments. I have recently opened a checking account at B of A as well and will be deposit part of my income in that account each month. Just wondering what other experiences with applying for this card have been. thanks!
