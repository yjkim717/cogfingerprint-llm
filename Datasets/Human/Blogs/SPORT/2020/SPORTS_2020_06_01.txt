I get that Dlo didn't fit into the roster much with them already having Curry, but I feel like they could've gotten more for him. They got Wiggins who is arguably a negative asset, he can only score on low efficiency and can't play defense, and 1 first round pick. The Warriors are trying to win now so the first round pick doesn't do much unless they trade it. Jrue Holiday got way more in a trade and Dlo is younger with more potential than Jrue Holiday. Dlo even made the all-star team in 2019.
