Hi, I'm looking to get some pokémon TCG for my son's birthday - he'll be 6. He loves pokémon and has had a few cards from various freebies (e.g. Happy meal etc). I was looking at getting him a deck or tin of cards for his birthday and there seems to be so many different versions (when I was kid it was just the standard kanto version). Does it matter what kind I get him? He knows a fair few outside of the kanto region, but I'd say that is where his expertise is. He'd be over the moon if I was able to get him a gengar or mewtwo set. Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks, J
