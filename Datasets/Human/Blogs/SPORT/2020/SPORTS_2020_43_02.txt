*first paragraph how im against rape and how i know the consequences of it all* Man, stronger pick on the weak, it's the way nature goes. I know it's gross, but these laws that are going up these days are just complicating shit. I get it's precaution and stuff like that, but if you really want to do shit, make the women stronger! I mean, not physically, but they already lack the inspiration for sports, and they usually work around them (not all, but that's the stereotype). If you make their part of PE be self defence against rape, let me see them avoiding that shit.
