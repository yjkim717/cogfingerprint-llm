Firstly i will say i know nothing about cars. I have a 2016 ford fiesta. It broke down the other week shortly after the engine light came on. I got towed to the garage with the tow guy telling me my engine was leaking coolant. I was originally told a core plug had eroded causing the leak, but after replacing the plug it was still leaking. After about a week of tests they finally told me that the cylinder head has a hairline crack in it, and when the engine got hot it was leaking water. I was told it could not be welded and would need to be replaced. I was told he would source a second hand head, test it etc and fit it and it would cost around a grand + vat. That was 10 days ago, i have been patiently waiting for it to be fixed and the phone call telling me to pick it up. The garage phoned today but it wasnt the call i was hoping for. They told me they had been trying to source the specific head i need but cannot find one anywhere in the country. Something to do with it needing a specific casting type? Apparently there’s one abroad but said would be a risk getting one from abroad. So i havnt got a clue what to do - i have a 4 year old car and am being told the specific engine part i need isn’t available. Not in a position financially to get a new car, i could barely afford the repair costs Any advice?
