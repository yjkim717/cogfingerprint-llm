Per the new rules: * [](#l/acc) ACC teams get 1 non-conference game * It "must be played in the home state of the ACC institution" (so GT @ UGA would be okay, or Clemson/UofSC) *** Thus the following away games will not work: * [](#f/bostoncollege) BC @ [](#f/kansas) Kansas * [](#f/floridastate) Florida State @ [](#f/boisestate) Boise State * [](#f/ncstate) NC State @ [](#f/troy) Troy * [](#f/northcarolina) UNC @ [](#f/ucf) UCF * [](#f/pittsburgh) Pitt @ [](#f/marshall) Marshall * [](#f/syracuse) Syracuse @ [](#f/westernmichigan) Western Michigan * [](#f/virginiatech) Virginia Tech @ [](#f/middletennessee) Middle Tennessee * [](#f/wakeforest) Wake Forest @ [](#f/olddominion) Old Dominion *** All 3 CFA Kickoff games in Atlanta cannot work: * [](#f/floridastate) Florida State vs [](#f/westvirginia) West Virginia * [](#f/northcarolina) UNC vs [](#f/auburn) Auburn * [](#f/virginia) Virginia vs [](#f/georgia) Georgia *** Games could be moved to the ACC school for now, if it's even worth keeping. Several G5 just lost their marquee home game. [I'm leaving ND out because that's just complicated; if someone figures it out I can add it in]
