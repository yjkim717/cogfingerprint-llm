Well after last season's tournament got cut short due to corona-chan. College basketball and the Big 12 somehow were able to assemble a schedule for the next season, Although there may not be any fans this year, let's check out our contestants! **BAYLOR BEARS** - Looks like this team is returning most of the core they had from their surprisingly excellent campaign last year, they're ranked #1 in the Big 12 preseason poll and should make it far in March, let's hope Scott Drew doesn't frick it up **IOWA STATE CYCLONES** - You're projected to be not any good this year, maybe even worse this last year. The only thing you could hope for is that the conference tournament stays in Kansas City **KANSAS JAYHAWKS** - After having a potential chance of a national title run ripped from you last year. The Jayhawks are looking to do some unfinished business from last season, May the sports gods have mercy on you **KANSAS STATE WILDCATS** - Last year was terrible for you guys, and this season it may even get worse for you guys. Maybe I can call Ole Miss and see if they still have that loveboat. **OKLAHOMA SOONERS** - Yawn, Oklahoma looking to be another mid-tier team in a power conference this season. Best you could hope for is a bubble **OKLAHOMA STATE COWBOYS** - Hey, Oklahoma State you got a nice new recruit in Cade Cunningham and are projected to be in the tournament! *NCAA HITS OK STATE WITH POSTSEASON BAN FOR THE 2020-21 SEASON* You're fricked Stillwater **TEXAS LONGHORNS** - Texas actually looks semi-decent this year, even with Shaka Smart still at head coach. Especially with their new sexy recruit; Greg Brown. Now you wonder if Shaka becomes the Big 12's Tyronn Lue **TEXAS TECH RED RAIDERS** - Texas Tech looks to be as strong as ever with guys like Mac McClung and Wichita State transfer Jamarius Burton. Let's just see if Chris Beard can figure out this whole clock management thing **TCU HORNED FROGS** - Step right up, Fort Worthites! It's another round of Jamie Dixon and his merry band of you're fricked, projected to be at the bottom of the conference once again! **WEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAINEERS** - West Virginia seems to be assembling a squad very similar to last year's which means just "good enough" to sneak into March. Although they usually shine in the conference tourney. Now it's time for my picks for the regular season and conference tournament champion Kansas and Texas Tech will share the regular season title, and West Virginia will finally win a conference tourney trophy.
