Hi guys, I am an international student who have been to NUS for exchange for a semester previously. I'm going to graduate very soon and start to look for some masters. Currently, I'm quite interested in three masters offered in NUS: &#x200B; Master of Arts (by research) - CNM Master of Arts in Language Studies Master of Arts in English Language and Linguistics &#x200B; I would like to know your experience taking these masters or any characteristics that this master possesses, so I would be grateful if anyone currently studying these masters (or graduates) could share some views and opinions with me. Other general advice for an international student taking masters in NUS is also welcomed. Really appreciate that and thank you!
