In his games as a starter last year he averaged 22 and 9 on 56% shooting and 41% from three, and he is still only 25 so he has a lot of time for improvement. With the way he was playing it looks like he could be an all-star or at least a very good player, yet he's only making 13 million a year which is the same as Kyle Kuzma. He is making way less than Fultz and Kennard, 2 players which I think he is clearly better than. Christian Wood shoots way better than Fultz despite being a center. Rockets got a steal imo, too bad Harden will probably get traded soon.
