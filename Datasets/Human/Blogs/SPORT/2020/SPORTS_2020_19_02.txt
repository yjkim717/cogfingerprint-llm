Hey gang, I am super excited to announce an **AMA with Mountain Evan Chang from Carets**! Please join in as we host him in /r/BarefootRunning on **Thursday, November 12 @ 1pm Pacific (4pm Eastern)** Mountain Evan Chang is the Founder and Head of Design for Carets. He began designing Carets in 2010, when he was working as a CPA in corporate accounting. He is now developing barefoot women's dress shoes, sneakers, and work boots. He experiences mixed feelings every time a barefooter comments that his shoes are “not barefoot.” It’s great that the optical illusions he designed on Carets worked as intended, but he wonders how many people never bother to explore past the first impression. Mountain did the LA Marathon barefoot, as well as 2 out of 3 of his Spartan Race Trifecta. He was a state champion and record holder with USA Powerlifting. He loves to dance. If you're not familiar with Mountain and Carets, check out their website for more info. Come prepared with your questions this Thursday as we chat with Mountian!
