Looking at our roster going forward I see we have an excess of RHD (a rarity in today's game) and a shortage of LHD. We go into next season with Lindgren as the only LHD I feel confident in. We have Smith and Staal on the final year of their contracts. Hajek and Rykov are in the system but there's reasons to question them being top level NHL defensemen. Miller is a talented LHD prospect currently at Wisconsin and is probably a year or two away from the NHL. Meanwhile we have Trouba, Fox, DeAngelo on the NHL roster and Lundkvist in the system. Gotta wonder if we look to move some of our prospect depth plus a RHD for a top four LHD. Thoughts?
