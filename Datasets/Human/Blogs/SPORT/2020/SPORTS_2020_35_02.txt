###**Last week, on Photo Friday:** /u/zaphod_85 grabbed the top up spot. > Had some nice mustachecicles this morning after a brisk 8 miles in sub-zero windchill /u/Percinho grabbed the first runner up spot. > It's Valentine's Day and I found this appropriately shaped tree on my run this morning as the sun was rising. /u/tunicaintima grabbed the second runner up spot. > Running in San Juan. It was a pretty hot day but the sea breeze made up for it. ###**Rules of the Road** * Post your running photos of any kind! Beautiful running route? Post it! Race photo look great? Post it! Eastern time = early post for Pacific time! Nobody really reads this! Basically if it is running related you can post it. * Next Friday I will take the top photos and give them special attention.
