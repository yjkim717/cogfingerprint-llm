This is just a memo from current-me to past-me. I'm sure the rest of you have been realistic about what the end of the third trimester was like, but I didn't really come to terms with it until a couple weeks ago (currently 38 weeks and 2 days). I thought "surely I can just hold in the urge to pee like I have for my entire life?" and "If I do accidentally pee, I'll absolutely know when it happens." Well past-me: no and no! I can hold my urges all I want but with baby literally punching and pushing on my bladder 24/7 it is just gonna come out, whether I hold it or not. And no, I don't even feel when it happens. At first I thought "Oh this must be amniotic fluid!" trying to save a little dignity. It ain't. Listen, past me: no one has to know if you're wearing the world's largest pads or even Depends. Your doctor is going to be too polite to suggest "you peed yourself", but if you can come to terms with it, it will probably save you a lot of anxiety. \* \*obvious disclaimer, if you think your water broke then call your doctor! For me these surprise-pees have been maybe 1-2 teaspoons, nothing super gushing.
