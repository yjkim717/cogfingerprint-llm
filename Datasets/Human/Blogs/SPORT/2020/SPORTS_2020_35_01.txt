It's amazing to think that this sub has grown that much. I found this sub about 5.5 years ago and it had around 100,000 subs. It didn't break 200,000 until 2017 so the growth lately has been enormous. If you want to see some cool stats as well as a graph of the sub growth, check out this link for some really interesting data. I also want to thank all the users who go out of their way to help with great and informative posts and the many , many users who take the time to answer tons of questions either in the daily Q&A thread or on individual posts. I especially want to give some recognition to those who take the time to host one of the reoccurring threads each week. ______ Speaking of reoccurring threads, I thought it might me time to refresh some of our threads they seem to be getting less attention this week. Many have been around for a long time and have helped in the past (when the sub was much smaller), but it is probably worth checking on any possible changes. Participation can vary each week so we can't strictly look at comments/upvotes, but a few have caught my attention that may be time to retire (or at least swap with something else for awhile). **Note: I do not want to remove any posts posted by users, only those by Automod.** The ones that seem to have the least participation are: * Weekly Training Thread (Sundays) * Li'l Race Reports Thread (Mondays) * Run Nutrition Tuesday (Tuesdays) * Lurker's Wednesday (Wednesday) Granted, with all the cancellations, the Lil Race Reports has very little content, but that one will come back when races do. The Lurkers thread is also fills a need, but could be swapped out with something else too. I've added in a Social Saturday post to give users a place to promote their social media/services/products since some great running-related posts were getting removed due to Rule 3. I'd like to see if anyone else has any other ideas for new posts. Since the Wednesday Gear thread is very popular, I thought about having a dedicated shoe weekly shoe thread since we have a large amount of shoe posts that usually involve a lot of discussion, just asking for similar shoes to something already worn or a review of one that user is looking at. So, let's hear it. Have any good ideas for some threads? _____ ####And as always, thank you for being a part of this community!!
