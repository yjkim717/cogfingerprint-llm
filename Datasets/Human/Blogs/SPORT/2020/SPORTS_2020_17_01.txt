So, we got the Snoo when our son was 5 weeks. Holy cow it was a LIFE SAVER. He is 5 months now, and rolling over. We still swaddle him and have him strapped in, and my wife still puts both of his arms down in the swaddle. He sleeps from ~8pm-6am every night. The thing we're worried about is we've taken his arms out of the sleep sack, and he wakes up still. His naps that are not in the snoo are only 20-30 minutes. If we put him in the snoo for a nap with motion, he'll be out for an hour. I know we're supposed to stop swaddling when he can roll, but he seems so peaceful and calm with it. Any tips?
