Hi everyone - I've been having a lot of trouble getting my kicks to sound like I want them to. I produce Melodic House music in the style of Tobu, Jim Yosef, Axhello, Alan Walker, etc. And there's a specific type of kick they use that sounds really punchy and clean. A textbook example of the type of kick I'm trying to reproduce is in Axhello's song Revival, the drop starts at about the 46 second mark: Does anyone have advice on how to achieve this type of kick? I've had a lot of trouble finding a sample that sounds like this so I'm sure they use a lot of processing. So what frequency ranges produce that thump/punch sound heard there? Or just any tips on making the kick sound like this? Thanks in advance!
