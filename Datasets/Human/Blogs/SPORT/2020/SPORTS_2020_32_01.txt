Canada's university football (because "college" tends to mean high school up there) has been in a bit of a tizzy this week, as Canada's equivalent of the NCAA decided to cancel the 2020 season, extend eligibility to all players... **except the chunk of players who will turn 25 years old prior to the 2021 season.** Age cap? In a weird quirk, **football is the _only_ university sport in U Sports with an age cap.** Not basketball, not even hockey (granted, most talented players just go straight into amateur ranks). **300 players are affected** across only 27 teams. This is as much due to the fact U Sports lets students have some amateur/minor league ball. This also includes some grad transfers from the United States. When we last left off, the association's interim-CEO, who appears to realize the opinion would be unpopular as soon as it was announced last week: >White said U Sports is not itching for a fight when it comes to this. > > "If it’s challenged and it gets another review, I don’t hate that,” White said. “I would respect the ruling of the court just like I respect the amount of time and study that our board put into this before they made that decision. They did not make it lightly." > I'm not sure if it would go to court, but a team in the small AUS (Atlantic Canada) successfully sued to be in a playoff game a few seasons ago, so all bets are off when it comes to Canadian rules football. **So here's what's happened in the past several days:** The head coach of the University of Alberta, Chris Morris, stepped down as head of both a university football coaches' committee and a technical subcommittee in protest: > "I can't sit on a committee that's designed to guide policy that's going to be completely ignored," Morris told The Canadian Press on Friday. > > "They didn't listen to what we were telling them. We told them the exact opposite to what they did." No coach supports the ruling, and Morris tweeted out an open letter on behalf of the National Football Coaches Association (CUFCA): >As my final act as President of the National Football Coaches Association (CUFCA), I was asked by my peers to write an open letter to the public. The Canadian National Football Coaches Association is appalled by this ruling and will do everything in our power to have it reversed. >Letter This morning (Monday), U Sports released a statement that it is "processing" the feedback they received.
