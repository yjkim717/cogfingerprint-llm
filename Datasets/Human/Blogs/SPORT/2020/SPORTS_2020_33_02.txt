Gloria is in boxes today. I'm not gonna give some impassioned speech about how great she is, cause frankly, she was never my favorite villager. I didn't talk to her all that often, mostly to get DIY's and reactions, and I was pretty glad when Cube asked her to move out so he could move in. BUT, with all that being said, Gloria has been a kind and considerate member of the community, and has done only good since coming to my island. She may be a bit snooty, but she gets along great with other villagers and always keeps her fountain-house immaculate. If that sounds like someone you'd like to have on your island, let me know. Free to a good home!
