We run a shirt shop for a major university in the US. We recently released a shirt that had 2 former basketball players on the team. One of them was from Canada and he has some friends and family asking if we could shop to Canada. This will probably be one of the only times we ever need to sell to Canada. I know in the US, you don’t need to collect sales tax in certain states unless you do so much sales/business in that state. Is that the same with international sales? I would guess we will sell $200 or less to Canada. Do we need to set up our store to collect sales tax/duties or can we just sell tax exempt? I have already figured out the shipping, that wasn’t hard.
