Hello everyone! We know there hasn’t been a Fulmer Cup update this season, but this has been, to put it mildly, an odd offseason. Unfortunately, that update will not be today as no quorum has been met on the offseason’s incidents. However, ratings should be available soon and a proper update will be made. There is a bit of news to report, however. Due to the odd arrangement of the upcoming college football season, we have decided to create a “split” Fulmer Cup season. * Teams playing in the fall: their Fulmer Cup season ended at 9 p.m. on August 29th, when the Austin Peay–Central Arkansas game kicked off. * Teams with postponed seasons: their Fulmer Cup season will continue until a date to be determined, which will depend on if/when games are played As such, there will be two champions in each of the award categories this season. The champion of the first group will be unveiled shortly once the results have been tabulated; the champion of the second group will be unveiled at some point in the future. We hope that you are doing well and staying safe.
