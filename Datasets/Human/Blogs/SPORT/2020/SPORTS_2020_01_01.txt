Hi I'm looking to get my son set up on fortnite and was wondering if he'd be able to switch between playing on the xbox one and the switch. Am I also right in thinking that if I created an account then we could play together either via split screen on xbox or with me on xbox and him on the switch (or vice versa)? Any help, advice is much appreciated. Thanks J
