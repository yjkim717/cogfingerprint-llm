I am looking for the source of a quote. I feel like it is from somewhere animated or childish. I felt like it is from Calvin and Hobbes, but I couldn't find anything. Anyway, the main character has some weird fear of birds and in one scene/page/etc, this child is researching something to the effect of "how to deal with scary birds..." Anyone have any idea where this is coming from or what the source is?
