I once accidentally typed in "amazon/" and hit enter, which took me to an error page. Now, instead of "ama..." autocompleting to amazon.com, it always goes to "amazon/" which is supremely annoying. I don't want to get rid of all of my autocompletes, but I want to get rid of that single one. Is it possible? Thanks.
