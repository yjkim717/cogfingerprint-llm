## Week 15 * Preseason * Week 2 * Week 3 * Week 4 * Week 5 * Week 6 * Week 7 * Week 8 * Week 9 * Week 10 * Week 11 * Week 12 * Week 13 * Week 14 * Basketball Version For the 6th year I'm making a series of posts that attempts to visualize consistency between voters in the AP Poll in a single image. Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is not a measure of how "good" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on. Voters are once again unanimous that Alabama is #1, and nearly unanimous that ND/OSU/CLEM are 2-4, with 2 voters putting Cincinnati ahead of Clemson. Bob Asmussen is the most consistent voter this week, with an identical top 20 to the poll. Top 5 remains unchanged as Ferd Lewis, Norm Wood, Madison Blevins, Steve Virgen, and Trevor Hass. Don Williams is the biggest outlier this week for the 3rd week in a row. Rob Long is still in first on the season, with Jon Wilner moving into 2nd ahead of Sam McKewon, and Don Williams moving into 4th ahead of Nathan Baird.
