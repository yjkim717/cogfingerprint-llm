Posted this at the infamously controversial r\\fitness (I don't know if they get a notification if I mention them so I'm using a backslash) with the intention of searching for physiological signs of a calorie deficit. They took it down and they accused me of violating the rule where I didn't look up their wiki and google the answer to my own question. I did, and I didn't get a good answer, so I was posting. So I **politely** asked why they took it down and mentioned how they mentioned in **their own reply** under the post that they're a "novice/beginner" subreddit, hoping to invoke some level of professionalism in their next reply. Then they messaged me back with a worthless mockery comment, so I replied again saying that just further proves how they are indeed as "beginner" a subreddit as they claimed, since they are too immature to properly run a subreddit. They replied with an old post from me that they also took down (fairly, I guess) because I posted a personal case rather than a general case for their "intellectuals" to discuss. Because individuality doesn't exist and there are no cases that don't fit their model (but that's a rant for another day). They used that post to argue their point as if since I posted a personal case before, anything I say is automatically unvalidated. I messaged back, calling them out on their child-like responses and how they resorted to using an old post to argue for a current point that doesn't even relate. Messaged me back with the "doubt" meme typed out and another low quality meme (the biggest disappointment of them all from the subreddit. Impact font, really? I know they only have one working braincell but that's just sad) and bans me from everything. Can't post, can't message back. I agree that my question might be phrased a little too personally but nope, they don't let me rephrase the question or amend it in any way, just straight up perma bans me and blocks me from messaging the mods. Because that's how you win arguments kids, just revoke others' rights to speak. Conversation between me and them.
