If I want to make something that is bigger than my pegboard, can I just fill the pegboard with the portion of the pattern that fits and then iron it like normal and then put it back on the pegboard, but aligned near the edge, so I can add more perler beads and then iron again? That came out kind of convoluted. Let's say, for example, I had a pegboard that was 1x3, known as positions A, B, and C. But I wanted to make a thing that was four beads long. Could I put a perler bead in spots A, B, and C, then iron it. Then remove the perler beads, which are now melted together, and then stick it back on the pegboard, but putting the bead that was in position C onto position A this time (so two beads are hanging off the edge) and then put the fourth bead in the now-empty position B and iron it to connect it to the rest? Obviously my pegboard is bigger than 1x3, that was just a simplified example.
