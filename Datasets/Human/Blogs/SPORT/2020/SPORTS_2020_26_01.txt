The two Starbucks out west on NW Expressway (I think MacArthur and Rockwell) are both suddenly closed. One has a sign up saying they’ll try to reopen as soon as possible. Anyone have any idea what’s up or how long it might be? Are sales just down? Was there a COVID outbreak in the stores? Supply chain disruption?
