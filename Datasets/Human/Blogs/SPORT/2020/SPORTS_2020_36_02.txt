Like (probably) a ton of us, I'm a first time investor who's poking around the community because of the COVID stock crater. The biggest victims of the virus are airlines, hotels and cruises; almost every stock in these categories have fallen 50%-80% from their typical value. Assuming coronavirus does burn off by the end of the summer, these stocks will probably be nearly back to normal by 2021. What's stopping me from pumping 90% of my net worth into JetBlue or MGM Resorts now and basically guaranteeing I at least double my investment by the end of the year? Is there a catch I'm missing?
