So I had a coming to Jesus moment the other day when I went to buy a new driver. My clubs are 12 years old, and my driver is all bashed up. I went to my local golf shop, and the salesman straight up said, “you’re better off taking the money for a driver and getting some lessons...” So here I am, looking for lessons. My question is I’ve taken a few lessons in the past with video recording. I’m finding in my area I can just get a coach and go to the driving range, and it’s much cheaper (almost $50/hr). What have you found works better?
