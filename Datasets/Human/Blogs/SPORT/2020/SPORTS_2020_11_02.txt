I know Mike is currently finishing his book so is taking his extended break. Does anyone remember if he said the exact time he was coming back? I know he said he would be off the summer and following his Twitter I know he moved out of Paris for the summer to work on his book so he is still going. I was just tying to set a mental push pin to remind myself.
