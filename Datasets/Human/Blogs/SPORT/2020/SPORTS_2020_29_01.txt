Hey guys, I have a Nuu Ana x Nuu Ami leachianus that just turned 1 year old the other day. I love these geckos and I eventually wanted a Yate locale. I was just wondering what the price range is usually for a Yate leachianus like $2k or more? I was thinking of lookin at Leapin Leachies but I haven't asked for a price yet. #
