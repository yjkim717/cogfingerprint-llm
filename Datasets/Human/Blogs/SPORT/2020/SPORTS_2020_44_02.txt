Nature's Remedy added a bunch of their own flower to their menu this week. Some different strains and genetics from what's in most Mass. adult-use shops. Garlic Breath (either Hogsbreath x Chem Dog D BX2 or GMO x Mendo Breath) looks interesting. Other than some GG#4, I hadn't seen any of Nature's Remedy own grow around. Has anyone tried their flower? Opinions?
