LSU is now in possession of the College Football Belt with their 52–24 victory over South Carolina. This is their ninth reign as Belt champions. The Tigers are now 11–8 in recorded Belt games, and the Gamecocks are now 8–9. LSU's next defense of the Belt is an away game next Saturday against Auburn. This will be Auburn’s 21st recorded Belt game and their first since 10/17/20, a 30–22 loss to South Carolina. For those who don't know what the Belt is, it is an unofficial trophy that traces the lineage of the "best" teams going all the way back to the first-ever CFB game. For a more complete description, check out the archived version of the Belt's website (the actual site is no longer active). For a MUCH more comprehensive post on the Belt, check out /u/BleedScarletandBlack 's post on it and The Hatch Ranking’s current website tracking the “Lineal National Championship” (same as the Belt). Disclaimer. I have been compiling information from two sources that are each incomplete: one gives a list of every Belt game played but only back to the 1970s, and the other lists all Belt transfer games but not every Belt game played, so there may be a discrepancy between the number of games played and number of Belt reigns.
