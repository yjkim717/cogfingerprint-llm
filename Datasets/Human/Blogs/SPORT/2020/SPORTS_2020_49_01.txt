According to Tapology Shana Dobson's win over Mariya Agapova is officially the biggest upset in UFC history, surpassing the odds of Rousey vs Holm at UFC 193. While Agapova was a similarly sized favourite (-1400), Dobson was a +950 underdog compared to Holm's +830, meaning the gap between the two was larger. It also surpasses Barber vs Modaferri as the biggest bookmaker upset of 2020 and is the fifth biggest in MMA history, the biggest remaining Sokoudjou (+1250) vs Little Nog (-2000) in 2007.
