You've said your phone number a million times but chances are, the person you're telling it to has never heard it before. Slow down to give them time to write it down so you dont have to repeat it. This especially applies when you're leaving a voicemail for someone. cant tell you how many times someone has left me a minute long voicemail at work and they zoom through their phone number and six digit extension, so have to listen through the whole thing again. Do your fellow man a favor and slow down when sayin your phone number.
