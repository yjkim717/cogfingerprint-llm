As the title says. I've been in Annual Giving for 20 years now and I'm looking to build my skill set. Our institution does NOT have a robust planned giving program so in addition to enhancing my own skills I would hope to have an impact at my current employer. There are a ton of programs and private certifications out there, but I have no idea where to start. Do any of you have experiences that you'd be willing to share? Places to start? I don't mind paying for memberships or courses, but I don't want to toss money into a resume decorator that won't do any good or won't be well-regarded. I'm definitely going to start digging through the resources at CGP. Thanks.
