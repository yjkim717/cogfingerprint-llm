I remember a while back when Bill made some snarky comments regarding SVP not inventing gambling (don’t remember the exact context ATM). It seems like he would be a natural guest with the Russilo connection and with them both being big into sports gambling. I always thought the two of them together (or all three) would be a great episode. I would imagine there’s a reason why they haven’t.
