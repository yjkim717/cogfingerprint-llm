Survivor has brought many of us together and the Winners at War cast contained some of our favorites growing up. From old school players like BR, Ethan, Sandra, Parvati, Yul, and Danni, to new school players like Michele, Natalie, Nick, Kim, Tony, and Sarah. All these players were amazing in their own ways and have such a passion and gratitude forwards Survivor that many other reality tv competition shows don’t have. The Challenge and Big Brother often have trashy casting that are comprised of people who just want to be influencers. Survivor separates itself and has casted FANS of the show. Erik Reichenbach went from a fan on Micronesia to a favorite on Caramoan. Those are the stories we’ve come to love. This is basically just a post about how I’m glad survivor took the time to get to know their casts and has produced some of the most likable people in reality tv.
