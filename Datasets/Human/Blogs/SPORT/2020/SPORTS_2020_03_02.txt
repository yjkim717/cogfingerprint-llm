Happy New Year, /r/NFL! I hope everyone had a great 2019 and that 2020 will be filled with prosperity and happiness. We're in Playoff territory now, with Wild Card weekend coming up. For the regular season, Week 17 gave me a 10-6 result, bringing me to 161-95 out of 256 games (62.89% correct). I would love to hear everyone else's final results if you all want to post them. --- #Saturday, January 4th | Matchup | Time/Network | Winner | Comments | |:-----------|:-:|:------------|:-------------| [](/BUF)Bills @ [](/HOU)Texans|4:35p ET on ABC/ESPN|[](/BUF)Bills|The Bills are a bad matchup for the Texans. They have an edge rush that can chase Deshaun Watson and a cornerback in Tre'Davious White who can contain DeAndre Hopkins. They also have two receivers who can burn the Texans short and deep witih Cole Beasley and John Brown. Josh Allen will be confident making plays with his arm and legs, and he will get help from rested rookie Devin Singletary in the traditional running game. For a second consecutive year, the Texans will lose at home in the playoffs as weak division champions. [](/TEN)Titans @ [](/NE)Patriots|8:15p ET on CBS|[](/NE)Patriots|Closer game than New England would like. Derrick Henry is hard to stop even when teams commit to to him due to the Titans' strong blocking scheme. Stephon Gilmore will work on A.J. Brown all night. Expect Tom Brady to execute his classic short-to-intermediate passing game well and finish those drives in the red zone. The Patriots might give up some chunk plays to Henry and Brown, but they will tighten up to limit most of the damage to field goals. The New England defense also will force a key turnover or two from Tannehill. #Sunday, January 5th | Matchup | Time/Network | Winner | Comments | |:-----------|:-:|:------------|:-------------| [](/MIN)Vikings @ [](/NO)Saints|1:05p ET on FOX|[](/NO)Saints|The Vikings match up poorly with the Saints. New Orleans can stop the run well even with their defensive injuries up front, and the Vikings' offense is predicated on getting Dalvin Cook to help Kirk Cousins open up the passing game. Minnesota also can't stop Michael Thomas and the Saints' receivers anywhere on the field with Drew Brees confidently and accurately spreading the ball. The speed of Alvin Kamara will cause problems for the Vikings' linebackers. Marshon Lattimore will contain Stefon Diggs to make sure there's no Minneapolis Miracle in New Orleans. [](/SEA)Seahawks @ [](/PHI)Eagles|4:40p ET on NBC|[](/SEA)Seahawks|Seattle won a sloppy Week 12 matchup in Philly, on a 58-yard touchdown run by Rashaad Penny. The Seahawks will be without Penny and Chris Carson against a good Eagles power run defense. The Eagles' offense is limited on targets who can make the Seahawks' defense sweat downfield, especially if Zach Ertz can't play. This will come down to which quarterback, Russell Wilson or Carson Wentz, can improvise better to make their typical clutch plays when nothing seems to be there in the fourth quarter. Wilson has a few more reliable weapons, and the Eagles' defense is weak enough for him on the back end. --- Those are my predictions, let's hear yours. Keep it civil and fun. Best of luck! **Update:** 1-3, damn that was brutal. **Previous Prediction Threads:** **1** | **2** | **3** | **4** | **5** | **6** | **7** |**8** | **9** | **10** | **11** | **12** | **13** | **14** | **15** | **16** | **17**
