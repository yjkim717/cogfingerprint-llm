Luka was impressive no doubt, especially on a sprained ankle, but I'm not sure if he was better than Kawhi. Kawhi: 33/10/5 on 64% TS, 2.5 TOs, 2.3 STL Luka: 31/10/9 on 60% TS, 5.2 TOs, 1.2 STL Other things to consider: - While Kawhi wasn't impressive on defense he was better than Luka - Luka's team performed better with him on the bench - Porzingis was injured for the last three games and had a suspect ejection in game 1 - Paul George shat the bed all series except the 40 point blowout in game 5 - Luka had an insane 43/17/13 in game 4 - Kawhi was highly consistent; his lowest scoring game was 29 points
