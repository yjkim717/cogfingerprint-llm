It seems like quite a few people have been looking for older episodes. I have 110 of them saved (especially the older ones) and would be willing to share them if people wanted. The problem is I don't have any file hosting accounts (or real experience doing it) and it is about 11 GB total (about 100MB each) so it is too big for the free ones. (If anyone knows how to share the whole thing easily, I would.) But if there were multiple requests for specific episodes and I have it, I can upload it today. Just let me know. EDIT: Here is a list of the episodes I have.
