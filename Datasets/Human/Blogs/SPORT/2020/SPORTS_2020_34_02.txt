>SEC sources tell me East Division teams with ACC state rivals desperately want to play those ninth ganes. The problem: P5 inventory isn’t there for remaining 10 SEC teams if B12,P12 play 9 conf games, and ACC helps ND fill a schedule. >One possibility: the remaining 10 SEC teams play each other as non-conference games to reach nine games total. But that’s not who SEC is — and leaves possibility of asterisk for SECCG. Tough spot for all involved.
