I’ve been wanting to purchase an Outback and I am finally in the position. I’ve been on the look for a few months now, waiting for the right trim/color and right price. I was pre approved for financing through my bank, Bank of America. I am happy with the rate they are offering and I liked the idea they have relationships with major dealers. It seemed simple that I could come to an agreement on total price of a car at a dealership, give them my pre approval paper work and leave with a car. The dealerships I’ve tried to work with have tried to make my apply for financing, which I thought pre approval would avoid. I do not want to have more credit inquires, I understand they should all register as one eventually but I have seen that not work out. Also I like my bank and want to have my loan with them since I plan on getting other loans with them. is it a requirement that the dealership runs me through their credit check financing? I really want to buy a Subaru but this process is frustrating and Slowly souring me On the brand.
