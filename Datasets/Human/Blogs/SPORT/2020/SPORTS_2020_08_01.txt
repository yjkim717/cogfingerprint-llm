Weird question, I'm aware, but it stands. Through 9 games the Eagles had advanced to a 7-2 record, #1 seed in the NFC, and had beaten the 13-3 49ers. They proceeded to lose every remaining game, including a loss to the 2-13 Bengals, missed the playoffs, and finished fourth in their division. The shit? Does anyone who was watching football back then remember what happened to them? I tried to find it myself, but the most remarkable injury I've been able to find was to an LB who never made a Pro Bowl.
