Can I use a 5-1 tool, taping knife, chisel, or anything to knock down very high spots in a plaster wall prior to doing a skim coat? The plaster is in good shape and not loose. Details - I am trying to fix up a hallway in a very old home. The majority of the home has been previously been remodeled with 1/4 inch drywall over plaster to even the walls except this one hallway. Whoever over the years fixed these walls seemed to just slap plaster or joint compound thick to cover a hole and painted over. Now the wall has several spots that are up to 1/4 inch high (12x12 inch spots) with hard edges meaning they didn’t bother smoothing it out. If I don’t remove some material first I would have to bring the majority of the wall up to 1/4 inch additional thickness to get a smooth finish. Everything I can find regarding skim coating is about adding material but nothing about shaving off some (not already loose).
