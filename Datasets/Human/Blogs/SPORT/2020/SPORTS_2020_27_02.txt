Overall in the 2018 season, the rest of the MLB slashed .250/.332/.411 with a runner on 2nd, and .244/.311/.405 without a runner on 2nd. Edit: as the cheating allegations against the Red Sox apparently concern a system in which a runner wouldâ€™ve had to have been on 2nd base in order to be effective.
