I work in higher ed fundraising, and when the CARES Act was passed basically everyone (including my institution) took Section 2204 to mean that the new above-the-line deduction for charitable giving would be applied as $300 per individual or $600 per couple. (relevant section here.) Yesterday the Joint Committee on taxation released a report indicating that the deduction would be considered per tax-filing unit, which would make it $300 per singles and $300 per couples. (JCT webpage, with automatic download, here.) So my question is this: is this an expected viewpoint? That is to say, even though the internal revenue act and CARES act both specify "individuals," is "individual" usually or always taken to mean "Tax filing unit" as described in the JCT report? We and most other colleges and universities regularly say "we can't offer tax advice," but donors still look to us to have a generally basic understanding of law as it regards deductibility. This is going to throw a lot of colleges for a loop and I'd like for the industry to be able to say, "Yes, we're aware of the the act and the JCT report and here's what we think it says" and be as close to correct as possible. Thanks for the replies.
