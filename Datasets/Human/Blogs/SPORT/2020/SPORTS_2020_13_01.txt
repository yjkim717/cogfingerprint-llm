Just got a voicemail from an older woman in Michigan. She is saying that my cell number is listed as an alternate number for her Verizon account she has had since the early 90s when they were Choice Cellular. She gives her full name(people lookup show that she is a real person) and a few other names/people/events seem to match up with some open records. She says she doesn't know who I am or why my number is an alternate number. In her message she says her husband has died recently and he had a landscaping business that perhaps I was connected with. She says Verizon told her this is a pretty easy fix but doesn't go into detail about what she needs for me or why she needed to call me. She did use my first name in her message but I give it in my voicemail box. She says her previous husband and and son who both passed way were named Michael and maybe God is playing a trick on her. Then says she hopes to hear from me. I did a little googling from the words and phrases she used in the message and couldn't find a thing on if this is a known scam. I have no idea why she would need me to talk to her to remove my number from being an alternate on her Verizon account. I have Verizon and if you are the account owner you can make just about any change all on your own. Maybe if she was legit she was just calling to see who I was? She didn't say how long my number has been associated with her account. I've had this number since 2006ish. I am located in Iowa and never lived in Michigan. Anybody ever hear of anything like this before? I'm assuming if it is a scam they are trying to get access to my Verizon account somehow. There are results for alternate phone number with verizon when you search with Google but seems like it is a little bit more like adding a line. I was thinking it might be like call forwarding. Any ideas?
