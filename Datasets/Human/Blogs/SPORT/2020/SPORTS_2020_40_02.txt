I'm going to test drive a 2018 Sportwagen today. I've already been in one, and am strongly considering buying this one. That said, I've only spent 20 minutes in this car. What are the things people like/dislike about their Sportwagens? The driver's seat felt a little snug, but the handling was fun. I've driven the 1.4, but am looking at a 1.8 today. Any comments would be great!
