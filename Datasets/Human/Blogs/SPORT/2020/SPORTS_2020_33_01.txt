The Packers infamously did not hold a lead at any point in regulation last year against the Lions, despite sweeping the season series. Both years before, in the 2017 and 2018 seasons, the Lions swept the Packers without giving up a lead at any point in the game. The Packers led (and won) in both 2016 matchups, for 24 minutes and 23 seconds on 1/1/17, and for the entire game on 9/25/16. So, in total, over the last 4ish years (After the 9/25/16 matchup), the Packers have led the Lions for roughly 54 of the 480 minutes. They are 4-4-0 in these games. &#x200B; Edit: I tweaked in the title, the Packers led for 30 minutes and 14 seconds today
