Ok, so here's the thing. I bought my first stereo system about 2 years ago. I didn't really know how to connect the cables to the speakers, so instead of putting the cable into the binding post, I put them around them. I know I'm stupid, but I just didn't see those tiny little holes. The speakers still produced sound and apparently, nothing really happened to them. Sometimes, when I moved the carpet, the connection broke and the music stopped. I thought that this was normal, because those speakers are meant to be stationary. Could I potentially have damaged something in my speakers or amps? I know, this question is a bit odd, since I didn't experience any problems yet, but I'm a bit paranoid when it comes to my precious technology. :) PS: The internal fuse blew a few times. But the system was never on at that point and the cables weren't close enough to produce any short circuits. I think it has something to do with my house...
