Oregon has retained possession of the College Football Belt due to their bye week. Oregon’s next defense of the Belt is a home game next Saturday against UCLA. This will be the Bruins’ 53rd Belt game and their first since December 27, 2012, a 49–26 loss to Belt-holder Baylor in the Holiday Bowl. A recap of the Belt’s journey this season: * Week 1: Baylor retains the Belt against Albany * Week 2: Baylor loses the belt to BYU * Week 3: BYU loses the belt to Oregon * Week 4: Oregon retains the Belt against Washington State * Week 5: Oregon retains the Belt against Stanford * Week 6: Oregon retains the Belt against Arizona * Week 7: Oregon retains the Belt due to bye week For those who don't know what the Belt is, it is an unofficial trophy that traces the lineage of the "best" teams going all the way back to the first-ever CFB game.
