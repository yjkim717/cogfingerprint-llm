Hello My son purchased the Star Wars pack via the Minecraft marketplace using his Minecoins. However when we have gone to the 'his content' section to download, it won't download at all. The skin packs are available but not the world/map. I've tried signing out and in, hard reset and uninstalling and reinstalling the game yet no avail. We are on xbox series x. I still need to see if they same issue occurs on his xbox one x but still, I can't understand why it won't download. Any tips/advice is much appreciated. Thanks in advance
