Demon souls, Ds1, Ds2, Ds3, Sekiro, Bloodborne.. . I have never had this much problem with a boss. Im playing my usual first time build, str/fai. Blasphemous blade as my main weapon. Blasphemous claw as a tool. I have been stiÄ‡i for over a week now, i do NOT give up on bosses. But holy fuck... I was, to myself, SURE i Will never use a summon in the game. I have tried everything. Every possible tactic. Beast clergyman doesnt hit me ONCE. Maliketh Just dots me, and kills my wolves so fast, even if i can parry ONCE, the boss Just proceeds to kick my ass. Wow.. Just wow.. Fuck this boss.. I have 3 days off now.. I Will not sleep untill i beat it. 6 hours in now... Lets fucking go... I'll git gud eventually, i hope..
