So just off the bat, if your spouse got an extra 130,000 points, that would be worth $1300 of the bat. To add someone to your card, its $95/yr, but if they're paying the extra $600, not only do they get the points but now you both get $200 for more airline incidentals, $200 for FHR and the amazingly coveted Equinox credit (/s of course). Not sure how the 20,000 points for adding an AU is better than just a new signup and then cancelling it and holding a green or gold card after a year.
