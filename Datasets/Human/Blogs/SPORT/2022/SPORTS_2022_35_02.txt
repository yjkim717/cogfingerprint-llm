We're back learning more about /u/mgrunner . Be sure to tag /u/mgrunner in your comments if you have a question directed at them. ________________ **How/when did you start running?** I ran cc in high school, to only middling success. I think I was at best, low 18s and clearly left a lot of potential on the table. Our school didn't have a track, though we did have a team. I don't remember ever considering track as a sport. Fast forward to being 27 years old, and I was getting ready for my last day of student teaching, looked in the mirror, and said to myself "I'm fat. What happened?". After turning in my student teacher keys and posting my grades, I went home, grabbed whatever shoes I had, and tried to run a mile. It was 90+ degrees, and I was woefully out of shape, but I did it. The next day I ran two miles, then three, and in a couple weeks, I was up to double digits. Not smart training, to be sure, but it worked. I signed up for a marathon that fall (couch to marathon, I guess?!) and ran a 4:06. Kept at it, and in the spring of 2007 went 3:30 a couple times. A couple years after that I was sub 3:10, then had a breakthrough by going 2:53. By 2013, I ran my then PR of 2:48, but parenting, teaching, and coaching stalled me out for a long time. In late fall of 2018 I quit coaching, promised myself a return to serious training, and ran a few ultras in the spring of 2019 to only so-so results. In June of 2019 I stepped on the scale and found I was 25lbs overweight despite running decent mileage, so I doubled down on my training and started intermittent fasting. Didn't have one single cookie, candy bar, soda, or bowl of ice cream for months. Dropped the 25lbs, upped the mileage to 75-80, and ran 2:43 at 2019 Chicago. Kept at it, but then Covid hit. Stayed committed during the early pandemic, and in fall 2020 ran 2:40:05 on a hilly course. So dang close. Did a 2:39 time trail six weeks later, but I was still burned up about not having a bib on for a sub 2:40. So, kept grinding, built my mileage to 85-90 with respectable workouts and ran 2:37 this year at Chi, good for 5th in my AG as a 40-44 masters runner. So here I am. **PRs?** 5k: 16:15 10k: 34:06ish 13.1 1:15:51 marathon is 2:37:34 my proudest is 1:09:58 on a windy, rolling 20k course (which makes me believe there's more PRs to come) **Next Race?** Not sure about future races. I'll run a spring marathon, but nothing is written in ink for the spring and fall. Keeping my options open. After Chicago this fall, I feel as though I'm playing with house money. It hasn't made me complacent, but I feel much less stress about what races I do or don't do. **Goals this year?** Goal for this year is sub 2:34 marathon this fall in the 45-49 AG. I know I have it in me, just gotta get the right course conditions. **Favorite shoes to train or race in?** Favorite shoes to race in are the Next% (I feel gross admitting that), and as for trainers, I just ordered my second pair of Skechers Razor Excess. I really enjoyed my first pair of those this fall, and I'm psyched to put some miles on a new pair this spring. **What do you think has been the greatest contributor to your success in running?** There are two areas that have added to my success. One, and I'm knocking on wood here, but durability has been key for me. I don't have the best leg speed or natural talent, relatively speaking; however, I have been lucky to avoid the injury bug. Secondly, mileage just works for me, and I would say 95% of my success has been due to steady mileage in the 70-90mpw range. I still think I have some ceiling to work with there. **Whatâ€™s your favorite distance to race and why?** I love the marathon. It's a fickle distance to be sure, but I think it rewards those people who show up and do the work. Also, each marathon has a story in the later stages, and while some of those stories are pretty difficult, when things go well, there's nothing like it. **Favorite (or most successful) training style/principles that you follow?** I am totally a "by the seat of my pants" trainer. I have in mind my weekly volume and I then decide what it is I want to do any given week. So it might be MP, LT, or even 800s, but it's really day by day. Nobody's ever going to pay me a dollar to run, so I just won't force any workouts I don't want to do. I'm not wired to either write or follow a training plan. That said, I live by the Daniels running formula tables, and I often refer to the 5k-15k plan in the second edition. There's a lot of good stuff in there. **What is your why? What keeps you going? How does this play back into your training and motivation?** I just have to find out how good I can get and as I've worked harder, the PR's have kept coming. I really believe in hard work in all aspects of my life, and running is the same, especially the last few years. I take pride in consistently putting in the miles even when things are busy, exhausting, or the weather is terrible. This is going to sound arrogant, but as I age, one of my goals is to be one of the best masters runners in my AG at any given race. I got a late start in running, but my story has not been written yet. **Proudest Accomplishment?** Running 2:37 at Chicago this fall is probably my proudest accomplishment. The conditions were tough, it was humid and windy, but I dug in and ran the best race I could in those conditions. I placed 5th in my AG, which was an unthinkable accomplishment even a couple years ago. I was lucky to gain admission to the American Development program for that race, and I'm proud to say that I delivered a race worthy of that privilege. **Things you do outside of running?** I'm a husband and father foremost, and I'm lucky that my wife is so completely supportive of this venture. It's a total vanity project, and she has been nothing but amazing as we've navigated all the normal life hurdles that come with having a family. I'm an English teacher by career, and I like to do home improvement projects because there's a tangible outcome to my work. I love films and reading, and my wife and I have been traveling more as our kids have gotten older. Superfan of The Office and The Wire. **Favorite subreddits?** I'm more of a subreddit lurker than anything else, but r/advancedrunning, r/Brewers, r/runningshoegeeks, r/TheWire, and a few other places are my go-to's. **Origin of your username?** pass, lol. **Strava/Social Media link (if you care to share it)?** **Any questions for the community?** No questions for the community. I do want to say that I read tons of race reports on here, and I wish I had time to comment more on everyone's races. This is an inspiring, helpful, supportive place, and it's awesome to see where people are racing and how they are training. I'm going to try to comment more in the future, but I promise, I'm reading it all!
