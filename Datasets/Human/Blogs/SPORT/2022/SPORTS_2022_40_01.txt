Went golfing with a buddy this morning and we had a par-3 160. Water in front, slightly downhill green, and (because I have no length) I decide to take out the 5 iron and hope to just land on the front of the green and roll up to the back (I suck at golf and will basically use the 5 for any distance between 130 and 180). The hole is in the front third of the green, so I figure I'll hope to hit the green and figure it out later. Hit an amazing shot. It lands 6 inches into the green and rolls about 5 inches to the right of the hole, eventually coming to rest for about a 9 foot birdie putt. I'm about 10% to make the putt, but I also have the benefit of seeing my dew trail on the green. Line it up, about a hole and a half to the right to account for break, and drained it. My second birdie ever! Felt amazing. Celebrated by carding an 8 two holes later obviously lol
