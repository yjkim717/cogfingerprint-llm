I'm sure everyone is familiar with the Westbrook cycle by now. Ever since leaving OKC, he's started each season playing pretty horrible basketball before turning it around and playing like a top 15 player in the latter half of the season. So, which Westbrook had the worst first half? I think Wizards fans had it the worst. He was playing through a quad injury when he probably should have been resting. And he was terrible (except vs KD). He was fantastic to make a playoff push but he was the biggest reason why the Wizards were in such a hole in the first place. The Wizards also didn't have a top 5 player or a decent coach to keep their team afloat during the Worstbrook stretch. He was also pretty bad to start his Houston tenure. I believe he was also recovering from injury though not as severe as a quad injury. I actually think his start with the Lakers is his best start in years. Though he's been inconsistent, we saw the "Oh?" stretch of the cycle in November/December instead of January. He also came into the season healthy.
