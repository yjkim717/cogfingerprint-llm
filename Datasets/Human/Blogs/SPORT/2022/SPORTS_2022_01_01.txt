My son keeps nagging me about wanting a YouTube channel so he can put xbox videos on there. His mate is doing it (he's on PS) so of course he wants to do it too. Just curious, is it an easy thing to do and will it capture his game chat? I know with xbox you're limited to 5min clips, so my initial thought is to stream to twitch and then download/upload from there to YouTube - again, does twitch capture game chat as well or is it just game audio? Any advice or links to websites etc. would be much appreciated. TIA
