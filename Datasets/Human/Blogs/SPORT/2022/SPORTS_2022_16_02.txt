Oregon has retained possession of the College Football Belt with their 45–30 victory over UCLA, and continues their 3rd reign as Belt champions. The Ducks are now 9–18–1 in Belt Games, and the Bruins are now 27–23–3. Oregon’s next defense of the Belt is an away game next Saturday against California. This will be the Golden Bears’ 27th Belt game and their first since November 12, 2005, a 35–10 loss to Belt-holder USC. A recap of the Belt’s journey this season: * Week 1: Baylor retains the Belt against Albany * Week 2: Baylor loses the belt to BYU * Week 3: BYU loses the belt to Oregon * Week 4: Oregon retains the Belt against Washington State * Week 5: Oregon retains the Belt against Stanford * Week 6: Oregon retains the Belt against Arizona * Week 7: Oregon retains the Belt due to bye week * Week 8: Oregon retains the Belt against UCLA For those who don't know what the Belt is, it is an unofficial trophy that traces the lineage of the "best" teams going all the way back to the first-ever CFB game.
