If Rudy Gobert is getting traded for 4 first round picks, then the return required to get KD on a 4 year contract would be insane. The team that traded for KD would be crippled in terms of players and assets, and they would only have a few years to try to win a championship with an aging 34 year old who is injury prone. If the team traded away a lot of good players for KD, then they’d struggle to be championship contenders with him. We saw KD get swept in the first round with one of the best point guards in the league Kyrie, he can’t really carry a team in the playoffs like prime Lebron could. Not to mention the fact that he’s not very loyal, if things go badly then he could easily demand another trade next year.
