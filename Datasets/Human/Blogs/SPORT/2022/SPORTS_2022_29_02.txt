Hello all this is just a little rant of mine. I was at napili beach today enjoying the wonderful time and this group has came the past few days drunk as a snuck (I don’t care about people drinking on the beach) screaming and yelling saying vulgar words and talking about sex right in front of all these kids and parents. I can see why now you guys dislike how tourists behave when visiting your home. Okay I’m done ranting now.
