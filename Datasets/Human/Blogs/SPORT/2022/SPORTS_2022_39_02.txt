Sorry if this isn't the correct sub for this. I have the following equipment, a vizio m65q8-h1, an Apple TV 4K new remote one, a ps5, and a Harmon Kardon Avr-154(I know its old and will need to replace). I have 3 speakers, left, right, center and a powered sub, I think this is 3.1? The Apple TV and the ps5 ran to the tv with their own HDMI cables because I believe my receiver cannot pass through HD or 4k(not sure though) and I have audio out from the tv to the receiver with an optical cable. I like this as turning on the different devices turns the tv on and it selects the respective input, this won't turn on my receiver so I leave it on all the time. I also have to control the volume with the harmon remote, which I don't love, I like to be able to control the volume of the receiver with the Apple TV remote. I assume that will take a new receiver. Also every single app has different audio levels and switching between them involves lots of volume up and down, I've read that some receivers can self level the volume? This is where I am lost and need help. Can I get a receiver that will turn on with the device that's turned on and turn the tv on as well? can I use the apple remote to adjust the volume? Can a receiver equalize the volume levels? I mostly stream show on youtubetv, Netflix, Hulu, etc. Watch a lot of live music and stream music, which I can do through the Apple TV from phone/computer so I dont have to get a receiver that has streaming built in. I won't need 5 channels for movies/games, but maybe when I build my basement out I will put in more speakers. I could see 2 zones to add ceiling speakers for audio in the kitchen. Thanks for any input and help!
