Purchased a diesel JD 332 in the summer to do some loan and garden work and serve as a snowblower in the winter. Finally got a a few inches last night (3-4‚Äù) and I could not get this thing to work. The little I got it to actually shoot it would barely clear the snowblower. It would usually just clog the shoot and not do anything. I ended up using it as a plow to get the snow off our driveway but I need to figure it out before we get hit with a real snow storm. Any ideas what can cause this lack of power or speed in the blower?
