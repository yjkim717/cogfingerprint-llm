In Part 1 of the 2022 Trick Y’all Awards, I focused on the “doing nothing” part of the “running around, doing nothing” claim from Russell Westbrook when he accused PatBev of tricking us. For Part 2, I’d like to focus on the “running around” part. Method NBA.com provides data on distance traveled for “select games” via Second Spectrum. Unfortunately, it is not 100% of games, so there is some inherent “fuzziness” in the data. I don’t think there is a way around this, unfortunately: I’m not about to figure out what games aren’t captured and remove those game logs specifically from my data set. That’s a big ask. It looks to be around 95-97% of games, though, so I’m going to just pretend this isn’t an issue. There is one other, less minor issue. If you were to take the data on the NBA.com site, and calculate the miles per hour yourself (using the minutes played and distance traveled), you get different values than what they have for nearly every player. It isn't a consistent difference, either: the calculated speed is anywhere from 5 to 7% faster than the NBA internal numbers. The problem gets worse the fewer minutes that are played. My best guess has to do with how the data is stored from game to game (dropping everything after the decimal on a per game basis). Just a guess, though. The upshot to this is that I'm going to re-calculate distance based on my numbers for minutes played and distance traveled, so the leaderboard will look (slightly) different than the official one. I’m going to restrict the data to the 413 players who ran a marathon this year during NBA games (the fewest minutes played by marathoners in the NBA this year? Kira Lewis Jr, at 341 minutes). The first natural question would be: who traveled the most this season? |Player|Miles Traveled| |:-|:-| |Mikal Bridges|212.5| |Miles Bridges|210.7| |Tyrese Halliburton|206.7| |Tyrese Maxey|206.1| |Scottie Barnes|201.1| |Harrison Barnes|195.1| Can I just say something really quick? What the absolute fuck wizardry is this? The first two spots are the two players with the last name "Bridges." The next two are the two players with the first name "Tyrese." The next two are the two players with last name "Barnes." Mikal Bridges ran more-or-less the distance from the "Footprint" Center to the Gulf of California last season. And, interestingly, Russell Westbrook is 15th place on this list, travelling 186.3 miles and also this one time. We're not here for count statistics, though. We're here for rate stats. Here's the same list, sorted by miles per hour: &#x200B; |Player|MPH|Marathon Pace| |:-|:-|:-| |Matt Thomas|4.97|5:16:25| |T.J. McConnell|4.96|5:16:42| |Dalano Banton|4.95|5:17:18| |Doug McDermott|4.94|5:18:04| |Josh Green|4.91|5:20:13| (*Very* eagle-eyed viewers of part 1 will look at this list and their spidey-sense will go off. This same list appeared in a reply to a comment from the extremely handsome u/martintee under the guise of "feet per stuff," which we will soon to get to. unfortunately, I fucked that up originally and instead computed feet per minute. My sincerest apologies, I fucked up. I consider myself a man of faith, I'm not sure I'll be putting this headset on again, you get the gist). As a Bulls fan, I would never, once, imagined that Matt Thomas would be the fastest man in basketball. The numbers don't lie: Mr. 99 Percent is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like. I have a theory. None of these players on the top of the list are very good players, and they generally aren't going to be holding the ball at the top of the key. They travel to the ends of the court, motion around, and generally don't stay in one place very long. They aren't posting up, they aren't anchoring defenses, and they aren't trusted with the ball in their hands (generally). Running around is what they can do, so that's what they do do. It's at this point that we have to visit Mr. PatBev. The claim that he "runs around" is verifiably false. Beverley is 334th of 413 marathoners in the NBA this year. Beverley clocks in at 4.25 mph (the same as Giannis). That said, Westbrook is even slower: Russell averages 4.17mph in his time on the court: 366th of qualified players. &#x200B; |Player|MPH|Have they played for the Houston Rockets?|Have they won an NBA title?| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Chris Paul|3.82|Yes|No| |James Harden|3.84|Yes|No| |LeBron James|3.85|No|Yes| |Eric Gordon|3.91|Yes|No| |Marcus Morris|3.95|Yes|No| This is a list of players that have the ball in their hands all the time (also, Marcus Morris for some reason.) Gordon is a prolific "doesn't do stuff guy" so he's somewhat of an outlier here. You also see a lot of centers and and the like this low (Enes Freedom and Embiid are 6th and 7th on this list, and Vucevic is 10th). Let's bring this home. We know how much stuff NBA players do. We also know how much running around they do. Which players run around, doing nothing? The simplest way to look at this (and the one we'll tackle today) is to just sort by FPS - Foot per Stuff: &#x200B; |Player|Feet Per Stuff|SPM Ranking (worst is first)| |:-|:-|:-| |Wesley Matthews|785|3rd| |Rodney Hood|783|1st| |Matt Thomas|769|9th| |Tony Snell|753|2nd| |Avery Bradley|729|4th| That's a strong proof of concept, if I say so myself. The list is chock full of people who contribute almost nothing to the watchability of an NBA game. It also confirms what I think most people thought intuitively: just counting up stuff done and dividing by minutes gives a good proxy for "running around, doing nothing:" the difference in running around just doesn't add up to that much. &#x200B; |Player|Feet Per Stuff|SPM Ranking (best is first)| |:-|:-|:-| |Joel Embiid|211|2nd| |Giannis Antetokounmpo|218|1st| |Nikola Jokic|225|3rd| |Luka Doncic|226|4th| |DeMarcus Cousins|239|5th| |LeBron James|251|8th| Same story on the top of the chart. This list has basically the best players in the league, and also LeBron James for some reason (the only member of this elite group not to make the playoffs this season.) |Player|Feet Per Stuff|Rank| |:-|:-|:-| |Russell Westbrook|290|22nd (95th-percentile)| |Patrick Beverley|382|111th (73rd-percentile)| With this, we can put the statement to bed: Patrick Beverley does **not** trick y'all, running around, doing nothing. In fact, PatBev neither runs around, nor does nothing. **Wrap-Up** Is there any value to this slightly different way of figuring out which players do stuff and which players don't? I think so. There are still plenty of valid criticisms of this method (it doesn't measure deflections, or help defense, or screening, or plenty of actual basketball "stuff"), but to that I'd say: sounds like an awful lot of work for a shitpost, man. I might do *one* more of these in the near future, because there is a slightly different definition of the way that you can take Westbrook's meaning (which NBA player is the best close-up magician? Clearly Magic "Trick Dick" Johnson.) That post might be a slightly more difficult statistical lift, so we'll see.
