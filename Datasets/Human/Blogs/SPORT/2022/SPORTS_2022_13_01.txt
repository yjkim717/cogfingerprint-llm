My dad uses Android and uses the Google messages app for SMS messages. He then can sign into their online messages system and read and respond to his messages there. Is there anyway to do this with iPhone? Not talking about iMessage messages. Just SMS messages. I know Verizon has an SMS messaging app so didnâ€™t know if there was a setup I could use for that.
