## Week 13 * Preseason * Week 2 * Week 3 * Week 4 * Week 5 * Week 6 * Week 7 * Week 8 * Week 9 * Week 10 * Week 11 * Week 12 * Basketball Edition This is a series I've now been doing for 8 years. The post attempts to visualize all AP Poll ballots in a single image. Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is not a measure of how "good" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on. Rick Wright of the Albuquerque Journal has replaced Stephen Wagner, the 3rd New Mexico area beat writer in the poll this season. Nick Kelly was the most consistent voter this week. Zach Osterman (started week 12), is the most consistent voter this season, followed by Nick Kelly, Matt Murschel, Kayla Anderson, and Trevor Hass. Jon Wilner was the biggest outlier this week. Jon Wilner is also in 1st on the season, followed by Mike Berardino, Nathan Baird, Jack Ebling, and Sam McKewon.
