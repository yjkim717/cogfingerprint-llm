Either you add tracking details and it allows you to mark the item as shipped. Or you dont add tracking numbers and have to manually message all buyers that it has been posted. I noticed the ‘add tracking details later’ option had dissappeared so i asked them on twitter about it and they confirmed you cannot mark an item as shipped without adding tracking numbers. What idiot at depop thinks of this? Every day the app seems to be more and mote unfriendly to sellers.
