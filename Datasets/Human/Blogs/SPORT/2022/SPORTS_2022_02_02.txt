I am in the process of planning and budgeting for our backyard remodel which includes a covered area (20'x20'). Based on the height of the back of the house and size of the pavilion we will need to do a low slope (approx 1:12) coming from the house out with with a ledger board, 16" center 2x10 rafters, and 2 pillars holding a doubled 2x10 for a beam. The roof will likely be standing seam. If I did all of this in red cedar it would be around 8-9k just for the lumber. I know it's mainly aesthetics but is red cedar worth that kind of price tag? Can I achieve a similar look with a cheaper wood stained (no PT)? I am even considering doing 2x8s (12" center) on the inside and then getting just the pillars and the exterior facing joists and beams in red cedar and then covering the inside ceiling with wood panel (There would be that 2" difference between the inside ceiling and the bottom of the exterior rafter). Does doing something like this make sense or worth while?
