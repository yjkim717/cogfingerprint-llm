I’ve been a part of this sub for 3 to 4 months, mainly lurking. One thing I have never been able to grasp is how to use relative strength in practice. I’ve never known if I should find a strong stock and wait for a setup or just enter because it is strong. And yes - I’ve read the wiki. Just something never clicked for me. &#x200B; Before finding this sub, I used to exclusively trade flag patterns (pullbacks) with next-to-no success. I was basically breaking even. Since using this sub’s techniques, the flag pattern has been stuck with me. I have been looking for a relatively strong stock and waiting for a flag pattern to enter. Honestly, the only difference for me was instead of waiting on a perfect flag pattern, I would wait for an okay pattern on a relatively strong/weak stock. The only affect the SPY had on me was finding a strong stock. &#x200B; I posted this question a few nights ago and had two helpful replies, however, u/izzagman’s has completely opened my mind to this new strategy after 4 months of being here. I highly recommend you look at u/izzyGman’s response here if this strategy hasn’t clicked for you yet. I’ll sum up his response with one quote from his comment. &#x200B; >“Notice that you are trading the market using a vehicle (AAPL) that will give you an edge if used properly. You aren’t thinking about AAPL, but about what SPY is doing, and plan your entries and exits accordingly.” &#x200B; This has opened my eyes. I was trading the stock because it was strong. I have not been trading the SPY via the stock. Hari’s idea of a thesis make so much more sense now. You have to have an idea on what the SPY is doing because you are trading the SPY. You are just trading the SPY through a stock that is relatively strong/weak to it. While I haven’t taken a trade with this new epiphany I’ve had, thanks to u/izzyGman, I think I will begin to have so much more success now. &#x200B; I hope this can help those like me that have not quite grasped the concept of the strategy here. And once again, thank you u/izzygman for your thoughtful reply. It has helped me so much.
