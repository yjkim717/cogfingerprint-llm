I stumbled on this earlier and it feels very much like a "Yep, those are my readers" idea so I brought it here. Of course, this is almost entirely based on when and where you hit puberty so there are no wrong answers but I thought it would still be fun to see what answers people had. Did it constantly evolve and change over time? Or did those first people become locked permanently? Is it a mix? Is it the actress/actor as themselves or is is one specific part? Is it more musicians or models instead? BONUS QUESTION: What is Bill's choices: Kelly Preston; Lisa Bonet; Tiffani Amber-Thiessen; but who is fourth? Did Sydney already make the top 4 or is that just a fling still?
