I (25M) asked a former coworker (22F) out to lunch this past Saturday. She said yes and seemed pretty enthusiastic about it. We messaged through Instagram to set up a time and place, and the messages were a little spaced out the week leading up to it - anywhere from 6 hours apart to an entire day later - but we got things figured out and met up just fine. It seemed to go well, time was a little limited (I had to work that evening and she had plans with a friend anyway) but we had a nice hour long conversation over lunch and got to know each other better. We agreed it'd be great to go out again sometime, with her suggesting "something fun" in the college town not far from us. Sunday evening I sent a follow-up message saying thanks for lunch and reiterating interest in meeting again, and gave her my number - my dumbass didn't think to exchange numbers at lunch, which might be the first mistake. The message went unread all day Monday but I figured she's busy at work and again, our previous messages were kinda sporadic so I tried not to be too bothered. I checked Instagram just by chance earlier today and noticed I was now left on read. Did I mess up somewhere along the line - not exchanging numbers, waiting too long to follow up, leaving the ball in her court? Should I just take this as a sign of disinterest? Do I follow up again? I'll be wrapped up with work this weekend so I wasn't planning on trying to set up but depending on my schedule next weekend I was eager to schedule another date... but if I'm being left on read already, is it even worth it?
