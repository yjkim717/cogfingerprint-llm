Home grown: career lifer with their current team, or very close to that **Boston Celtics**: Tatum, Brown, Smart, and Timelord are arguably their four best players, and all drafted by Boston. **Golden State Warriors**: Their OG core of Steph/Klay/Dray is still going strong and recent Warriors pick Jordan Poole has emerged. Again, the four best players on a top tier contender are all home grown. **Phoenix Suns**: Booker, Ayton, Bridges, Cam Johnson are the home grown backbone of this Suns team, and they hired the perfect conductor in Chris Paul. **Philadelphia 76ers**: Embiid and Maxey look like their two best players so far in the postseason, and both were drafted in Philly, though all-star James Harden was brought in to orchestrate their offense. **Milwaukee Bucks**: Giannis alone makes the Bucks home grown. But though Khris was drafted in Detroit, he only played 475 minutes for them in his rookie year before being traded to Milwaukee. He developed from the 39th pick to an all-star there. **Memphis Grizzlies**: Ja, Desmond Bane, Jaren Jackson Jr, and Dillon Brooks were all drafted in Memphis and are now their four most important players. **Utah Jazz**: Star duo Gobert and Mitchell were both drafted in the first round by Utah. **Dallas Mavericks**: Luka alone is enough to be home grown, but Jalen Brunson is another Dallas pick who's been a huge contributor all year and now in the postseason. Defensive lynchpins Dorian Finney-Smith and Maxi Kleber are also Dallas products. **Toronto Raptors**: Siakam, FVV, Scottie Barnes, and OG Annunoby are possibly their four best players, and look to continue fighting in the first round. **Denver Nuggets**: Built on the back of MVP Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, and Michel Porter, though with two of their talents out they stare at a first round exit. **Minnesota Timberwolves**: Built around first overall picks Karl Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards, but brought in former all-star D'Angelo Russel as their floor general. **Atlanta Hawks**: Trae Young is enough to be home-grown but they also have drafted supporting players such as Deandre Hunter, John Collins, and Kevin Huerter. **Miami Heat**: They're a prime free agent destination and their best player is FA signing Jimmy Butler. But homegrown talents Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro are his two best teammates and essential to the success of Miami. --- There are a couple teams that don't rely as much on home grown talent, let's look at how they're doing. **New Orleans Pelicans**: Ideally they'd like to build around healthy NOLA #1 pick Zion Williamson, but Brandon Ingram is stepping up in the meantime. Ingram spend his first three seasons in LA but grew from potential to bonafide all-star in New Orleans. Herb Jones and Jose Alvarado are nice pieces who were drafted in NOLA but they rely heavily on contributions from acquisitions like McCollum and Valanciunas. They are down 1-2 in the first round to the reigning West champs and look to make it an interesting series as the 8 seed. **Chicago Bulls**: Their only homegrown star is Zach Lavine, who was obtained in the Jimmy Butler trade and eventually given the keys to the franchise. But their best player is FA acquisition Demar Derozan. Ball and Caruso are crucial role players obtained in FA. Vucevic was recently acquired via trade. They face a 1-2 deficit and an uphill climb against the reigning champs. **Brooklyn Nets**: lol --- It seems like artificially assembled superteams have not had much success this season. Does drafting your talent remain the most reliable path to becoming a contender? Seems like it.
