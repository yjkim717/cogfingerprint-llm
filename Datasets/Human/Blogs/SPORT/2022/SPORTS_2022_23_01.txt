Marching bands are what make CFB great. Is your band travelling anywhere this year? For those of you who might be unaware, there was some drama between the Hawkeye Marching Band (HMB) and some Cyclone fans following El Assico 2019 where some HMB members ended up being hurt, but also they didn't exit the way they were told to do so, etc. Low and behold, last year the HMB did not return to Ames and the same is happening this year with the ISUCF'V'MB, as they won't be making the trip to Iowa City for El Assico 2022. So the ISUCF'V'MB is heading to Lawrence, Kansas. Where is your band going (if you know)?
