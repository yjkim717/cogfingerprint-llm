What are we thinking about Klay? Was surprised to see he had an ADP of around 60 on Yahoo, which seems pretty high for someone who offers value in just a few categories; even at his best he's only providing 3s, points, and FT% (low volume FT% too..). However, after a rusty start, minutes capped at what looks like 28-30 for the rest of the season, and the possibility of resting B2Bs as well.. he seems like a potentially big bust. But he could always turn it around and get hot, and is capable of 18-20 ppg and 3-4 threes in just 28 mins a night if he gets back to decent form. So what do y'all think? Slow start, and potentially a buy-low target right now? Or is he an overrated fantasy asset at this point, and a sell-before-he-gets-lower guy? I'm still intrigued by his fantasy profile for my punt FG%/Reb build, and thinking of sending a Clarkson & Bojan offer to buy low right now and free up a roster spot.. but having second thoughts as Bojan is actually looking like a much better fantasy option with a more secure role & minutes. Has Klay really become worse than Bojan?
