Yesterday has I was driving home from picking my child up from daycare, a car blocked the intersection so I couldn’t turn and it turned out to have a Kansas State license plate frame and now I must hate them forever. One of my best friends held a door for South Carolina QB Dylan Thompson and expected Dylan to hold the door for him, and when he didn’t he hit the door and Dylan Thompson laughed at him - and he still hasn’t forgiven him What’s the pettiest thing that made you hate a team/player?
