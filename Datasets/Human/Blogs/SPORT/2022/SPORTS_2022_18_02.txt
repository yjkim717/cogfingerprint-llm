I have recently started a new position with a company specializing in selling mechanical presses and servo presses. One of my goals is to have our website be the top ranking website when one searches "servo press." I noticed that a large majority of the websites that come up are simple product pages. These pages usually have a short description of their company and their own servo presses. All in all, the pages are mostly pretty simple. I am thinking of writing a very detailed article for our website all about "What is a Servo Press: 8 Advantages to be aware of" that acts as a landing page to our own products. In some ways, I feel like this can be successful as there are not great articles on this yet, however, I'm not quite sure this matches searchers intent. Would redoing our product page to be better than the competitors page be the best option? Currently, our product page isn't titled Servo press for have proper meta tags to even rank within the first few pages. Overall, I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
