As the Blazers shipped Norman Powell out of Portland today, it seems that they have kicked start the rebuilding process and tries to drive Dame out. The second reasonable step would be trading CJ. CJ is a great mid-range shooter and a clutch player which can score from three levels. Yet, given Harden's latest situation, it seems that Philly is gonna pursue Harden or Dame before considering CJ. I honestly can't think of a contending team who needs CJ at this moment. Maybe NY can do it by trading Alec Burks and Fournier for him? Could Indiana trade Levert and Warren for CJ? What do you guys think about CJ's future?
