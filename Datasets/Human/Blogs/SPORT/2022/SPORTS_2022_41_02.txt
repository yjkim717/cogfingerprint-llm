### Post in Question Bit of a confusing situation. This post, mildly spammy, but relatively benign, was posted on /r/CFB. The title was 'hihi' and the submission text was empty, which is a fairly garden variety spam post. What makes this post different is that it was posted by a Reddit Admin, who then stickied the post. I saw it was stickied and was confused, because when I checked our mod log, there was no record of anyone stickying the post, and then I checked the user and saw it was a Reddit admin. This has actually caused some additional problems, because since there's a maximum of 2 stickies per sub, this removed the bottom sticky. The post was deleted 7 minutes after posting (in which time 46 confused comments from users came in). My questions: 1. What? 2. Can you not do this in the future? It seems likely this was just an error, a new admin being trained, or testing something. I would ask that Reddit admins avoid doing this on our sub (or really anything but test subs), and reconsider policies on which admins have mod permissions on which subs. **Edit:** Additionally, it may have launched a push notification to _all_ subscribers via the iOS app? Maybe that's what was being tested but that is incredibly spammy and reflects poorly on our subreddit.
