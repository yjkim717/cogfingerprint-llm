I’m not sure how well this will work but let’s give it a try. Long story short: it will just be a way to repeat some of our favorite lines. But here is the hook. First person picks one of their favorite lines. The reply has to be a quote from the person that character was talking to. Example. >Joey says “Could I be wearing anymore clothes?!?” Who is is talking to? Chandler. So the reply can be any line Chandler says to anyone. And so on. Either join one in progress or start your own.
