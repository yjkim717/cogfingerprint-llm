I have a few LCs I have had for about a year and a half, stored in my fridge the majority of that time. I haven't had them out in a year, but decided to grow again. One was a blackish/grey and pretty gross looking, which has been tossed. The others looked fine so I gave them a mix and am letting them chill for a few days before use, mixing a few times a day(quart jar with a broken piece of glass in it). One of them the mycelium at rest concentrates on the bottom and the other concentrates on the top. Wondering if anyone has noticed this before? I have used both these cultures before and have never had contam from them. I haven't paid much attention to LCs before or gave it much thought, but I think I have seen different LCs with top or bottom congregation. I am curious as to how long y'all have stored LCs and what you have seen as far as viability goes.
