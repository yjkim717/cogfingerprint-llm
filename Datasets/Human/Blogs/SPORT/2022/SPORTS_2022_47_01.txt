Just finished up my weekend league at 8-12 which is a good result for me! One thing that plagued my entire weekend league was getting pressed into my own half and losing the ball a lot. I wanted some pointers on how to handle this better. I tried a few different approaches but none seemed to work. First I tried to play long balls but those were often 50/50 and whenever I did breakaway on the counter, I would get closed down before i could create a chance. I also tried to play more possession and set up instruction in a 451 to load bodies in the midfield and the buildplay on possession. This helped against the press but i found myself not having enough dynamic runs in the opposition half. EDIT: thanks for the tips everyone! Doing much better in rivals by using more width with the hug the sidelines setting. I can now find so many gaps. I also messed around with camera settings as per some advice in here. Turns out I was way too zoomed in lol. Reduced zoom helps me spot so many open players. Really appreciate the help!
