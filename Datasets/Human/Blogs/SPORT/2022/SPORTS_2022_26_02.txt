This past year, I reconnected with the game via Arena after a loooong hiatus. Decided to pull out some old cards I’ve been holding onto for a long time- mostly Alpha through Arabian Nights and mostly LP or MP with a handful or NM. Was shocked to see current prices on some of these on TCG Player. To give a sense, the best of the lot are Beta Timetwister, Alpha Gauntlet of Might and Alpha Forcefield- all three of which I think would be NM. So now I’m wondering if it’s worth paying to get some of these graded. Is there a standard value cut off y’all use to determine if it’s worth it? Or maybe a differential between LP and NM that makes it worth the gamble?
