Hello, we are visiting this week at Napili Bay and noticed they are still lots of families and little kids and good sized crowds here. Beach seems pretty packed each day. Maybe it was just my misunderstanding of how many people there would be, I’m assuming it’s much worse during the summer. Aren’t little ones in school during this time of year? Sorry I’m not trying to complain just surprised how many people are here as we were told this would be one of the least busy months.
