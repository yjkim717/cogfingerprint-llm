Hey everyone! My clan Pink Frauds (PS5 + PC) is recruiting after a recent shake-up, and I’d personally love some more players, both PvP and PvE oriented. We’re an extremely chill bunch - most are 30 or above and friendly. Most of us are UK based but there’s a couple of Americans and Dutch players too. There is ‘banter’ or whatever but it doesn’t have that kind of weird mean-spirited/toxic element you sometimes see, and we have rules against slurs (as more than one of our members are queer, including myself). The clan as a whole is PvE oriented which is great, but personally I spend a lot of my free time in PvP when there isn’t a raid scheduled that evening. There’s only a couple of us at the moment who play lots of PvP - there’s a handful of good PvP players, but only me and one other who spend most of their time there and actively looks forward to Trials weekends. I’m a top 0.1% Trials player (or I was before the ELO resets last season), and would like some players to run QP, Comp and Trials with. You don’t have to be at that level or a top whatever percent player, just someone who likes PvP and has an easy-going and friendly nature. I’ve been wary about recruiting PvP-oriented players through simple invites because, generally speaking, they tend to be more toxic and slur-happy - I’ve had (many) bad experiences recruiting that way, so I thought I’d try here. For those who prefer PvE, the majority of players here focus on that and we’d love more people to raid with.
