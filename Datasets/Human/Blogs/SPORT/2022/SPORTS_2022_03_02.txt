Salutations, /r/NFL! Week 1 is in the books and holy hell what kind of week that was! I told you, the first week is always cuckoo bananas and this year did not disappoint. I hope everyone did well in their predictions, because I sure as hell didn't. I went 8-8 and I felt I was one of the lucky ones. We still have nothing concrete to go off for this week, so we'll just see where things take us. We have five division games this week, with a doubleheader on Monday. Let's get to it! --- Winner||Loser|Comments -|-|-|- [](/KC) Chiefs|over|[](/LAC) Chargers| Both teams got their first win of the season and are looking to keep things rolling. KC is hosting their first home game and we all know how loud Arrowhead is going to be against a division opponent. The Chargers need to get a running game going behind Herbert, who might be without Allen due to hamstring issues. Taking the home team on this one. [](/CLE) Browns|over|[](/NYJ) Jets| Flacco is pretty good against the Browns (17-3), but that was when he was a Raven. Now, not so much. Look for Garrett to sack Flacco at least a couple times while Chubb and Hunt run the ball through the Jets' defense. Browns go 2-0 this week. [](/WAS) Commanders|over|[](/DET) Lions| Washington looked serviceable under Wentz and they're hoping to take the streak on the road in Detroit. Campbell may already be on the hot seat. Detroit is slightly favored this week, but the Lions secondary is going to struggle to cover all of the Commanders receiving weapons. A coin flip favoring Washington for me. [](/NO) Saints|over|[](/TB) Buccaneers| Upset/Homer pick of the week. Brady has never beaten the Saints in the regular season since joining the Bucs (0-4). Both teams have amazing offensive weapons, but I'd have to pick CGM over Evans, especially since Lattimore will once again embarrass Evans by completely shutting him down. The key will come down to the Saints O-line waking up and protecting Winston (who suffered his season-ending injury in this exact matchup last year), and the defense do what they do best and shutting down Brady. Saints in another close one at home in the Dome. [](/NYG) Giants|over|[](/CAR) Panthers| The Giants have a chance to be an unexpected 2-0 team of the early season under Daboll. Barkley, who had 194 total yards against the Titans in Week 1, is showing he was the better 2018 draft pick. Mayfield will try to lead another comeback, but this one falls short. This one ends up being close because I’m still not convinced either of these teams is as well-balanced as some would like to believe. [](/PIT) Steelers|over|[](/NE) Patriots| There are some key injuries here, including Jones (back) and Harris (foot) for the Pats and T.J. Watt (pec) for the Steelers, so the field will look a little different. New England is the road favorite, but Pittsburgh pulls off another upset. My pick may change if Jones ends up playing. [](/IND) Colts|over|[](/JAX) Jaguars| The Colts were a Week 1 dud in a tie against Houston given the talent Ryan has to work with. They can't afford a road slip-up against another division opponent. Lawrence makes some bad throws putting the Jags in too difficult of a situation to climb out of. The Colts gain an early lead and lean on Taylor to maintain it. [](/MIA) Dolphins|over|[](/BAL) Ravens| Possible game of the week here. Jackson and Tua were efficient in the opener without the help of a good running game. Tua looked better, clicking early with Hill and Waddle. If Jackson can play like we know he's able to, the Ravens could makes this a close one. [](/LAR) Rams|over|[](/ATL) Falcons| The Rams a well-rested coming off a home loss to Buffalo and looking to get a home win this week off a team that is well known for blowing leads. It's a safe bet to not trust Atlanta to pull off a win even leading by two TDs. I do think this'll be a lose game, though, with Mariota making plays and Patterson running all over the place, but L.A. takes the win on this one. [](/SEA) Seahawks|over|[](/SF) 49ers| If Week 1 taught us anything it's don't write off Geno Smith. I'm not sure how much longer we can say that, but if he plays as well as he did against Denver, then the Seahawks can get their first division win on the road this week. I don't think Trey Lance is it, and we may be seeing Jimmy G back real soon. [](/CIN) Bengals|over|[](/DAL) Cowboys| Dak is out, making this a pretty easy pick for this matchup. The Bengals should get back into things after a disastrous Week 1 in which Burrow threw four INTs. One thing Joey B is known for is bouncing back and this week is no exception. [](/DEN) Broncos|over|[](/HOU) Texans| Coming off that crazy upset, Denver now has an opportunity to even their record out against the lethargic Texans team. Wilson should be able to get his new team back on track and secure his first win in the blue and orange at home. [](/OAK) Raiders|over|[](/ARI) Cardinals| Unfortunately for the Cardinals, I don’t think we’ll see anything too different from their Week 1 steamrolling. Vegas almost came out with a win last week and I think they'll improve enough to get a home win this week. As long as Carr cuts down on the turnovers, the Raiders are more than capable of scoring in bunches. [](/GB) Packers|over|[](/CHI) Bears| Rodgers will have his trusty Bears matchup to let off some steam this week. Though the Bears got a win last week against a terrible 49ers team, this division opponent quite frequently has their number. Rodgers makes a few big plays despite a lack of strong O-line play and a true No. 1 WR. [](/BUF) Bills|over|[](/TEN) Titans| This should be a good one and possibly closer than people think. The Bills offense is explosive, with Allen using a number of dangerous weapons in the passing game and a well-rounding running attack. Their defense is just as good. The Titans have Henry, but what else? Apart from a few exceptional pieces on defense, this team hasn't shown anything special in Week 1. The lack of A.J. Brown is being felt, and Buffalo will remind them of that. [](/MIN) Vikings|over|[](/PHI) Eagles| The Vikings might actually be legit this year. The O’Connell offense delivered in its debut, as Cousins and Jefferson lit up the Packers defense in Week 1 and will look to keep the good times rolling in Week 2. If Minnesota contain Hurts and keeps him from running up the score, this should be a solid win for them. --- Those are my predictions, let's hear yours. Keep it civil and fun. Good luck! **Update:** 6-10, that was terrible! One to Week 3!
