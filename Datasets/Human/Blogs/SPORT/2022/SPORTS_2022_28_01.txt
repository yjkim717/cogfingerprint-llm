Scott made his MLB debut in 1996, appearing in 36 games and batting a better-than-I-would .254. He really started to get good at the plate in 1997, and won Rookie of the Year that year (he juuuuuust made the cut, with 130 at-bats in 1996, which is quite literally the upper limit for rookie status). Of course, his 1995 Bowman's Best Blue is the most-common high-price "rookie" card, but under current thinking it doesn't qualify; he was still a prospect at the time (I'm treating this the same as the 1985 McGwire). He appeared in a handful of major-release sets in 1996 - his MLB debut year - with 1996 Topps #434 and a Bowman and a Bowman' Best release. These could, I guess, count as his rookie cards because it's his big league debut year and in the case of Topps it's the same as the Dale Murphy Rookie Card (1977 Topps #476). In 1997, his true rookie year, he appeared in Topps, Upper Deck, Flair, and Topps Chrome sets, among others. So the question is: which card constitutes his true rookie card? Would it be that 1996 Topps or Bowman? Or do those still count as prospect cards like his 1995 cards do?
