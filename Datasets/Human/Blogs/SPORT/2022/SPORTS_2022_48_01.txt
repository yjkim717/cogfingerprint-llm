I should be getting my PS classic today and am interested in hacking it for roms. I’m wondering which is the best software to use. Noticed at the top of the age there’s autobleem and retroboot. Which one do you guys recommend or is there another you suggest is better? Edit: also what additional hardware do I need. When i did this for nes and snes all I had to do was plug it into a computer. Is there any additional hardware?
