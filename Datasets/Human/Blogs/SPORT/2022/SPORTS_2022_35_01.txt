###**Last week, on Photo Friday:** /u/Daveyj343 grabbed the top up spot. > > > Christmas Day parkrun, lost 120lbs in 2020 and kept it off in 2021. This photo shows I had more to lose but I still like it /u/kai_hayley grabbed the first runner up spot. > link > > Easy out and back with my running buddy on Tuesday. One of the prettiest sunsets I've seen in a while. /u/LankySugar7254 grabbed the second runner up spot. > First decent snow of the year. ###**Rules of the Road** * Post your running photos of any kind! Beautiful running route? Post it! Race photo look great? Post it! Eastern time = early post for Pacific time! Nobody really reads this! Basically if it is running related you can post it. * Next Friday I will take the top photos and give them special attention.
