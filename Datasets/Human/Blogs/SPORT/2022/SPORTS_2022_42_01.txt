Wolves are 8-4 when he plays 20 or more minutes in a game. Sample size stuff but seriously, the kid has impact on the court when he's out there. He's been DNP'd in 2 of the last 5 games and has only played 10+ minutes in 2 games since the Denver win on 2/1. There's little/no reason to let Ant, DLo, and Malik continue to brick 3's if they're cold. Some nights just aren't their nights. If that's happening, use guys who have performed. I like Finch's coaching but if a guy's not bringing it and someone else has (Nowell played very well for a stretch and then we stopped playing him for the most part), why not give it more of a look?
