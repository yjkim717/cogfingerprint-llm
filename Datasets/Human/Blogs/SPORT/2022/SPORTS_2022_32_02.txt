by Bobak Ha'Eri The No. 5 Saint John's defense stepped up as the Johnnies defeated the No. 4 University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Warhawks, 24-10, in Collegeville. After a close first half, filled with errors and adjustments by both teams, the SJU defense came to life in the second and held UWW to only 4 total yards on their final seven drives. It was the marquee match of Week 1 in Division III, featuring the top programs out of the MIAC and WIAC. Both made it into the D3 playoff in 2021, UW-Whitewater lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Mary Hardin-Baylor; SJU made it to the Second Round. Both ended the 2021 campaign with only those losses. This non-conference season opener attracted a crowd of 12,462 on a sunny, 69Â° afternoon. The two teams have 10 national titles between them, with SJU's most recent in 2003 and all six of UWW's won during Lance Leipold's eight years as head coach (2007-14). The opinion of SJU fans was summarized by an elderly Johnnie alumnus outside the game: "They're a good Division 2 team." That kind of comment is dripping with the opinion among some D3 fans that the WIAC allows their teams the latitude to build what amounts to quasi-scholarship football among its members (which comprise the 8 public universities that were originally the Wisconsin State system, before that was folded in to the University of Wisconsin system causing them all to be named University of Wisconsin-). The MIAC, to the opposition of SJU, famously kicked out St. Thomas a few years ago because their program had become so large and sweepingly successful that the majority of other schools felt they didn't belong anymore (the Tommies are now D1). Respected Minnesota sportswriter Patrick Reusse mentioned he thought the future of D3 is a split between "programs that give a damn about college football, and those who don't." You see this same dichotomy at Division 2 and NAIA. Frankly, when watching D3 football at this stage of the season, you don't have as much to go on. There are no significant preseason magazines, no clear read on the players coming in and the adjustments by the returning players. One could argue that this isn't too different than covering preseason football at any level, but there's simply less out there to examine in D3. So, you look at what's working. The first half was highly entertaining football, as both teams were testing their offseason plans against difficult opponents that capitalized on mistakes. UWW put the first five points on the board all by themselves: first by botching a shotgun snap that the QB had to fall on in his own endzone for a safety, then kicking a field goal on the next drive to make it 3-2 at the end of the first quarter. The SJU offense capitalized on a UWW fumble in the second quarter to go up 9-3, and UWW's subsequent 68-yard march down the field ended with a missed FG to end the half. UWW opened the second half with a 78-yard drive behind sophomore running back Tamir Thomas, who didn't see the field in the first half. The Warhawks then tricked SJU to committing to a run defense on their own 4 and QB Evan Lewandowski passed to an open WR Tyler Holte to make it 10-9, UWW. After quickly getting the ball back from SJU, the Warhawks snapping went awry again, as the punter lost control of the ball leading to a second safety for SJU and a 11-10 lead at 6:50 in the third quarter. Special team errors continued to haunt the Warhawks on the subsequent drive, as their returner muffed the SJU punt, giving the Johnnies the ball in the UWW redzone. The SJU offense, which previously stalled, made three quick passes to make it an 18-10 lead. From that point, the Johnnies defense tightened and kept the rest of the UWW drives to 3-and-outs and eventually two desperation 4-and-outs. Frustratingly for the Warhawks, a muffed punt by SJU's returner in their own territory resulted in no UWW points as a sack pushed them out of field goal range. **UW-Whitewater observations:** * Good kicker in Nathan Custer, who's kickoffs sailed back and went 1/1 on FGs. * Sophomore RB Tamir Thomas was brought into the game in to start the second half and briefly had the Johnnies looking helpless to stop him before they made adjustments. He has a bright future and led their backs with 78-yards on 7 carries with a 47-yard run that raised a lot of eyebrows. UWW's other backs, Makaio Harn and Preston Strasburg, had moments and will probably rip apart defenses of lesser WIAC programs once they get through their monster non-conference slate. * Senior WR Tyler Holte made some good grabs for Warhawks, ending the day with 6 catches, no drops, with 100-yards and a TD. Sophomore Steven Hein also appears to be a solid target for the Warhawks. * QB Evan Lewandowski ended the day going 17 of 31, for 176 yards in the air with a single touchdown and interception. He got a few good runs in, but overall found himself corralled with the rest of the offense when the SJU defense stepped up. * The Warhawks defense made the SJU running game a complete non-starter (11 total yards on the day); however, they weren't able to stop them as well in the air. UWW was already known for their running defense. If they can tighten that passing defense, they will be exceptional. * Why was Tamir Thomas unused in the first half? Figure out ways to get him on the field more. * Work on snaps! Two safeties on those botched plays were unacceptable for a program hoping to find their way into the D3 championship race. * Next week the Warhawks host reigning national champions, No. 1 Mary Hardin-Baylor, who eliminated them from tourney in last year's semifinals. The Cru won their opener 62-13 yesterday. There's going to be no breathing room for UWW. **Saint John's observations:** * Senior TE Alex Larson is one of those D3 players who appears to have been overlooked by scholarship programs. His size (6'7, 240lbs), hands, and athleticism were all on display as he led the Johnnies in receiving with 84 yards on 9 catches, with 25 hard-fought yards after catch and 2 touchdowns. * Junior QB Aaron Syverson made some questionable passing decisions in the first half, especially in his first trip to the red zone: throwing into quadruple coverage and then an interception. His decisions improved over the rest of the day, ending 25 of 34 for 267 yards with 3 TDs and an interception. * WRs Jimmy Buck, Nick VanErp, and Matt Mohr gave Syverson a good mix of targets as the Johnnie offense began to rely heavily on the passing game in the second half. * The defensive adjustments by the Johnnies in the second half were impressive. Even more so as they quickly figured out how to stop the rejuvenated UWW running game that gashed them to open the third quarter. As noted above, the final seven drives by Warhawks only netted them 4 total yards. * The biggest concern for the Johnnies was the running game, which was stifled by the Warhawks. This might have been because of the level of their opponent, but any team that hopes to challenge for the D3 title needs to do better on the ground and find a couple of backs to open up their options on offense. 11 total rushing yards is alarming, even with 267 in the air. * SJU also has a difficult early schedule. Next week they host another ranked WIAC program, No. 18 UW-River Falls which handily won their opener at outmatched Elmhurst, 63-0.
