To free up storage on my Macbook, I deleted a bunch of files from the iMovie library, basically I showed the library package contents and deleted most of them, but after emptying the trash I realized that I wanted some of those projects back so I can edit them if I wanted to, but now in the main iMovie screen I just see black screens with "0s null," probably because I deleted their project files for good. Any help to recover them so I can edit them again? Thanks!
