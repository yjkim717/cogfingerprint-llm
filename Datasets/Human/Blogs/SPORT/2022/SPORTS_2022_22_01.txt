I'm down with a cold and my appetite is much less than normal. I'm also extremely sedentary lying in bed and sleeping more. Can I take this as a low cal win for a few days of barely reaching 1100 calories? My loss goal is 1300-1500 and maintenance is about 2100. I know this few calories is not a good idea long term but is a few days ok? How long before my body rebels and starts to hang on to fat.
