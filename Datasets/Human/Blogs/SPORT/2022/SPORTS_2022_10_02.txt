Tonight in the Q4 the Jazz collapsed suddenly and GSW ended the game with a 23-3 run. When it comes to crunch time we can see the Jazz only tries to get a switch and reply on Mitchell's individual ability. Gobert is once again neutralized during the critical time. In the playoffs the defense intensity is going to be like what GSW has done down the stretch and year by year we have been talking about Jazz's offense and defense deficiencies but over the past few years we cannot see any improvements on this. They are gonna disappoint a lot of people and a lot of teams would be desperate to face them in a playoff series.
