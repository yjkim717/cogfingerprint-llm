1. Have any of you ever gotten an OC or DC that was at Level 0? I got one on an Online Dynasty and I'm wondering if I'm just stuck. They don't gain XP points either. I've been playing this game since the day it came out that's a first for me 2. On online dynasty if you do too many instacommits there's a point where they'll set you back on all the recruits on the board. Does anyone know exactly what triggers this? (I.e. how many instacommits and when in the season?)
