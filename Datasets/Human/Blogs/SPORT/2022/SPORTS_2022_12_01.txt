Hi everyone - first time posting in this sub so I hope request posts are allowed. I play mainly rebirth, and am looking for the attachments on one of the pieces of floor loot - the purple Automaton floor loot named “Accurate AR”. I did a lot of googling and found nothing, found someone’s post in this sub that has a spreadsheet of blueprints but looks like it’s from regular warzone which has different ones from rebirth. I know this gun has the 75 round mags but other than that it’s hard for me to reverse engineer it.. can anyone help me out?
