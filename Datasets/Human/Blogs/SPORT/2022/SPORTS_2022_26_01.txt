It was great watching him ball out last night. I honestly don’t think I’d seen a single post game interview or press conference with him this season, though. When I watched him after the game I was super impressed. He’s so much more fluent now than last year. Shows raw intelligence and I’m sure a lot of hard work on his part. Respect.
