Note: This was originally a comment responding to \this([ post by u/mathwrath55 last night. It was a lot of math to do at 2:30 am for a comment 2 hours late, so I figured I'd give it its own post &#x200B; **TLDR: Looking at all of the different 15 seeds to come before we breach the 2100s, we can relatively confidently say that the 312 of them combined have a lower chance at a single title than the Peacocks do this year. In fact, Saint Peter's chances are likely more than 5 times better than the next 80 years of 15 seeds combined.** &#x200B; Here's the math: Teams this year: 1 (Go Cocks!) Championship odds: 1/222, according to FiveThirtyEight. Vegas has about 1/30, but they’re incentivized to match bettor perception, not necessarily be correct. Plus 1/30 seems really high, just eyeballing it, so I’m gonna use FiveThirtyEight’s number Teams the next 78 years: 312 Championship odds: ??? (this is what we want to find out &#x200B; &#x200B; The original question asked about 15 or 16 seed title odds, but we're gonna write off the 16 seeds altogether. Sorry to those Retrievers up in Baltimore, but the 16s are pretty much dead weight here. In all of their 144 games, they won once, good for 0.7%. Winning 6 games in a row even with odds that are, say, 5 times that good is 1 in 670 million. The 16 seeds will not have odds that are 5 times that good over the next 78 years, so let’s just… ignore them. It makes my job easier tbh So we’ll look at the 312 15 seeds. 15 seeds beat their 2 seed 6.25% of the time. Those teams see more success in the next rounds, but that’s at least partially a function of that small set being underseeded. I’m not gonna do variable probability for each round, because that’s hard and it's very very late, so let’s just assign a flat number for these teams winning a given game. This is kinda fudgy, especially since parity in college basketball has been increasing. I’ll be generous (I think), and say that the 15 seeds have a 12% chance to win any given game. This is higher than their first-round odds because at least half of their games are guaranteed to be against theoretically weaker opponents (Seeds lower than 2). So let’s roll with that. A team with a 12% chance to win any given game has 1 in 334,898 chance to win 6 in a row. That’s a 99.9997% chance that they won’t close out their run. That’s already enough to tell us that the Peacocks are our best bet, but let's make sure. We have 312 shots to hit that 0.0003%, which gives us odds of 99.91% that it WON’T happen, or **.09% (just about 1 in 1100)** that it will. That’s way way worse than the more conservative FiveThirtyEight estimate. Obviously I fudged a few numbers, but I probably fudged it more against Saint Peters than for them, so this seems like a pretty sound answer. &#x200B; Just to wrap that all up, the 2021-2022 Saint Peter's Peacocks currently have a shot at winning a National Title that is **at least 5 times better** than the rest of the 15 seeds in the 21st century combined. If Vegas's 1/30 odds are right, the Peacocks' chances are over 35 times better than the 80-year field. So can all the bluebloods just chill for 3 games? It'll be worth it, I swear. &#x200B; Extra Credit: We can reverse this process to figure out what odds our group of 312 teams needs to match Saint Peter’s chances. For 312 teams to have a 1/222 shot of winning the title, they need to have a 1/69,108 shot to win 6 straight games. That doesn’t sound too bad at all! Using our same simplification where each game has equal odds, our group would need to be able to win games 15.6% of the time. For some reference, ESPN estimated that Saint Peters had an 8.9% chance to beat Purdue today. Historically, 14 seeds beat 3 seeds at a clip of about 15.3%, so we could at least very plausibly see a team seeded in the teens win it all by 2100. Just probably the early teens. One last note, since I hadn’t actually mentioned it yet anywhere: in order for a team to match Saint Peter’s current 1/222 odds over the full tournament, they would need to be able to win games about 40% of the time, slightly more likely than the historic odds of a 10-7 upset. &#x200B; Let me know if I totally messed up this math somewhere (it was very late), or if y'all have any questions I didn't cover
