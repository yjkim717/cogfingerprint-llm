I wake up before sunrise after 7hrs sleep. I then get out of bed and drink some water. A few minutes after that water, I will begin the consumption of a massive smoothie I prepared the day before. Do I chug it? No, that would not be ideal. I consume roughly 40-50% of the smoothie then drive to the gym which is 6 minutes away. I park pretty far away from the gym door, which I'll explain later. While walking into the gym, I'm sipping on a beet root powdered drink. While I'm in the locker room, I'm still sipping this beet root powdered drink. The workout is 60-80 minutes, and I'm cognizant to ensure enough time to pass in between sets I perform. After the workout I get dressed and depart to my car. This is usually about 20 minutes after sunrise. As I walk to my car, which is far away from the gym door, I'm focusing to breath the fresh morning air into my lungs as this starts the recovery of the workout. Once I get to the car, I consume more of the smoothie and focus on getting as much bluelight as I feel is reasonable. I drive home and do some very light stretching as I finish off the smoothie. Then I drive to work. Any questions?
