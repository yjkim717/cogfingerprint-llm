Hey all! I am a first time home buyer and was wondering if this seems odd. My real estate agent recently sent me a buyer representation contract which states that I will need to pay them 2.7% of the home value on close along with a flat $500 commission. Is this common in Minnesota? EDIT: Here is some of the language from the contract itself. Buyer shall pay the broker, as broker compensation, 2.7% of the selling price plus $499.00 when Buyer closes the purchase. If the buyer purchases a property before the expiration of this contract even if the buyer does not use the broker's services. It says later in the contract that the buyer remains responsible to pay the portion of the commission listed above at the time of closing.
