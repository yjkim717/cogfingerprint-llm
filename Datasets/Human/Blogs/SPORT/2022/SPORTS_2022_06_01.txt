Obviously if Ben Simmons became a decent shooter he would be an unstoppable player. But that's very unlikely to happen, so is it really that bad when Ben Simmons doesn't shoot open jumpshots when he's a terrible shooter and likely to waste his team's possession? If he shot those he would end up being an inefficient player like Westbrook. I feel like his biggest issues are his terrible freethrow shooting and his lack of aggression in the playoffs. If he was driving to the paint consistently and shooting average on freethrows he would be a very effective player, even without a jumpshot.
