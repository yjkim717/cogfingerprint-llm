As an example, a humble comment may be, "I'm just one player on this great squad, we went out there and took the win, all my guys picked up my slack while I slowed down," while a self deprecating one would be, "Yeah I mean, I played awful out there, I don't know why none of my 3's landed, we're lucky to come out with a win because it looked like I'd never touched a basketball in my life, I can't do that no more, I can't suck like that."
