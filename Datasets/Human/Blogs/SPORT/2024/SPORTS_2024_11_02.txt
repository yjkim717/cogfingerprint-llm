I feel like we have all seen what the fans think (some like it, most hate it) and we have even heard what the actors thought (they were against it). But in all the years since, has anyone ever seen a creator/writer talk about the decision and if they have any regrets and/or would do anything differently about pairing up Joey and Rachel if they could? If they had 20/20 hindsight and knew exactly when the series was ending, would they have do things the same?
