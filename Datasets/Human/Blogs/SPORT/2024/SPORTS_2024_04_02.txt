In my last dynasty offseason I had three graduating seniors at WR, so I left some scholarships open so I could add via the portal. On the first day of the transfer portal, I was locked out every single TE, and every single WR except for one 3-star who I missed on. This is despite having a ton of open playing time at both positions, and a returning QB who just won the Heisman. This was frustrating because there were a ton of talented 4-star players who I couldnâ€™t even try to recruit. Is this a glitch, or did they decide to make it basically impossible to recruit the portal?
