Reprises are great. They can be really effective in a movie ("Part of Your World" from The Little Mermaid), a TV show ("Face Your Fears" from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend), or a stage musical ("Do You Hear the People Sing" from Les Miserables). But they can also be great on an album. For example, "In the Flesh" from The Wall, "You Never Give Me Your Money" from Abbey Road, "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" from Wish You Were Here, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", etc. What are the greatest reprises in music history?
