My team plays man to man defense and is having problems with teams that run 5 out offense. The other teams big will often stand on the wing or at the top of the 3 point line. Our big will guard them since the are good shooters. This leads to us having bad rim protection on blow bys. How can we keep our big man closer to the block without leaving his matchup completely open for 3? We tried switching the big man onto the other team's corner shooter but then that led to some easier post ups for the other team's big man.
