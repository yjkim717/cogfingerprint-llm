I mostly use Siri for reading and dictating texts while I’m driving. Siri’s tone and inflections is so robotic and un-lifelike it’s ridiculous. Years and years behind the Google assistant. Last weekend I asked Siri what direction my ceiling fans should spin in the winter in order to bring the warm air down. Response: I can’t do that for you in home. Mind you, I don’t have any devices set up in Apple home. The Google assistant told me that fans should spin clockwise in the winter.
