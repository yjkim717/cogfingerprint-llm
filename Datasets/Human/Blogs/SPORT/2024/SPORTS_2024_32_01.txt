**The #CobraKaiAward for Excellence in Mercilessness** has been going since 2018, recognizing the most cutthroat performance in each week's college football games. It includes all levels: FBS, FCS, D2, D3, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, ONEFAüá≤üáΩ and JAFAüáØüáµ to spotlight which team tosses mercy out the window and instead uses the opportunity to make a statement. Everyone's now in the post-season! Well, almost: While Japan's Div.1 is on a break ahead of the national championship, they still have lower division regular season games (including the final week of the Medical and Dental School Division) as they jockey for position in promotion/relegation games. All-in-all, less opportunities for shattering an outmatched opponent for the kind of lopsided results that earn Cobra Kai Award glory. #Week 15 winner: Without any team going completely unhinged, the Week 15 #CobraKaiAward for Mercilessness was one of the tightest races we've seen: The top-4 division finishers finished within 4 points of each other, including a 40-point blowout in the CUSA title game that only had a single-score spread, and a 42-point win in the D2 playoff. An ultimate winner emerged out one of the two junior college organizations, as the **Iowa Central Tritons** (5-6, 1-1) dominated the NJCAA DIII #3 North Dakota State College of Science Wildcats (9-1, 6-0), **49-6**, in the 46th Game One Bowl held in the UNI Dome in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Both NJCAA postseason games took place on *Sunday*, so good thing we waited. Their margins of victory were 42 and 43. *** ###The week 14 top scorer from each level, in order of margin of victory (defense is tiebreaker): * [**43**] NJCAA‚Äî[](#f/iowacentralcc-sheet4-row13-col02)**Iowa Central CC**, 49-6 over [](#f/northdakotascience-sheet4-row15-col08)NDSCS * [**42**] D2‚Äî#1 [](#f/valdostastate-sheet2-row03-col18)**Valdosta State**, 49-7 over [](#f/virginiaunion-sheet2-row01-col10)Virginia Union * [**41**] JAFAüáØüáµ‚Äî**Dokkyo Medical** (Áç®ÂçîÂåª), 41-0 over Saitama Medical (ÂüºÁéâÂåª) * [**40**] FBS‚Äî[](#f/jacksonvillestate)**Jacksonville State**, 52-12 over [](#f/wku)WKU * [**32**] FCS‚Äî[](#f/ucdavis)**UC Davis**, 42-10 over [](#f/illinoisstate)Illinois State * [**32**] CCCAA‚Äî[](#f/sanjosecity-sheet4-row09-col10)**San Jose City**, 59-27 over [](#f/collegesiskiyous-sheet4-row10-col06)Siskiyous * [**20**] D3‚Äî#1 [](#f/northcentral-sheet3-row02-col07)**North Central**, 41-21 over #16 [](#f/hope-sheet3-row07-col05)Hope * [**17**] NAIA‚Äî[](#f/grandview-sheet4-row03-col07)**Grand View**, 17-0 over [](#f/northwesternia-sheet4-row02-col10)Northwestern (IA) *** **Past weeks winners**: Note: Rankings from time of game.
