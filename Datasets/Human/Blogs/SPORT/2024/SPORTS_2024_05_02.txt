The potential MPJ trade got me thinking about this. Under the previous CBA you could afford to max key guys that were one way players or had some injury concerns and you could still be carried by star power. Under this current CBA it is much more difficult to do that. Other than elite offensive creators (Luka, Jokic) I wouldn’t max anyone that isn’t a positive on both ends and reasonably durable. Which Max or Near max players do you guys think are overpaid?
