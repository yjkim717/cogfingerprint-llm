37/m - 16st 2lb trying to get more serious with weight loss. Is there a "better" app to use for tracking cals? MyFitnessPal is the obvs one but I've seen another two in the app store with high ratings/reviews so just curious if anyone has any experience with them: - Calorie Counter + - UK Calorie Counter: MyNetDiary Ideally, which is better for tracking without needing a subscription. TIA
