been a solid weekend all in all, but found myself on a super unlucky run of around 11 games all of a sudde. i’ve played 2-3 stacks, multiple devil’s ruin/strand/wish-ender, and just come off of two in a row where both teammates failed to register even an assist let alone a kill. what do you guys do to re-motivate yourselves on a run like this?
