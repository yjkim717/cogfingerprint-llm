A few years ago I bought a pair of open back headphones. I really enjoyed the listening experience on them it really gave a sense of space and 360 degree sound. I think the right ear is damaged it cuts in and out a lot more than it used to and am thinking about getting a new pair. The pair that I had was the Grado SR80x. The one thing I didn’t find good was that they weren’t the most comfortable. I thought the spongy foam often made my ear itch. For the most part I used the headphones to listen to ASMR. One problem too is the need for an adapter to plug into my iPad Pro. I’m assuming they don’t make headphones like these with a USB-C right?? But my main question was does anyone have any recommendations on a new pair? Not looking to break the bank but could go for an upgrade over the grado SR80x.
