I always thought the 7-Series Long Version was BMW's answer to the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, Genesis G90 LWB, Audi A8L Horch, and Bentley Flying Spur. Even though the 2023 7 Series isn't offered in a long-wheelbase version anymore, it's still longer than the previous model, so I figure it still plays the same role. With all the chauffeur-oriented options (executive rear seats, extensive rear-seat entertainment, etc.), I'm puzzled as to why BMW doesn't offer a chilled drink cooler in the back like its competitors do. Is it because the electric version can't provide enough power for that?
