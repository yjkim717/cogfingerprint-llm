## /r/CFB Trivia Tuesday! ## This Week's Contest: ## Fall Standings/Questions ## Your Trivia Settings ## Rules Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by /u/bakonydraco, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/Davidellias, and /u/iamnotacola. Each week there will be five questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. You get a one point speed bonus for finishing in under 2:30. There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance. ## Last Week ### Individual 2 perfects last week, congrats to /u/jlucaspope and /u/CptCheese! /u/cajunaggie08 and /u/galacticdude7 have moved into the top 16 and are on pace for a first round playoff bye with just 2 weeks go to. ### Premier Tier |Rank|Team|Last Week |-|-|-|-|-| | 1 | Ohio State | 2 | 2 | Michigan | 1 | 3 | Georgia | 4 | 4 | Oregon | 3 | 5 | Oklahoma | 6 | 6 | Michigan State | 5 Duke has entered the Premier Tier. ### USC Championship Tier USC, Boise State, and Kansas lead the USC Championship Tier.
