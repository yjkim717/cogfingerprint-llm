Since college football began deliberately attempting a 1v2 bowl game each year in 1992 (with mixed success until the BCS in 1998) there have only been 3 years in which both teams were making their first appearance in the championship game: 1992 (by definition, since it’s the first year) with #1 Miami vs #2 Alabama, 1993 with #1 Florida State vs #2 Nebraska, and 2010 with #1 Auburn vs #2 Oregon. Each of the other 29 national championship games included at least 1 repeat participant Additionally, the 2023-24 National Championship Game joins the 2010 Auburn-Oregon matchup as the only title games in which both participants had a national championship drought of more than 25 years. Michigan last won a share of the title 26 years ago in 1997, while Washington’s last title was 32 years ago in 1991. 2010 saw Auburn enter with a 53 year championship drought, while Oregon still has yet to reach the promised land for the first time Edit: for the folks who are beefing with calling the 92-97 matchups “national championship games” (take it up with the history books, not me) tonight’s game is still only the 4th of the BCS era, the same number as when the pre ‘98 games are included. Previous games were the inaugural game in ‘98, Miami vs Nebraska in 2001, and (once again) Auburn vs Oregon in 2010
