Hey guys! I know this probably gets asked a lot but I was wondering what you think of these two islands. We went to Maui 2 years ago and loved it but wanted to go to one of the islands around here. Both my fianc√© and just want a laid back vacation sitting on the beach all day with the occasional snorkeling. Don't really care about night life or anything, just want a place right on or near the beach. Was just trying to decide between these two for better beaches and just relaxing. Much appreciated! Edit: we will be traveling in early January
