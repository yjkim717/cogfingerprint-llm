May be wrong but didnt the instruction for the babaâ€™s double points task about catching alex & eating the carrot say they must move no faster than a brisk walk? Baba was full on running to catch Alex. Was waiting for them to give him 0 for breaking the brisk walk rule but they never even touched on it.
