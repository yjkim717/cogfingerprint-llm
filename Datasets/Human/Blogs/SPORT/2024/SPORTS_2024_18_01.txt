Where/how does the writer from Hebrews gather their info on Melchizedek? Is there something that I am missing in the few verses we have on him? Is there another text we are unaware of? Or must we trust this knowledge came from the Spirit? I found this one resource that is helpful, but it still doesn't explain how the writer knows Melchizedek had no father or mother and had no beginning. &#x200B;
