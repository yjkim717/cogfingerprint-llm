Curious if anyone here is driving meaningful sales off of Pinterest. If so, would you be willing to share: * Are you doing it organically or paid? * If organic, how often are you Pinning? * If paid, what type of ROAS are you seeing? * Any tips / strategies you would recommend? * If willing - would you drop a link to your store and/or Pinterest profile to learn from?
