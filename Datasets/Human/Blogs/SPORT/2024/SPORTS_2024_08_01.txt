I was reminiscing about some of those early season games and how many late TDs or scores we seemed to allow in garbage time, so I got curious and looked back at the numbers. Context: I defined "garbage time" as having a lead of 2+ scores with <2 minutes left, or 3+ scores with <5 minutes left. Big NFL analytics guy Ben Baldwin defines it as 15+ point lead with <10 minutes left, so my definition seems generous. The parameters aren't perfect and have blind spots, but at a precursory glance it does the job. Anyway, the games: ----- ECU: 3 points (Down 30-0, FG with 0:05 left) UNLV: 7 points (Down 35-0, TD with 2:43 left) Nebraska: 7 points (Down 45-0, TD with 4:17 left) Purdue: 7 points (Down 41-6, TD with 0:18 left) Penn State: 7 points (Down 24-9, TD with 1:59 left. I realize how close the cutoff here is, but I made the definition prior to me looking at this, and Michigan had a 99.2% chance to win this game after the TD per ESPN win probability%, so I'm sticking with it) ---- Total: 31 points surrendered in garbage time, out of 156 points, or 19.8%. Michigan's non-garbage-time defensive PPG was 8.33. Out of curiosity I went back and compared 2023 Michigan non-garbage-time (NGT for short, I guess) defense compared to some other modern historical defenses using the same parameters, so to list a few: (ordered) - 2018 Clemson NGT defense: 11.7 points per game allowed - 2013 Florida State NGT defense: 10.4 points per game allowed - **2023 Michigan NGT defense: 8.3 points per game allowed** - 2021 Georgia NGT defense: 7.8 points per game allowed - 2011 Alabama NGT defense: 7.7 points per game allowed - **1997 Michigan NGT defense: 7.6 points per game allowed** The 1997 mention is mostly for fun, as the eras of football and schematic development are just too hard to compare to modern defenses, but against the 2010s' slate, 2023 Michigan stacks up very well. Some other fun defensive statistics about this season: - SP+'s second highest graded defense of the 21st century, behind 2011 Alabama.^1 - Michigan's 247 yards per game allowed in 2023 is the second lowest of the last 11 years (2021 Wisconsin is #1) - Michigan allowed 17 total TDs this season. They forced 27 turnovers. - One of four teams since 2011 to lead the nation in yards per game allowed and points per game allowed. And the only one not named Alabama. (Seriously. 2017 Alabama, 2012 Alabama, and yes 2011 Alabama). - Held or tied five teams to a season low in point scored. UNLV (7), Nebraska (7), MSU (0, lol), Iowa (0), Washington (13). - Held both QBs they faced in the CFP to their worst passer rating of the season. Jalen Milroe, 111.9; Michael Penix, 93.6). - Won National Championship 🏆〽️
