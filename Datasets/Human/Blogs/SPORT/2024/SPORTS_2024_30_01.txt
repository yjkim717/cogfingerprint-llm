I'm curious as to who outside of players on your local/favorite teams are recognizable to the layperson. I showed some photos of current NBA players to my wife, who does not follow basketball. For context, I'm a Jazz fan and we live in Phoenix. These are the players whose faces she recognized: LeBron James, Steph Curry, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Deandre Ayton, Chris Paul, Cam Johnson, Kevin Durant, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert Who do your significant others recognize?
