My daughter locked both her phone (iPhone SE) and her icloud account by forgetting the passwords. We've tried to use the self-reset system, but the icloud instructions get sent to her own icloud account (wtf?) and a text message gets sent to her locked phone. I've tried to contact apple support, but they send me to iforgot.apple. Which, again, sends texts to the locked phone and emails to the locked icloud. My wife is the parent on the account. But none of the options here involve sending instructions to HER icloud account. We can't change the trusted phone number (why the eff not?) and we can't get the reset instructions sent to email. What was the point of setting up a parent account if it's not usable? What do I do here? This is completely circular, it's been a week, and I am getting incredibly frustrated by the fact that I can't unlock a phone I'm paying for. As an aside, my genius bar does not accept password or unlock phone appointments. So my only option right now seems to be going back into the circle of hell that is the online support app. EDIT: the solution was to make use of a sample phone at the apple store. Took them two hours. This is solved. And I do recognize that I'm not the smartest guy around, but I have rarely felt so unintelligent as I did through this whole experience.
