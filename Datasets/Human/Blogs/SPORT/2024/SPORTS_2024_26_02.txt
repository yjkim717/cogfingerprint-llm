Our favorite Pokumon is a RFA this off-season. How do you think that plays out for him? Do we extend a qualifying offer? (I believe it would be \~$6M at 125% of this year's salary) If we don't or he doesn't sign, does he get an offer sheet from another team? If so, are we likely to match? Or is Poku likely moving on from OKC, opening a roster spot for one of our two incoming FRPs?
