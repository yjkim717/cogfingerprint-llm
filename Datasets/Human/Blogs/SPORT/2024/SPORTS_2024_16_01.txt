## /r/CFB Trivia Tuesday! ## This Week's Contest: ## Winter Standings/Questions ## Your Trivia Settings ## Rules Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by /u/bakonydraco, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/Davidellias, and /u/iamnotacola. Each week there will be five questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. You get a one point speed bonus for finishing in under 2:30. There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance. ## Last Week ### Individual #### Last Week Whoa. He has troub– kidding. But no one got a perfect score last week. As a matter of fact, no one got all five questions. Insane! ### Premier Tier |Rank|Team| |-|-|-|-|-| | 1 | Michigan | | 2 | Georgia | | 3 | Ohio State | | 4 | Oklahoma | | 5 | Texas | | 6 | Michigan State | Miami (OH) begins the season as the top non-P5 team and are in 7th place, tantalizingly close to the top six. ### USC Championship Tier |Rank|Team|Last Week |-|-|-|-|-| | 1 | UMass | | 2 | USF | | 3 | Illinois | | 4 | Marshall | | 5 | Cincinnati | | 6 | Houston | Since no one really made any sort of suggestions for a Tier name, it is just going to default to “USC Championship Tier” unless there’s a particularly popular suggestion later on in the season. FINALLY!!! Finally, there is a non-FBS in the Championship Tier. And there are two! William & Mary and Wisconsin-Eau Claire. The William & Mary Tribe are the higher ranked of the two, currently in 9th, while the Blugolds of Wisconsin–Eau Claire (awesome nickname) are in 31st. *Best of luck to all, and be safe!*
