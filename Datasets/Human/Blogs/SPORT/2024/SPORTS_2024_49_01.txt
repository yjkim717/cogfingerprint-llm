I've currently in charge of Southport on my current save, and in three years have taken them from mid table of Vanarama North to runaway leaders of Vanarama National League. Playing an exciting brand of football with a young team. In September Championship side QPR sacked their manager, and I threw my name into the mix. QPR were hovering just above the relegation places so hiring a manager who found success in the lower leagues would be worthy of taking a chance on. Instead I was passed over for the roll in favour of David Wheater, who in the game had no managerial experience and had previously been working as a coach for Stockport County, who at the time of his appointment were in the relegation places of League 2. &#x200B; One of the big issues I've had with Football Manager is it never seems to reward players for their achievements with bigger jobs. In the real world a manager doing brilliantly in the lower leagues would get a chance with a championship/lower Premier League club (think Nathan Jones going from Luton to Southampton) yet this never happens in the game.
