I think the criticism of Slaf has been pretty undue this year. Despite not looking great before he got injured, he was producing. He’s got the best plus minus on the team, and he proved that he can make a line better, as when he switched places with Dach, the second line became better and the first line has had less production. One thing we were told that the beginning of the year was that there would be steps back for Slaf, and that makes sense, but at 20 years old, he has proven he can be an effective power forward, and I think he should be used as such . He may learn to drive a line more individually in three or four years, but his forecheck game has returned over the past week or two, and right now, he needs line mates who can support his ability to forecheck and the quick passes he sees. I’m not worried about him or how he’s playing, but I don’t think he has proven that he can be the best player on a line and provide significant production. For 50+ games, he flourished as someone who supported parts of the play and someone who drove other parts of the play, and we saw a lot of growth with that last year. This year has been disappointing thus far, and I hope he doesn’t get a position where he won’t find significant success for too long. On the other hand, maybe this is part of the learning curve. Make him learn how to be the best player on a line and produce.
