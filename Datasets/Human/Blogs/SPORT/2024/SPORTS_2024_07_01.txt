I’m not sure how this plays below Ascendant level and people may have a different experience to me, but personally, the snowballing isn’t fun whichever side of it you’re on. Win the first engagement? You likely have special left over, plus the special the enemy dropped on death. The other team has zero. You also likely have a free shot at the neutral special crate, and can now use your special to control the special and heavy spawns. Lose the first engagement? The same, but in reverse. In games where I play well I sometimes have up to 10 special shots loaded, in games I don’t I barely see any. The utterly abysmal spawns compound the issue because if a teammate dies, they respawn on the opposite side of the map to where the fight is, ready to be picked off when their teammates lose the 3v2 they’re now in. On multiple occasions we farmed the one poor Guardian that kept spawning away from their team. Not one game I played since the change has featured a comeback (from memory). Appreciate the experiment, was willing to try it, but this ain’t it. Just reminded me how much everyone hated it in the dying years of D1.
