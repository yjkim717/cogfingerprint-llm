Hey little buddy. Some of us have been involved in this industry and lifting for a long time, some longer than you've even been alive. People were making these posts 18 years ago claiming the same thing. You really think we don't look at this shit and immediately know the truth? You're so young you don't even know how naive and stupid you sound. Always very funny to me seeing the mind of a child try to lie to people who have more years of fitness experience than you do being alive. It's hard for you to see this from our perspective since you lack knowledge and experience but just know you're only fooling yourself. You've embarked on a terrible journey of destroying your endocrine system before you're even 19. Keep it up and you'll have to be on test for the rest of your life. Making stupid decisions because you lack foresight and only think of you right now, not your future self. You took gear to achieve a physique You can get natty in 2x the time...You're just lazy and your mind has been so easily corrupted by social media norms that you think it's the only way. Acting like a pawn just allowing yourself to be influenced by social media to the point you're on steroids at the age of 18. What the fuck are you thinking
