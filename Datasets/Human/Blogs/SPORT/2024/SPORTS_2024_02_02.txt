Hey folks, Long time lurker but I donâ€™t post much. Iâ€™ve had hammocks in my home since I was a child and since I was 13 (Iâ€™m in my mid 30s) Iâ€™ve had a hammock in my room or home office. I asked here last week on info on spacing to hang a hammock from ceiling joists in a approx 8â€™ ceiling with exposed ceiling joists. Someone linked me the ultimate hang calculator which worked great. Here is the hanging beauty. She is a Brazilian cotton gathered end hammock which Iâ€™ve owned for almost 15 years now. The knotted up rope is temporary as Iâ€™ll be replacing it but Iâ€™ve used these eye screws in 3 different homes now, in both wall to wall and now ceiling only, and I have never had any issues. They are each rated over 500 lbs which should be plenty for just hanging (other activities at your own risk ðŸ˜‰). As long as you properly hit the middle of a stud and make the right size pilot hole these will hold plenty. Cheers folks.
