I want your take on this one since I’ve seen some people include it and others not. My argument being if Arquette counts as an arc then a similar batch of three episodes (film plus two cards) should as well? On a similar note I wouldn’t mind similar mini arcs to act as a break during a longer one. Imagine a Foley retirement in the midst of MEM.
