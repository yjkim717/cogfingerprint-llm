How did you help your asd toddler cope with the sound of other kids crying? My level 1 4 year old hates it and if my younger NT kid gets hurt and starts to cry, older son will immediately run over and try to hurt him. We've tried headphones and calm down time and breathing and telling him to cover his ears or go somewhere else but it hasn't helped that much. Any advice is welcome.
