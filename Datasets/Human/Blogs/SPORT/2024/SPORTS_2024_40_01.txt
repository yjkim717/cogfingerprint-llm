Hello everyone and sorry if this isn't the right place for this question. I did search around and couldn't find it. My family and I are visiting Italy in October of this year, and I'm pretty sure that Series A plays during the time we'll be there. I'm very interested in attending a match during my trip, so I'm wondering when the Serie A schedule is released (in general terms). I know it'll have to happen after the season due to pro/rel outcomes and stuff, but I'm hoping to check in when it's released to plan. Thanks in advance!
