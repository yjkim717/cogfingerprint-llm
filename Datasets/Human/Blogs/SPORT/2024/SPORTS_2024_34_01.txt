"Perfect Games" are defined by me as scoring a TD on 100% of a team's offensive drives before garbage time. Since 2007, there have been a total of 34 perfect games between FBS teams, including 10 against P5 defenses. 2023 featured 4 new perfect games. **Perfect Games on Offense** Team|Opponent|Season|Wk|Final|NG Final|Pts per Drive|Avail.

Offensive drive efficiency (ODE) divides offensive value by drives, offensive points per drive (OPD) divides points by drives, offensive available yards percentage (OAY) divides drive yards by available yards, and offensive yards per play (OPP) divides drive yards by plays. Final scores are linked to detailed possession splits, the complete record of unit scoring value gained and lost by possession over the course of non-garbage possessions in the game.
