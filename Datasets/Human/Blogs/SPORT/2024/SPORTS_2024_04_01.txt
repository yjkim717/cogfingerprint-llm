He said that the Lakers wouldn’t have been in the playoffs if not for the “made-up” play-in tournament. But that’s wrong. Of course Bill didn’t correct him because he hates the Lakers but Barkley emphasized this incorrect point like 5 times. 2021: Lakers were the 7-seed (would have been in without play-in) 2022: Missed playoffs 2023: Lakers were the 7-seed (would have been in without the play-in) Made the WCF 2024: Lakers were the 8-seed. Won the play-in game to get to 7. Would have been in the playoffs either way. I don’t think the Lakers are contenders, but the notion that the Lakers got “saved” by the play-in just isn’t accurate. If anything the play-in made it more challenging for them because they would have been in the top 8 already.
