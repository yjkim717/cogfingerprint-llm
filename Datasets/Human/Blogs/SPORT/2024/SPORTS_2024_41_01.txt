## Week 9 * Preseason * Week 2 * Week 3 * Week 4 * Week 5 * Week 6 * Week 7 * Week 8 * Football Version This is a series I've been doing on /r/CollegeBasketball for 5 years, and now /r/CFB for 9. The post attempts to visualize consistency between voters in the AP Poll in a single image. Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is not a measure of how "good" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on. Chandler Mack, Jay Tust, and Tony Garcia took Christmas off, but are back for New Year's, so we are back to our full complement onf 63 voters. I'll likely return to posting these on Mondays next week just after the poll comes out (if the AP site cooperates) Jay Tust was the most consistent voter this week. Justin Martinez is the most consistent voter on the season, followed by Sheldon Mickles, Kevin Brockway, Jay Tust, and Tony Garcia. Dylan Sinn was the biggest outlier again this week. He is the biggest outlier on the season, followed by Brian Holland, Dave Borges, Jeff Neiburg, and Luke DeCock.
