I’ve been running off and on for about five years. But I don’t really train, I just run about 40 miles a week, try to throw in a long run once a week, and I pretty much always just run at tempo pace. I’m gonna run a half marathon in June, and I set a goal pace (7:30) on my watch. I’ve used the coach training plans before, and I didn’t really enjoy those, but if I just follow the daily suggested workouts,is it pretty effective at getting you to a goal?
