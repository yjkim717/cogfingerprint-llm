This is inspired in part by those feel good stories about a family whose house is illegally foreclosed on and they obtain a writ against a bank branch. It seems to me that invariably they simply accept a check from the bank to satisfy the order. But do they have to do that? Let's create a hypothetical where somebody sues a car dealership and wins a judgment for a token amount, like eighty bucks. The car dealership doesn't make good on that, so after a while the complainant goes to the courthouse and obtains a writ of execution, and then they serve that on the dealership. In order to satisfy the judgment, could the complainant demand possession of, say, a car? Or can they only demand possession of something valued at approximately what they are owed? And if they can take the car, are they required to post a bond for it in case the dealership decides to appeal? Does the response to that answer depend on whether it's a summary judgment or not? Thanks in advance.
