For Iowa State, once again, it is our OL. Our OL has been utter garbage for going on a decade and a half AT LEAST and games are won at the LOS. The strength of our OL will determine if Iowa State puts up 7 wins or can actually make a run at the Big 12 Championship game/a possible playoff appearance.
