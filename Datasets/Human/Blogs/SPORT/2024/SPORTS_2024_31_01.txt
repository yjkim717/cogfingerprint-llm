This is not official, just an assumption based on the season finale episode. May change as a couple of weight classes had 3 progress, and a couple just had 1 progress, so gonna be a couple of guys moving up / down. Welterweight Title: Chris Thomas (c) vs. Emanuel Muniz Super Heavyweight: Dannie Van Heerden vs. Makini Manu Heavyweight: Brian Ellis vs. Logan Greenhalgh Light Heavyweight: Garrett Blakeslee vs. Eddie Brahimir Middleweight: Branden Bordeaux vs. Garrett Grimes Welterweight: Zach Zane vs. TBA
