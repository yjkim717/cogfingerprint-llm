Gophers are 327th in D1 in 3 pt %, 345th in FT% and 340th in per game scoring out of 364 teams. If it weren't for Dawson Garcia, we probably wouldn't have more than 2 wins so far this year. This team is uninspiring, boring to watch, and plays generally bad basketball. As much as NIL and free transfers are a huge impact, the inability that Ben's group has to simply coach guys up on basics like making free throws or jump shots is the biggest reason why he needs to go. If we're going to struggle to have talent because of NIL resources, then at least go get 2* and 3* kids who can be coached up, have some basic fundamentals in them, and have a basketball IQ above vodka freezer levels. Hopefully a new coach (whenever that happens and whoever it is) will be able to build a more entertaining product than what we've had for the better part of the last half decade.
