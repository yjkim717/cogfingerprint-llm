I am looking to get some cabinet brand recommendations for an outdoor kitchen. The kitchen area is on a fully covered second-story deck, but will be exposed to wind-blown rain, and is salt waterfront in the PNW. The current plan is an "L" shaped kitchen(approx 7'x10'), a 30" sink, a 36-48" built-in grill, a higher BTU side burner, and a variety of doors and drawers. Any direction is helpful, thanks!
