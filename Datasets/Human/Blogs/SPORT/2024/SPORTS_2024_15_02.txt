Not sure if we're doing a formal discussion thread for it or not, feel free to delete this if so lol I just watched it and *really* liked it. Pretty harrowing and visceral, maybe a little long but I think the catharsis it built to was definitely earned. Great acting from a large ensemble. Bayona is a pretty talented director, this one had some Cuarón/Iñárritu esque camerawork and he knows how to hit you hard with the "big" moments (i.e. the crash itself which is scary as hell) With all the shortlist love, it seems like a safe bet for an International Film nomination, and I think it'll get at least one tech nomination. If I had to pick one I'd go with Makeup/Hairstyling, it has all sorts of dirt, grime, chapped lips, blisters and scratches. VFX is a maybe, there's a lot of impressive work and the category is sort of all over the place so there's room for it if voters really like the movie. Not sure about Original Score, it's beautiful work from Giacchino as expected but they haven't nominated him since Up in 2009(!) and I'm still haunted by that Batman snub Anyone else who's seen it - what did you think?
