Texas College is a small private school in Tyler. The Steers are not good at football; I remember back when I went down to Fort Worth to profile the return of football at Texas Wesleyan, TC was the one team that seemed like a safe win on the early schedules. Former Oklahoma WR Jarrail Jackson (1995-99) opted to take on the difficult challenge in 2022. The first two seasons were difficult, 1-9 and 1-10 respectively, but they got some national attention for last season's opener: 96-0 preceded by 25-players being removed from the team bus right before the departed because the school administration had fumbled athletic certification with the NAIA. How do you, excuse the pun, steer the team back onto the right path? What kind of coach to do you need? Learn more about Coach Jackson here:
