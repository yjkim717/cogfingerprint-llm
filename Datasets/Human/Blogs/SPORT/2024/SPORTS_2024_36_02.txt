By my memory, there were two kids who were losing their brain power because of some supernatural reason, and I believe they had a math competition at the end of the week, or some sort of motivation for fixing their dumb brains (as if becoming essentially disabled isn't motivation enough). I specifically remember one of them saying, "I don't even know what 2+2 is anymore!" None of the Goosebumps books in the original 62 book run sound right, though - am I thinking of a Goosebumps book or some other book?
