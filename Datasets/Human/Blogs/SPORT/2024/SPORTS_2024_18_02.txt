I have been trying to a pan two guitars left and right, but have been having some issues that I initially though was with the individual track and plugin. If the track is panned either dead center or far left, I am getting sound in both speakers equally (no matter how far left it is turned). If I pan the track right, I get no output at all. This was happening no matter what I was doing with those two tracks. I have since found that this is happening on every track in the project. If far left > full output in both speakers. If far right > no output at all. So it's not the individual guitar track like I first thought. It's every track in the project. Any ideas on what could be the issue? EDIT: Just noticed that when panned to the far right, I'm getting reverb from one of my buses. If I mute that channel, I then have no output again. Just thought I'd mention that. EDIT 2: Okay I'm really confused now. If I open a brand new logic file and move one of those guitar files over, I'm having the same issue on the new project. i have no idea what's going on. FIX: I found out that the issue was that I was using AirPods because I was arranging some of the track at work today. Essentially, the AirPods were getting maxed out due to the microphone, so I went into audio settings and put the input to nine. That fix the issue. This is never happened before until today, but hopefully it helps somebody out in the future.
