As the title states, one of my gas lines has a blockage I’m guessing right at the end of the line where the burner sits over it. Burners 2 and 3 work fine but the burner first on the line will not light. Took the burner off and cleaned it and used air hose to blow it out. Still won’t light, when I feel the end of the line with my finger there is a lot of gummed up grease around it, I think the pinhole must be blocked, when I turn it on without the burner I don’t hear the hiss of the gas either. Are there some like cleaning wires I can buy for this?
