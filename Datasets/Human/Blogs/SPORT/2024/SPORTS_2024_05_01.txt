Context: I’ve been playing for about 10 years now. I’ve played a myriad of basses but like a toxic ex I keep coming around to a Jazz Bass. I play in Bar bands, ranging from Classic rock, Grunge, Motown, R&B. My current rig has been a Sterling Sub and a Fender Rumble 500 (2x10). My Question: I’m looking to upgrade my amp to a mid tier amplifier. I’m not looking for an SVT or anything just something a bit nicer than the Rumble. I don’t hate the Rumble but I don’t love it. I’m looking for something in the 500-700w range. As far as speaker size I’m undecided but I’ve toyed with the idea of building a 2x12 cabinet. I have played through Fender and and Peavey cabinets. The Peavy 4x10 was too heavy and too big. The 2x10 Fender had the clarity I liked but I felt like I was missing a bit of low mid/bass punch. The 15 lacked a bit of clarity. None of these cabinets were cheap but they definitely were top end. I am going to buy a Player series bass, I haven’t made a decision between the P or the J but it will be Seafoam green. I vasilate back and forth. I prefer the sound of the P but I’m missing the tips of two fingers so the jazz necks are easier to play. I can play both fine jazz necks are just more comfortable. If anyone has any recommendations of amps I should try out, cabinet recommendations(building or Buying) please comment down below.
