This entire process has been annoying. I had a good lawn and they came in to install the patio. There was a step from lawn to patio so I asked them to level it out. They ripped out almost 100sqft off my lawn and said they would seed it…in November. I said I’d have a muddy mess in my yard for 6 months so they put sod down. Issue now was the sod wasn’t level with the current lawn, so instead of just using sand to level, they put 3 way down, and I have a small strip of dirt between my lawn and sod. What’s the best way to make it look uniform? I aerated last spring. I’m thinking in March I would aerate again, and put down United Seed Super Turf II LS Tall Fescue-Bluegrass Blend all over the lawn to at least have new grass all grow in the entire yard. Is there an issue in doing this?
