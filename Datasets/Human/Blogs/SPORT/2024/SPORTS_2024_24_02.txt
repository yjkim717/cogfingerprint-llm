I cannot figure out why. I seem to get fluid tempo on take away and come down at a non-steep angle. Hit the ball flush on the club face (I’ve monitored using foot powder). my 4i goes 150-170 and my pitching wedge also goes up to 150. I’m proud of the fact I have taught myself everything and would like to find a way to diagnose this and fix. What should I look for?
