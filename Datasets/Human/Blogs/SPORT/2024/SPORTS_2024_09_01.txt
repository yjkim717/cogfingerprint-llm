I've always had the impression that the FIFA World Cup garners more attention for the sport itself, but the Olympics hold greater prestige for the host country. Is this assumption correct? I searched for answers on Reddit but mostly found comments suggesting that the FIFA World Cup is the largest and most important sporting event in the world. Is this really the case? The Olympics, with their wide diversity of sports, might have a more global reach. Large nations like the US, India, and China do not seem as interested in ~~soccer~~ *football*. Additionally, the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics, which are among the most-watched events, are significantly grander than similar events at the World Cup. This gives the hosting country a unique opportunity to showcase itself to the world. Furthermore, the Olympics usually require extensive infrastructure development, often resulting in some of the largest constructions in the host city or country. Olympic parks and villages often become integral parts of the host cities for decades, leaving a significant legacy. In contrast, apart from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the FIFA World Cup typically only requires the construction or refurbishment of a few football stadiums. Historically, many World Cup finals have been played in existing Olympic stadiums. Soooo...while the FIFA World Cup might have a larger global viewership, the Olympics remain the most prestigious events a country/city can host, right? However, I'm genuinely unsure. It would be fascinating to hear the perspectives of people from other countries on this topic.
