Week 16 is here, /r/NFL, and we're getting closer to Christmas and closer to the end of the season. We're now at nine eliminated teams, seven clinching playoff spots, and three of those clinching their division. Last week was an another good one for me, going 12-4 and bringing me to 150-74 on the season. I hope everyone got their holiday shopping done and are ready for some good game and possibly the Grinch visiting your team and stealing a playoff spot. We're looking at six divisional games on the list. We also have two Saturday games this week. Let's get to it! --- Winner||Loser|Comments -|-|-|- [](/DEN)Broncos|over|[](/LAC)Chargers|The Chargers have struggled recently, going 1-3 in their last four games, and the absence of Dobbins is still a significant factor. Over this span, L.A. has managed just 66.2 rushing YPG, highlighting their offensive challenges. On the other hand, Denver is on a four-game win streak, averaging 86.5 rushing YPG and thriving on a defense that’s forcing turnovers. If the Broncos' defense can continue to create opportunities, they have a strong chance to pull off the win in this matchup. [](/KC)Chiefs|over|[](/HOU)Texans|Will Mahomes suit up for this game? The oddsmakers’ decision to favor the Texans suggests they anticipate Wentz starting for the Chiefs. Houston is 4-3 on the road this season, with Stroud posting an 83.8 passer rating in those games. However, with KC still competing for home-field advantage, I assume Mahomes will play through the injury. If he does, this could shift the balance significantly, so this pick is subject to change based on his status. [](/BAL)Ravens|over|[](/PIT)Steelers|Baltimore has dropped each of Jackson's last four starts against Pittsburgh, including an 18-16 defeat in Week 11 where Jackson was held to just 253 total yards. Meanwhile, the Steelers have struggled with ball security, posting a minus-9 turnover ratio over their last five games, which includes road losses to Cleveland and Philly. While the Steelers might be a good pick to cover, the Ravens seem overdue for a breakthrough. [](/ATL)Falcons|over|[](/NYG)Giants|The Giants’ nine-game losing streak rolls on after last week. Atlanta enters this matchup off a short week and is 1-3 as a favorite, setting the stage for an uninspiring game. However, the Falcons remain in the NFC South hunt, while New York is 2-4 on the road, with all four losses being one-score games. A backdoor cover feels possible, but the Giants’ QB situation clouds their chances further. [](/DET)Lions|over|[](/CHI)Bears|Despite mounting injuries on defense, the Lions' offense continues to fire on all cylinders. Goff has been stellar, averaging 332.7 passing yards with 10 TDs and just one INT over his last three games. This game could also serve as a showcase for Lions OC. Expect Detroit to bounce back convincingly after a tough loss to Buffalo and solidify its spot atop the NFC standings in a decisive win. [](/CIN)Bengals|over|[](/CLE)Browns|The Browns' offense has struggled, averaging just 10.5 points in losses to the Steelers and Chiefs, and now Thompson-Robinson might start against the Bengals. Cleveland is also missing Chubb due to a broken foot, further weakening their attack. Meanwhile, Cincy is surging with playoff aspirations, as Burrow has thrown at least three TD passes in six consecutive games. The Bengals have dominated the Browns at home in recent matchups, winning the last two by an average margin of 15 points. [](/IND)Colts|over|[](/TEN)Titans|Both teams are coming off turnover-filled performances, with a combined 11 giveaways last week. Levis struggled with four turnovers in Week 15, while Rudolph had his own issues. The Colts were equally sloppy, committing five turnovers in their loss to Denver, including two INTs from Richardson. This matchup hinges entirely on ball security, and with both teams prone to mistakes, it’s likely to be a close, one-score contest. [](/LAR)Rams|over|[](/NYJ)Jets|The Rams have surged to the top of the NFC West on the back of a three-game winning streak, during which they’ve avoided turnovers and kept Stafford well-protected with just two sacks allowed. Meanwhile, the Jets remain winless as underdogs this season. Rodgers showed signs of life in his best game of the season, rekindling chemistry with Adams, but that alone won’t overcome L.A.'s superior defense. [](/PHI)Eagles|over|[](/WAS)Commanders|The Eagles are still in the hunt for the No. 1 seed, and their defense has been quietly dominant, allowing fewer than 20 points in five of the last six games. Barkley had a stellar performance with 146 yards and two TDs in the previous meeting against the Commanders, but he's nursing some soreness after last week. The question is whether Sirianni will reduce his workload in preparation for the postseason. [](/ARI)Cardinals|over|[](/CAR)Panthers|The Cards are still in the NFC West race, but they need to avoid slipping up against the Panthers. Carolina has struggled defensively, allowing over 200 rushing yards in its last three losses. This sets up a big opportunity for Conner, who has averaged 89.3 YPG in the past three weeks. Murray is expected to outplay Young, showing why patience is key for both QBs as they continue to develop. [](/MIN)Vikings|over|[](/SEA)Seahawks|Smith exited the Week 15 loss to the Packers, and if he's unable to play, Howell will take on the Vikings, one of the league's top teams with 40-plus sacks. Minnesota is 3-1 when favored by four points or more, and with Darnold continuing to be the hot hand, the Vikings could capitalize on the Seahawks' QB uncertainty. [](/BUF)Bills|over|[](/NE)Patriots|This is a significant spread, but the Bills' offense is on fire, averaging 41.7 PPG over their last three contests. Allen is in the MVP conversation, and Buffalo's high-powered offense is firing on all cylinders. The Pats have struggled, losing four games by 14 points or more this season and allowing 30-plus points in two of their past three matchups. Buffalo has won the last two home meetings with New England by an average of nine points. [](/JAX)Jaguars|over|[](/LV)Raiders|This game is all about draft positioning, with both teams struggling. Jones has thrown seven INTs in his last five starts, while the Raiders are dealing with constant QB changes. Vegas is also coming off a short week, which could further hinder their performance. Jacksonville has shown resilience, covering the spread in both games as an underdog of three points or less this season, making them an intriguing pick in this matchup between two teams at the bottom. [](/SF)49ers|over|[](/MIA)Dolphins|Both teams sit at 6-8, desperately clinging to their playoff aspirations. The Niners have been dealing with injuries, and their inability to establish a running game was evident in their TNF loss to the Rams. However, Miami has been solid at home with a 4-3 record and only five turnovers in those games, which could be the deciding factor in what looks like a tight contest. However, San Fran is likely to dig deep and show that extra fight to stay alive in the playoff hunt. [](/TB)Buccaneers|over|[](/DAL)Cowboys|The Bucs have the chance to spoil the Cowboys' playoff hopes in this pivotal matchup. Dallas has been riding a strong run game with Dowdle, who has averaged 130.7 rushing YPG over the past three weeks, and Rush, who has thrown just one INT in his last four starts. However, Dallas has struggled as an underdog, with only one win at home this season and a 4-7 record. Meanwhile, Baker has helped the Bucs string together four consecutive wins, and they remain in the playoff hunt. [](/GB)Packers|over|[](/NO)Saints|The Packers are in a win-and-in situation to secure a playoff spot, and they've been on a roll, covering in their last four games. Their upcoming matchup against NOLA could be a tough one for the Saints, especially given their struggles defending the run, allowing 135 rushing YPG over the past three weeks. That spells trouble when facing Jacobs, who has been on a tear with eight rushing TDs in his last four games. While Love has thrown seven INTs in six home games this season, he's been more careful in his last four starts. If Rattler starts and performs like he did last week almost upsetting Washington, this could be a good MNF matchup. **Playoff Picture with my predictions.** --- Those are my predictions, let's hear yours. Keep it civil and fun. Best of luck! **Update:** 10-6, on to Week 17.
