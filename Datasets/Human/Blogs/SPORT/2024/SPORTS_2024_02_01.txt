Stopped by the Apple Store and it doesn’t get past the charging screen even for them. They say it’s out of warranty and repair would cost almost as much as a new watch. Any other options besides buying new? It actually stopped working just shy of the year mark but my mom didn’t tell me about it until now (she thought it was the charger). Idk if it’s possible but in theory they should be able to see it hasn’t been turned on since then.
