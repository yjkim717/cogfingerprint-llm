I was there about five minutes earlier than the 5:30 showtime. Got in and it was playing the ads at the end of the pre-show. It played the Wolf Man trailer, then went straight to the Pepsi quote ad and then to the movie The usual at my theater is a 7-ish minute delay from the showtime before the trailers start, and at least 20 minutes after the actual showtime before the movie starts. This time the movie started at 5:40. Was kind of odd, curious of anyone else experienced anything weird like this or if maybe my theater just overlooked something when building the show for Joker
