Don't give a smart ass answer like the Clippers, Nets, or Blazers after the stars age or leave. In general a team that's making the playoffs for the next few seasons does not have the bleakest future. Some of the "rebuilding" teams won't end up in the playoffs even after their rebuild. Some tanks don't work. **Wizards** are a shout since they're fighting for the 10 seed with two star guards. Maybe next season will be different when Scott Brooks is gone if Westbrook is healthy from the season opener. **Bulls** are in a similar boat except they're probably stuck with their coach. They're much younger though. **Kings** always seem to be spinning their wheels. I guess they're tanking now? Fox is a stud and Haliburton looks like a nice piece, but other than that it looks pretty grim. Those two will likely keep their team from getting a high pick year after year but might not be good enough to make the playoffs in a loaded West. The **Magic** and **Pistons** were in limbo for a while but finally seem to have bottomed out. They could have successful rebuilds or they could stay in the gutter; tanking isn't a guaranteed path to success. The **Wolves** are always a shout. Maybe they'll turn it around with Finch, new ownership, and three top 2 picks. But they could also continue to wallow and I wouldn't be surprised. --- Honestly the **Rockets** might be my pick. Yes they have a haul of picks but there's no guarantee those picks will be valuable and no guarantee they'll draft well with those picks. They have a young stud in Wood but also the worst contract in the league that runs through the duration of Wood's contract. What's their plan with Wood next season? Are they building around him and trying to make the playoffs? Would they rather let him develop and maybe get some trade value? He's 25 which is a little old to be the young franchise centerpiece of a tanking team and I'd think he wants to compete. Also, Tillman might be the worst owner in the NBA.
