Jazz fans know all to well that Donovan is usually a great player for like 1-3 quarters of any given game. Some games he has an insane 4th quarter where he's clearly playing like the best player on the floor. Some games he's passing and shooting really well until the 4th and then he starts playing hero ball. Take the recent Sixers game. After 4 quarters, he had 31/8/5 on 48/55/66 shooting (only 3 FT attempts). Wouldn't mind seeing him get more FT attempts but that's squarely in the "good" range. But when the game is on the line, he has the tendency to panic and throw up terrible shots. In OT he was 2/0/1 on 0/0/66 shooting. He shot 3 twos and 2 threes, including 2 pull up shots and 1 stepback. He shoots 38% on pullups and 33% on stepbacks. What is he doing shooting those shots in OT with the game on the line? It's this sort of stuff that earns him the "inefficient chucker" label that he had started to lose earlier in the season. So how does he fix this problem? In my opinion, he's got to learn to trust his team and focus on playmaking. He has gravity when he drives. Use that and kick out instead of taking low percentage shots. Wait for the team to get set. The beauty of the Jazz is the system. Don't break the system when the chips are down. What do you think?
