Serious question, because to me the league’s policy on resting players is only being enforced very selectively - how are the Pistons not getting in trouble for not playing any of their best players down the stretch? Plumlee, Grant, Ellington, Joseph all have missed more than 50% of the Pistons recent games, and are literally listed as being out due to “rest” on the injury report. Didn’t the league just fine the Spurs & Raptors for resting players for one game recently? Yet the Pistons are doing this night after night without any mention of it? I thought the point of fining teams for resting players was to discourage tanking, yet the league fined two teams that have a chance at the play-in game and isn’t doing anything about the teams that are actually tanking. Seems like bullshit to me. I’m usually of the opinion that it’s dumb for the league to fine teams for resting players for a game every now and then, especially during a season like this where injuries are rampant and the schedule is super compressed. But the one time I think the league should actually crack down on a team over-resting players, because in this case it’s actually blatant tanking, and they look the other way.
