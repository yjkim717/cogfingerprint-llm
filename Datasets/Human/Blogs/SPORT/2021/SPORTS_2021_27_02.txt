Following his abysmal game against the Raiders, where he posted a 44.3 PFF grade overall and a 13.4 pass blocking grade, Villanueva looked really good back at LT. Against the Raiders he allowed 2 sacks, 3 hits and 5 hurries on 39 pass blocking opportunities. Against the Chiefs, he allowed 0 pressures on 27 opportunities. The 68 snaps Villanueva played at RT in Week 1 were the first time he had played RT since 4 total snaps (all run blocking) during week 2 of his rookie season in 2015.
