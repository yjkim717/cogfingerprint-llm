Welcome to Donuts! This post will follow the longest streaks without recording each major stat. **Field Goals:** By Minutes: Aaron Nesmith (27 minutes) By Attempts: Nesmith, Semi Ojeleye (10 FGA) Nesmith has appeared in 3 games this year, and was a promising bench guy for the Celtics in his rookie year. **3 Point Field Goals:** By Minutes: Jarrett Allen (210 minutes) By Attempts: OJeleye (10 attempts) Ojeleye attempts 65.8% of all his shots from 3-point land in his career. For his career, he's 34.2% to make those shots. That means the probability that he misses 10 consecutive tracys is about 1.5%. Jarrett Allen has put up 86 3s in his career. **Free Throws:** By Minutes: Royce O'Neale (181 minutes) By Attempts: Greg Brown III (3 attempts) It's really hard to miss a bunch of free throws. O'Neale has not even attempted a free throw. **Missed Field Goals (min attempts 1):** By Minutes: Jericho Sims, Trent Forrest (17 minutes) By Attempts: Joshua Primo, Trent Forrest (2 attempts) Extremely high turnover here. For some reference, the minutes leader last year was Pat McCaw at 33 minutes and the attempts leader was the immortal Udonis Haslem, at 2. **Missed Three Pointers (min attempts 1):** By Minutes: Richaun Holmes (166 minutes, 2 attempts) By Attempts: Gary Payton II (4 attempts) The Mitten has had 37 minutes so far this year, and boy has he made the most of it. **Missed Free Throws (min attempts 1):** By Minutes: Justin Holiday (214 minutes, 2 attempts) By Attempts: Bradley Beal (24 attempts) Beal has had a horrendous year this season shooting the ball, except from the line. He isn't in the 50/40/90 club, but he's currently in the 36/21/100 club. Interestingly two Grizzlies are in the top 5 in the by attempts stat (Jaren Jackson Jr and Steven Adams). **Offensive Rebounds:** By Minutes: Derrick White, Kent Bazemore (196 minutes) Neither is particularly surprising. Both White and Bazemore are very far down the list of people you would describe as "board men." **Defensive Rebounds:** By Minutes: Sam Merrill (28 minutes) This is good ammunition for the theoretical arguments about how an average Joe off the street would do in an NBA game. Given enough minutes, a basketball is going to hit you in the face. **Assists:** By Minutes: Brook Lopez (28 minutes) Semi gets the honorable mention at 25 minutes here. Semi, what would you say you do here at Fiserv Forum? **Steals:** By Minutes: Damion Lee (140 minutes) This actually surprised me a bit. Lee is by no means a thief, but he's had at least two seasons with at least a steal a game. I'd chalk this up to noise and would be more than a bit surprised if he's still here next week. **Blocks:** By Minutes: Cole Anthony (232 minutes) This doesn't surprise me that much. Blocks by guards are infrequent. I'll be keeping my eye on blocks though, to see if anyone can repeat 2020 Bryn Forbes' legendary 1,579 minute, 0 block season. 2021's leader, with 950 minutes and no blocks? Semi Ojeleye. Come on, man! **Turnovers:** By Minutes: Tyus Jones (86 minutes) Usually, the league leader in this stat is around 50-60 minutes. Impossible to keep this up, for obvious reasons. **Personal Fouls:** By Minutes: Danuel House (34 minutes) Shoutout here to Derrick Jones Jr., who has 3 blocks and a steal without committing a single personal foul. That's really hard to do! **Club Trillion Leader:** Joel Ayayi (4 minutes, no FGA/FTA/REB/AST/STEL/BLK/TOV/PF) **What have we learned?** Absolutely nothing.
