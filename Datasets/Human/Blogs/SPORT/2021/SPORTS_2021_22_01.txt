Hey spooky friends. This year we want to do a "garage monster" with eyes and teeth. I think this is cooler when the door itself is covered in black fabric so it looks like the void of a giant mouth. I've seen people do this with black trash bags but I don't like the look - what's the cheapest place I could source about 15' x 6' of mostly opaque black fabric? Thanks :)
