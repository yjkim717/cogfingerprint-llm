Things were hectic so I didn't get a post made last week. I was hoping to make this weekly or at least every other week. _____________ Workout of the Week is the place to talk about a recent specific workout or race. It could be anything, but here are some ideas: * A new workout * An oldie but goodie workout * Nailed a workout * Failed a workout * A race report that doesn't need its own thread * A question about a specific workout * Race prediction workouts * "What can I run based on this workout" questions _________________ This is also a place to periodically share some well-known workouts. **This week is Pre's 200s**. Thanks to /u/prairiefirephoenix for the suggestion. *History* > Technically, it’s not “Pre’s” workout. It was developed by his coach Bill Bowerman and became part of the “Oregon System” used by a generation of superstars. But Pre’s name is the one that will be forever associated with it. *What* As run by Pre: > It was simple, wicked, and fast: alternating 200s at 30 seconds, then at 40 seconds, either for a set distance, such as three miles, or until he could no longer hold pace. >Pre reportedly sustained this for 4.5 miles, a record that stood for years. Galen Rupp carried it to 6 miles. For mortals: > The fast 200s should be slightly slower than your mile pace, and the “slow” ones shouldn’t be a mere 10 seconds slower, but 33 1/3 percent slower. Thus, for a 6:00-miler running the fast segments at 45 or 46 seconds, the slower ones are all the way down to 60 or 61 seconds. *How* > The first time you try this, don’t worry too much about the distance. The goal is to find the rhythm. You can set a target distance if you want to, dividing it into sets, if need be, with a longer recovery between them, e.g., 2 sets of 6 reps, adding up to 3 miles. *Anyone use this one and what have been your experiences?*
