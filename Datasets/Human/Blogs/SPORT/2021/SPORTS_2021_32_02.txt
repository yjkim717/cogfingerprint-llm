We did the first seven /r/CFB Talks via Reddit's native "official app" version, all the while flirting with the idea of using Twitter Spaces (which Reddit Talk was modeled after). After seeing how well Oregon's coach search talks have done on Twitter Spaces, we decided to give it a try. Twitter offers the ability to record the conversation, which can be shared to further embarrass us. Welcome to /r/CFB Talk VIII... in *Spaaaace*(s)! Please join us. **The link will be posted here once it's live at 10pm ET.** You can listen on desktop, but to speak you need a Twitter account via the mobile app (so like Reddit Talk, *^^but ^^a ^^less ^^burdensome ^^app*).
