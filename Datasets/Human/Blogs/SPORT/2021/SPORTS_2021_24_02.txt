Hi all, We have Spectrum and their cable modem and I was going to add Google Fiber to test it out while leaving Spectrum up. My router has a dual WAN setting/setup but I am curious how well this actually works. I know mileage may vary but I am curious if anyone has any suggestions or caveats in setting this up before the Google guy shows up at my door next week. Thanks!
