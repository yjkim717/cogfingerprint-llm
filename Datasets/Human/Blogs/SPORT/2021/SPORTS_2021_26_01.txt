Even when I'm on a run with a great team, my ticket prices never seem to increase much on auto-adjust. Example: I just three-peated after a couple seasons losing in the finals. Hype has been at 100 for 9 straight seasons. And my tickets are priced #11 in the league. Every year, I'm dependent on a deep playoff run to make money if I'm flirting with the luxury tax. So, should I be adjusting my ticket prices higher to bring in more revenue? Or will it lead to selling out fewer games and actually reducing revenue?
