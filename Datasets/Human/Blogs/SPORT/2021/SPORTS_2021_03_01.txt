Happy Fall, /r/NFL! Today is the first day of Autumn; football weather is here! Hope everyone is enjoying their PSLs and getting all their decorations out. Go outside and enjoy some cool weather and leaves changing. Did everyone do good with their predictions last week? I was able to go 11-5 again, bringing me to 22-10 on the season. Post your results and your picks for this week. Week 3 gives us just four divisional matchups. Let's get to it! --- Winner||Loser|Comments -|-|-|- [](/CAR)Panthers|over|[](/HOU)Texans|Darnold and the D are overachieving, but that will continue in Houston with a good chance of facing another team with QB chance and a second rookie (Mills) in three games. CMC has a big night and the Texans are limited with their offense to pull a win against the Panthers. [](/BUF)Bills|over|[](/WAS)Washington|WFT will prepare QB Heinicke better for his second start of the season, but this is a tough place to play on the road against a Bills' defense that looks more complete and dangerous. QB Allen will need to worry about Young and Washington's D playing a lot better than Week 2. Allen needs a get-well game; this just may not be it as the Bills are better suited to keep up the run-heavy approach vs WFT. [](/CLE)Browns|over|[](/CHI)Bears|The Bears' defense showed its top form forcing turnovers against the Bengals at home. That scenario will be hard to repeat on the road as the Browns should push them around in the running game to open up more comfortable, efficient passing from Baker. He is likely to duel with Fields who will give this game a little extra local flair. Fields will face a tough pass rush while trailing in the second half and can only do much running to get the Bears in the game. [](/BAL)Ravens|over|[](/DET)Lions|Jackson has looked smooth with his running and passing when the blocking is there. The complementary traditional running game is rolling and the defense is still stopping the run despite its depletion and duct-taping vs the pass. Jackson, his backs, WR Brown and TE Andrews can all do whatever they want in this matchup to stay well ahead of Goff. Look for a return to bringing pressure and befuddling the Lions offense. [](/TEN)Titans|over|[](/IND)Colts|The Colts may be without Wentz and need to turn to Eason at QB. It doesn't feel like much of a downgrade or curveball to a run-heavy game plan. Indy's defense also has been wilting more than expected, giving big pass plays and not being as sturdy against the run. The Titans should like that combination as they can set up play-action for Tannehill well to play off RB Henry. But Indy will be desperate to avoid 0-3 and put up a tight fight by digging deeper in their passing game. [](/KC)Chiefs|over|[](/LAC)Chargers|The Chargers held off Washington but couldn't finish off Dallas. Here comes Mahomes and KC so they need Herbert to shake off some turnovers and be ready to duel. The Chargers' receiving versatility at wideout, TE and the backfield because of Ekeler will drive the Chiefs' D-backs and LBs batty. L.A. has been played good bend-but-don't-break defense for Staley and will stay in the game. But in the end, stopping both Hill and Kelce in key moments will be tough. [](/NO)Saints|over|[](/NE)Patriots| Most likely this will be seen like my Week 1 homer pick. But keep in mind, the Saints defense, even massively injured against Carolina, was stout against their run game. If the coaches are back from quarantine, and some key starters make it off the injury list, I think we'll see more of NOLA's Week 1 performance against the rookie QB Jones. Take this one with a huge grain of salt. [](/NYG)Giants|over|[](/ATL)Falcons|The Giants are looking for their first win and will get it while denying the Falcons a chance at theirs. This is a get-well game for the entire Giants' offense to come out and take pressure off QB Jones to carry the team as a passer and runner. The Falcons' pass protection is in shambles and Ryan is being forced into bad mistakes. This also feels like an opportunity for the real Barkley to show up in the rushing attack, coming off long-week rest. [](/PIT)Steelers|over|[](/CIN)Bengals|These rivals each had surprise wins in Week 1 over Minnesota and Buffalo, respectively. Week 2 came with a lot of regrets as the Bengals made too many offensive mistakes with Burrow in Chicago and the Steelers couldn't generate consistent passing with Big Ben vs Vegas. It's uncertain how many key bodes will be missing for the Steelers' defense, but there's no doubt the O-line is the biggest concern. Burrow will have some Carr-like success on the Steelers, but Big Ben should be able to lean more on rookie RB Harris here. This is a close game decided by a Heinz Field goal by Boswell. [](/ARI)Cardinals|over|[](/JAX)Jaguars|Battle of #1 picks. Murray hasn't been disappointing in year three with last season's shoulder issue behind him. He ran and passed to big things all over the field against the Titans on the road and Vikings at home. He just has to be careful about making big mistakes that offset big plays. There's no good sense that the Jags will stop Murray or any of the speedy playmakers around him. They also should be worried about the O-line crumbling big-time again. Until one can figure out what Urban Meyer is doing, stay away from trusting his team. [](/DEN)Broncos|over|[](/NYJ)Jets|Denver's defense has thrown down the way Fangio wants the last two weeks. At home for the first time this season, they will take down another overmatched offense in a loud home environment. The Jets also will face a Broncos' secondary that played much better in Week 2 leading to more mistakes from Wilson. Teddy will keep playing well to exploit a weak pass D with tons of help from RBs Gordon and Williams. [](/OAK)Raiders|over|[](/MIA)Dolphins|The Raiders have red-hot Carr driving all over everyone, making good use of top-flight weapons Waller and Ruggs III. But their running game and defense need to be better complementary units for any shot at holding on their winning streak. Carr has the big edge over Tua or Brissett here. Also look for extra juice in the Raiders rushing attack, with former Kenyan Drake getting after it as the key short-to-intermediate receiver in a "revenge" game. [](/TB)Buccaneers|over|[](/LAR)Rams|Probably Game of the Week. Stafford had a great first and a pretty good second game to ensure L.A. would start 2-0. But this is a different kind of measuring stick against an active defense that will shut down the run and come after him. He'll have to out-duel Brady without the same kind of depth at WR and TE. Brady will remember how the Rams got the best of him last year and won't let it happen again. [](/SEA)Seahawks|over|[](/MIN)Vikings|Wilson should have no problems roasting Minnesota's secondary with his wideouts and Cousins should be game to keep up in his team's home opener. Cook being a question mark hurts, because any less pop could make the difference. it's simply easier to trust a red-hot Wilson anywhere vs. Cousins at home. This feels like another wild one-possession contest for both teams, maybe coming down to a second OT game for each. [](/GB)Packers|over|[](/SF)49ers|The 49ers are struggling to keep RBs healthy and their passing game has more limitations than expected around Jimmy G. Their D-back seven also can be picked apart by Rodgers with decent protection. San Fran will try to get enough big pass plays so they can run to win, but the Packers should be inspired to compensate for the Week 1 road debacle against the Saints. Rodgers has another happy return to the Bay Area. [](/DAL)Cowboys|over|[](/PHI)Eagles|The Eagles looked dominant against the Falcons and then couldn't score on the 49ers. Hurts has played well, but their offense has been inconsistent with defense being the main strength. Dallas has shown plenty of diverse offense with Dak in two games and their defense is making up for big issues with takeaways and stops. Dak and Hurts will duel, with Dallas getting the key last possession at home. --- Those are my predictions, let's hear yours. Keep it civil and fun. Good luck! **Update:** 11-5, three weeks in a row! On to Week 4!
