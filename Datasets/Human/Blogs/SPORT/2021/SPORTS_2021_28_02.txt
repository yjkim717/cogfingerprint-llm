I have a leather jacket that I like a great deal, but there are two adjustment belts along the waistline where the buckle tongue is raised above the frame. When I walk my arms scrape the tongue and it's damaging the leather. Way I figure it, I can a) replace the buckles, which will probably exceed my capacity and expertise, (and also my willingness to spend), or b) get nylon caps for the tongues. So...B it is. But I do not know where to look - any advice? (x-posted to /r/leatherworking)
