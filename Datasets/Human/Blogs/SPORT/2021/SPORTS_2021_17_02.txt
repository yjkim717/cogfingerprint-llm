My wife has an iPhone 8 on our line with 3 lines. We went into the T-Mobile store to trade in for the iPhone 12 and we were told we’d get $765 for the phone, and walked out. What the rep forgot to do was to swap us to magenta max, and she realized it after I asked her before we left. She said, “Oh my goodness I’m so sorry, you’ll need to call 611. They’ll just fix it, and it’s only $15/mo more for your bill.” I call 611, and they fix the problem, but the rep told me the magenta max is for ALL lines and it’s $40/mo more. We’re currently on a corporate magenta plan that I get discounted, and don’t need unlimited 5G or personal hotspot use. The extra $40/mo negates the savings for the trade in after 10 months, and after that we’re spending more the phone bill than the actual phone trade in. I would’ve been better off trading the phone in at the Apple store and received an unlocked iPhone 12 Pro, and dropped the old phone off there instead of dealing with 611 reps (friendly) for almost an hour.
