## /r/CFB Trivia Tuesday! ## This Week's Contest: ## Fall Standings/Questions ## Your Trivia Settings ## Rules Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by /u/bakonydraco, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/GiovannidelMonaco, /u/Davidellias, and /u/KiltedCajun. Each week there will be five questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. You get a one point speed bonus for finishing in under 2:30. There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance. ## Last Week ### Individual #### Last Week Just five perfect scorers last week: /u/cajunaggie08, /u/hillbilly_dawg, /u/rabbichase, /u/toms47, and /u/52hoova. Another 15 users got all of the questions right but werenâ€™t able to get the time bonus. #### Season Notes /u/GeauxTri has slinked their way into sole possession of the top scorer of the season with 37 out of 42 points. /u/JeremyJammDDS and /u/CambodianDrywall join the top 16 users in line for a first round bye in the upcoming playoff. In other playoff news, nine users have clinched spots in the playoff. This means that 246 spots are still available for the playoff. ### Premier Tier |Rank|Team|Previous| |-|-|-|-|-| | 1 | Georgia | 1 | | 2 | Northwestern | 2 | | 3 | LSU | 4 | | 4 | Michigan State | 5 | | 5 | Oregon | 10 | | 6 | Ohio State | 9 | Penn State and Texas A&M were the two teams to drop out of the top 6. They fell from 3rd to 9th and from 6th to 10th, respectively. USF continues to hold onto the top non-P5 spot and they made up some of the spots they lost the previous week, rising from 19th to 17th. The sole team to join the Premier Tier ranks is Stanford via a ten spot climb from 46th to the 36th (and final spot) in the Tier. ### CJK5H Championship Tier |Rank|Team|Previous| |-|-|-|-|-| | 1 | Cincinnati | 2 | | 2 | Utah | 1 | | 3 | Duke | 3 | | 4 | Louisville | 5 | | 5 | Baylor | 34 PT | | 6 | Virginia | 7 | Two squads are out of the top 6 from last week. Temple slipped from 4th to 9th, and Maryland descended from 6th to 10th. St. John's (MN) is still the top non-FBS team and held steady in 7th. The one and only new team in the Tier this week is Boise State, who went from 2nd out of the tier to 35th. Tier namesake SMU still resides in 20th in the Premier Tier. *Best of luck to all, and be safe!*
