I'm kind of out of the loop when it comes to NASA programs and I'm by no means an expert on any of this stuff. So please correct me if I'm wrong, but from the information I could gather online, I'm pretty sure that: \- SLS will always cost more than any commercial option. (Even if Starship fails, breaking up bigger payloads and putting them on Falcon Heavy or maybe Vulcan/NewGlenn in the future will be much cheaper) \- despite its much higher cost, SLS is barely more capable than an expandable Falcon Heavy. Edit: This is wrong; I had old Information in my head when I wrote this post; sorry. \- SLS will only launch a few times a year, making a permanent presence on the moon almost impossible. \- there's a good chance that at some point in the future Starship will be significantly cheaper and overall more capable than SLS. \- SLS development was delayed (again). The first test flight will probably happen in Summer 2022. This gives Starship even more time to "catch up". \- because of the lacking capability of SLS, NASA is relying on Starship to land their astronauts on the lunar surface. So let's get this straight: *Without the success of Starship, NASA won't be able to land people on the moon. But if Starship works as advertised, there's no reason to pay for expensive flights on SLS.* It seems to me that NASA is currently pouring absurd amounts of money into a rocket that will essentially be useless after only a few flights. &#x200B; This begs the question of *why NASA doesn't just skip Artemis I and invest more money in Starship?* This would allow for faster development of Starship and a lower cost and higher cadence of missions to the moon. Utilizing more commercial providers for Artemis makes the goal of achieving a permanent human presence on the moon much more achievable. But the US is still a democracy, so *I'm interested in how US politicians justify spending so much taxpayer money on this program.* I often read that it's a jobs program, but I don't see why all these talented people currently working on SLS, shouldn't be able to get a job on some other project. Especially now with all the exciting new startups around. A few years ago, I also saw an argument claiming that SLS is essentially a backup in case Starship encounters major problems during its development. But now that the success of the SLS program relies on Starship, this argument seems to be obsolete. **So what are some of the redeeming qualities of NASA's SpaceLaunchSystem?** &#x200B; &#x200B; Btw. sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. (What's correct: redeeming qualities in SLS or of SLS?)
