Hi everyone, We are purchasing a home that currently is heated via two different systems: 1) A forced air system that heats a living room, kitchen, and master bed and bath (2 zones). 2) A high efficiency radiant heat system (boiler) which heats a dinning room, 2 bedrooms, a finished attic, a bathroom, and some hallway space (4 zones). Right now it is not in the budget to expand the forced air to the entire house, specially since the radiant heat is a new high efficiency one. But what we want to do is be able to control the heat for these 6 zones without having to walk to 6 separate thermostats all over the house. Is there a system where we can have "thermometers" in each of these zones which connect to one central interface that can control each of these zones? I am hoping for something wireless which wouldn't require me to re-run wires all over the house.
