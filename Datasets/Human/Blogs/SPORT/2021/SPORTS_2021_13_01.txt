Like the title says. Last Tuesday my wife said the car was making a knocking noise. Got it home. Talked to local dealership. I hadn’t had the knock sensor work done, I wasn’t ever notified of that. I am the second owner. Dealership didn’t think much of that. Said to get it to them. They’d perform the knock sensor update and then it would need to kick out a certain code and they’d submit to Kia. Got a call this morning from dealership saying it did fail and kicked out the right code. But since I didn’t have the knock sensor update done before the knocking started, they wouldn’t cover it. Dealership estimate for the new engine was about $7k. My issue is, I was never notified about having the knock sensor done. When I search my Vin for recalls it doesn’t list the knock sensor and something that needs done. I live about an hour away from dealership so I’m not visiting them for routine things like oil changes, etc. I called the Kia hotline and talked to someone and when I gave them my Vin, he had the wrong name for the current owner. I said how could I be contacted by Kia if you don’t even know who current owner is. Anyone been in a similar boat?
