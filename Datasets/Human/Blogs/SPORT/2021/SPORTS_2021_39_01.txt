I recently built some raised beds and ordered soil for them from a local dirt/bark/gravel place. I didn’t think about looking at the soil before I placed the order, but I wish I would have now. The soil I ordered was their garden mix, described as “Mostly compost blended with sand and loamy soil”. It seems like it’s bark and sand, it was very heavy, and when watered the water pools on top, runs off the surface, takes many minutes to soak in, and when I dig down a few inches after it has soaked in in and holds too much water. I am concerned this will cause some issues for my plants, both with watering and growing conditions. Outside of dealing with the soil company which I’m going to attempt. What are some other options to remedy the soil I have?
