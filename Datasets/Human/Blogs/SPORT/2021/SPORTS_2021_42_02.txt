Link to stats Smith is known as a player for being the starting point guard for the Houston Rockets' two title teams in the mid 90's as well as the runner-up in the 1990 Slam Dunk Contest. Kenny is also one of, I believe, two players (along with Dame Lillard) to participate in both the 3 point contest and Slam Dunk contest in the same All-Star weekend. Smith participated in the '93 3 point shootout and dunk contest. Smith's best season as a pro came in '91 - averaged 17 and 7 while shooting 52% from the field. That was also the year Hakeem was out for a chunk of the season - Smith averaged 20.8 PPG in March '91 (Hakeem was back in the lineup in early March so the scoring spike was not because of Hakeem's absence).
