Their franchise player and #1 pick is injury prone and overweight, and he may want to leave soon. They have the worst record in the NBA currently even though they have 2 all-stars on their team (Zion is out but still). Even last year with Zion and Ingram playing they still weren't close to the playoffs. They lost Lonzo in free agency for nothing and replaced him with someone worse. They wasted a lot of assets making bad trades and signings, and every coach that signs there gets fired fast. Sure teams like the Pistons are bad but they don't waste young talent and assets like the Pelicans do.
