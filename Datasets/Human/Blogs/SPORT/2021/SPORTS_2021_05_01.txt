I want to learn 5 or so different metas, And I’d like to know what civs pair with those metas for ease of learning. They can be varying levels of complexity. Any suggestions about when to get techs relating to those would be appreciated as well. For example: Frank’s—> scouts into Knights Britons——> archers—-> crossbows—> longbows—-> profit. (I get wrecked by this civ and can’t play it lol) Some background about me. I’m an 800 ELO player, I’m pretty good at eco, and I understand the game mechanics and techs pretty well. Currently my offensive gameplan has been what’s holding me back. I’ve mostly learned the game playing Byzantines because they do everything but cav archer well but aren’t great at anything. I’m looking to move into playing with new civs. My multitasking between scouting and eco in feudal game needs some work, but from what I understand learning some good metas will yield better results till I hit about 1100. If you guys could also put mass requirements for the metas for when you should attack that would be great. Ex: build 7 scouts before you attack. Thanks Edit: some metas I’m interested in but lost on are monks, seige, and infantry, tower rushing, I’m sure there are others I don’t know about but you get the point. Situationally I know how to use seige to counter castles/towers/ destroy buildings.
