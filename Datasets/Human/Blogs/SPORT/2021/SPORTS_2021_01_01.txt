Hoping someone can help - for some reason my daughters worlds aren't loading, likewise she can't access the marketplace. I don't have this issue with my sons account, and as the Xbox Live account holder, my profile is signed in? This xbox isn't set as home as another is, but like I said, when I'm signed in too it works on my sons but for some reason not my daughters. I can't see any settings that I'm missing but grateful for any help/ideas. Thanks in advance.
