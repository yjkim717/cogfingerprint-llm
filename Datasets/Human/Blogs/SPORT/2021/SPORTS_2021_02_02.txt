We planted (ALOT) several variety of carrots from seed in the first week of May (new purchased home so as early as we could). The planted both in a raised bed garden with good bagged soil and in a long row which we turned over the soil and amended with some compost, sphagnum moss, etc. On both locations the carrot leaves have grown nice and lush but when we pulled a couple you can see what looks like a carrot but still way too small and thin. We are approaching or have approached the stated time in the packets so the question is... how much will carrots realistically grow from this point forward? I know we dont get 8 hours of sun, maybe closer to 5 with partial sun the rest (large trees block most in the morning). Could it be that with less sun it it would take much longer but we still get some form of harvest? At what point do you know that it wont grow and you should just pull it? For reference, between both of the locations, our tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, bell peppers, jalapenos, radishes, etc. have all grown pretty well.
