So i have a load of burberry scarves for sale. Someone messaged me asking would i sell a bundle of 10 together. I replied asking what ones they were after and price etc, they replied with a phone number. Would you guys just ignore it? I know ebay can ban you if they find out you do deals outside of ebay.
