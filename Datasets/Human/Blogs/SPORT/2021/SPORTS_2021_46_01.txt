Mahomes pretty much rode the bench his entire first year, racking up only 284 passing yards and 0 passing touchdowns. The records for those, after one season, are 4,374 yards (Andrew Luck) and 31 touchdowns (Justin Herbert). So Mahomes was "way behind". But, as we know, he's extremely good. But is he good enough to close that gap? After two seasons, the passing yards record is 8,196. After three seasons, it's 12,957, and so on. See the linked graph. As it currently stands, Mahomes put up 14,152 yards in his first four seasons (2,266 behind the record) and 114 touchdowns (28 behind the record). I extrapolated Mahomes' next six seasons, using his current yards per game (307.7) and touchdown passes per game (2.478), assuming that he plays all 17 games each season. This has Mahomes overtaking the passing yards record after seven seasons and the passing touchdowns record after six seasons. What say ye? Is Mahomes going to "catch up" at some point?
