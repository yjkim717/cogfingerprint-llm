So KOC reported that Thad Young is not available via trade, as the Bulls value his veteran presence and playmaking abilities too much to sell him for anything short of an obvious overpay. Not only is this good news for Thaddy owners because it greatly decreases the chances he moves to a team where he's forced into a lesser role, but it also seems to signal that his usage &amp; minutes will be steady for the rest of the season since the importance of his playmaking abilities is being publicly recognized by the team. Additionally, there are reports that OPJ may be a potential buy-out candidate. With all this in mind Thad has to be a strong hold for the rest of the season, and it seems likely that his current production will continue indefinitely, barring an injury or a major slump. For a guy I snagged off the waivers, I'm thrilled. Anyone else excited about Daddy McThaddy?
