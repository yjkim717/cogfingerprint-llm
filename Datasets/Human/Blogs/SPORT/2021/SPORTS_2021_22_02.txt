I try to read books about the various milestones our toddler is reaching or supposed to reach. I've skimmed through several Montessori books and love them all but many activities either my kid isn't ready for or isn't interested in. I want to keep presenting opportunities for him to try things he's physically and mentally capable of like drinking out of an open cup or using utensils or other things that babies can't do but toddler could be capable of. How do you keep track of all the things you want to present to your toddler without making a second job out of researching toddler milestones? Any favorite apps? Visual guides I can stick on my fridge? We didn't try letting kiddo drink out of an open cup until today and he nailed it! It made me wonder what other opportunities I should be presenting to him, like sweeping or cleaning - (he doesn't pick up his toys yet and I would love to learn how to instill this desire in him). Any advice welcome :) Edit: our son is almost 18 months with a slight speech delay
