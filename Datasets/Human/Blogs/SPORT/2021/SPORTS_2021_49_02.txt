Simply question really. Is there a ball park figure in your head which helps you define a video as a success. My channel has around 42,000 subscribers, so I take anything more then half that as a video which did well. Do you have a similar number and if so what is it. I bring this up since my recent videos have been doing around 6-7k, and while I admit I've been covering some more niche videos I wonder if people are starting to tire of my content. Issue being I don't really know what to change up since the comments I get remain supportive.
