It is obvious he probably won't get it due to voter fatigue and his previous playoff performance. But looking at it from an objective standpoint I think he is arguably the most valuable player. He's averaging 28 12 6 shooting 55% from the field while being one of the best defenders in the league. He's 2nd in win shares and 2nd in VORP. The Bucks are 3rd in the East, only a game behind the Nets, and Giannis has barely missed any games. So Giannis fulfills the MVP criteria of good stats, good team performance, and high on court impact.
