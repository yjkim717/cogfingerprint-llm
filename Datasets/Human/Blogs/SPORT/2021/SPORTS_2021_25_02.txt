A little background: I play tennis and surf some tennis "sales" sites every now and again, mostly to buy a case of balls or research a racquet for a friend looking for advice. Today, while at least 10 meters from my phone, I got into a detailed conversation about court surface and watering issues (twenty years ago, I ran a club and know this sort of stuff....). However, my browsing history has nothing to do with court surfaces, materials, watering techniques, etc. However, tonight while reading news (NYT), there was an ad about tennis court maintenance and materials. I am in that situation where I believe two things which are in direct contradiction with each other: 1. There is no way my phone, which was 40 feet away and in a bag could recognize my speech, nor is this related to anything I have spoken about in any other context in years, and what I was talking about....and: 2. This is way too big of a coincidence for it to not be directed based on my conversation today as this is way too esoteric of a subject to get an ad on, even if you are a tennis player Which one is it: coincidence or my phone was listening?
