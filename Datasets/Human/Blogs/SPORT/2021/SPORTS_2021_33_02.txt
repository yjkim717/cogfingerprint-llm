Basically the title. Now, all moves with 70 or less power get the 50% boost from Technician. For reference, the fully evolved mons that get Technician are: Ambipom, Breloom, Cinccino, Grapploct, Hitmontop, Kricketune, Marshadow, Mr. Mime, Persian (both forms), Roserade, Scizor, Smeargle, Toxtricity and Scyther (Not technically fully evolved, but still viable) Significant moves that now get a 50% damage boost include Sucker Punch, Volt Switch and U-Turn, Ice Fang, Fire Fang, Thunder Fang, Skitter Smack, Shadow Claw, Night Slash, Psycho Cut, unboosted Facade, unboosted Knockoff, Parabolic Charge and Venoshock. There could be others. A few things jump out to me right away. The first is Marshadow, with access to a boosted Sucker Punch, Knock Off and Low Sweep. Low Sweep could replace Close Combat if you didn't want the defense drops, and Sucker Punch could fill the priority that Shadow Sneak previously did. Knock Off could provide good coverage even after its first use, or Skitter Smack for the SpA drop. Scizor also seems to get a solid buff, with U-Turn getting a massive boost and Knock Off retaining it's boosted BP even if the item is already removed. I could see a scarfed set wreaking havoc with U-Turn. Psycho Cut, Cross Poison and Night Slash also could now be used as strong coverage moves. Toxtricity could also see a boost, though I'm not sure it would rival its Punk Rock set. The boost to Volt Switch would help as a pivot, and theoretically a \~98 power Parabolic Charge could provide significant recoverability All in all, I could definitely see Scizor jumping to a viable spot in OU, and Marshadow gaining more ground in Ubers. Anything else seem like a sizeable buff for these mons?
