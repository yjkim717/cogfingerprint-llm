## /r/CFB Trivia Tuesday! ## This Week's Contest: ## Intersession Standings/Questions ## Your Trivia Settings ## Rules Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by /u/bakonydraco, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/GiovannidelMonaco, /u/Davidellias, and /u/KiltedCajun. Each week there will be five questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. You get a one point speed bonus for finishing in under 2:30. There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance. ## Last Week ### Individual #### Last Week /u/Inkblot9 is the one and only user who got all six points in last week’s meta week. Another three got all of the questions correct, but not quick enough for the time bonus. ### Team |Rank|Team| |-|-|-|-|-| | 1 | Ohio State | | 2 | Notre Dame | | 3 | Georgia | | 4 | West Virginia | | 5 | Michigan State | | 6 | Michigan | ### Georgia Alternate Flair Georgia fans, expect a message sometime today that will include a survey to select UGA's alternate flair. The results will be revealed next week. ### Championship Tier Name St. John's (MN) earned the right to name the Championship Tier for this season. It’s a bit of a mouthful, but the tier will be named the “Ordinary Redditors Doing Ordinary Trivia Extraordinarily Well” Championship Tier. Also known as the ORDOTEWCT. *Best of luck to all, and be safe!*
