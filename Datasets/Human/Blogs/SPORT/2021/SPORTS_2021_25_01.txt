I apologize if this seems crass. This is just an issue I’ve dealt with for three winters now and I haven’t found a solution: During the winter months, I run outdoors mostly. My limit is usually zero Fahrenheit but will sometimes hit the treadmill on an especially windy day. The normal running temp from December to March is probably usually between ten and thirty degrees F and I usually run 60-75 minutes. I have really only been running for two or three years, and I have yet to find away to keep my genitals, particularly the end of my penis, warm. Boxer briefs ride and scrunch up and just generally don’t fit, and I put the shorts under my running pants, but that’s usually ineffective. I also am on the larger side down there and even with the cold shrinkage, my penis feels really exposed after 30-45 minutes of running. I normally will have to stop a few times and hold it in my hand to warm it up. For reference, I’m pretty cold adapted and usually don’t wear or need hand, ear or face protection (excluding Covid) to keep those parts of my body warm. The last 30%of my penis is by far the most trouble and it is extremely painful. Just looking for suggestions or products that won’t affect comfort while providing warmth.
