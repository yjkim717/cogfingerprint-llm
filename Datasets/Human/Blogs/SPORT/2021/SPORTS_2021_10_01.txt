Reading the news saying AGC will not take any actions against the woman who made false accusations against the doctor makes me frustrated. With the use of Internet, literally people can spread rumors and even ruin one's reputation by spreading these false accusations, especially spreading those related to sexual assault since it attracts attention. What can we, as a citizen, and what can the government do to prevent others harm by those with such malicious intent? Imo, these incidents will only lead to more and more distrust between people (esp of opposite gender), which is a ticking bomb for the society.
