## Week 6 * Preseason * Week 2 * Week 3 * Week 4 * Week 5 * Football Version This is a series I've been doing on /r/CollegeBasketball for 3 years, and now /r/CFB for 7. The post attempts to visualize consistency between voters in the AP Poll in a single image. Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is not a measure of how "good" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on. Poll newcomer Jay Tust was the most consistent voter this week. Kelly Hines and Jeff Call are still the top 2 this season, followed by Jay Tust, Sheldon Mickles, and Terry Toohey. Jesse Newell was the biggest outlier this week. David Jablonski, Jesse Newell, Dave Borges, Jon Wilner, and Rick Bozich remain the 5 biggest outliers on the season, in that order.
