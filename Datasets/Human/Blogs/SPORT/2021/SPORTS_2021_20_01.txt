Everyone says hippies and frat boys are on season 9, but... BJ & Tyler were 20-somethings that weren't even alive in the 60s Eric & Jeremy dropped out of college Meanwhile in season 13... Anita & Arthur wore tie-dye shirts and were definitely alive in the 60s Andrew & Dan actually went to college and were certainly members of a fraternity I rest my case.
