It feels like even most Jess-Rory shippers don't love their possibilities for long-term romance at the end of AYITL (Jess is "too good" by then). So let's assume they don't end up together. But even as a Jess-Rory hater like I am, that does not mean that I want Jess to be miserable or alone his whole life. So a project for all of our Jess fans: **Create the ideal "soulmate" for a 35-40 year old Jess.** *Who is she? What kind of person is she? Where did they meet? What does she do? What do they do as a couple? Are they going to get married and have kids or something less 'traditional'?* Maybe a fun/easy way to do it would be to "transport" other characters (or their traits) from other entertainment (TV, movies, books, etc) that he would fit well with as an adult.
