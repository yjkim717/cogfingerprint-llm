Here's a complete list of Lions head coaches, years, and post-DET records, starting with the end of World War II: Name | Years in Detroit | Post-Detroit record (teams) ---|---|---- Gus Dorais | 1943-1947 | 0-0 Bo McMillin | 1948-1950 | 0-0 Buddy Parker | 1951-1956 | 51-48 (PIT) George Wilson | 1957-1964 | 15-29 (MIA, AFL) Harry Gilmer | 1965-1966 | 0-0 Joe Schmidt | 1967-1972 | 0-0 Don McCafferty | 1973 | 0-0 Rick Forzano | 1974-1976 | 0-0 Tommy Hudspeth | 1976-1977 | 0-0 Monte Clark | 1978-1984 | 0-0 Darryl Rogers | 1985-1988 | 0-0 Wayne Fontes | 1988-1996 | 0-0 Bobby Ross | 1997-2000 | 0-0 Garry Moeller | 2000 | 0-0 Marty Mornhingweg | 2001-2002 | 0-0 Steve Mariucci | 2003-2005 | 0-0 Dick Jauron | 2005 | 24-33 (BUF) Rod Marinelli | 2006-2008 | 0-0 Jim Schwartz | 2009-2013 | 0-0 Jim Caldwell | 2014-2017 | 0-0 Matt Patricia | 2018-2020 | 0-0* Darrell Bevell | 2020 | 0-0* Robert Prince | 2020 | 0-0* \* indicates there have been no seasons since leaving Detroit No former Detroit head coach has had more than 1 head coaching job since. Fun fact number 2: Since the end of World War II, the Detroit Lions have had 23 head coaches, of whom 19 were full-time. Of those 19 coaches, only 4 have winning records in Detroit since the war, and only one since 1972 (Jim Caldwell). Fun Fact number 3: The Lions' best coach by winning percentage since 1972? Gary Moeller, interim head coach in 2000, at .571. I heard this on Philly talk radio last night around midnight and had to verify it myself. This is a big oof.
