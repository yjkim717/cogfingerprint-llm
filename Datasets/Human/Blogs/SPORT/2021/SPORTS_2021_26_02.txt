Nothing I’d love more during our rebuild than to see Russ lead a miraculous deep playoffs or championship run. That said, I’m glad George Hill landed on a true contender. He wasn’t here long but he was an absolute professional, played well for us and mentored the young guys while he could. Thanks, George- and good luck!
