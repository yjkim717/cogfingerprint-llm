Not counting anyone still being paid to win games (current players/coaches/owners), who is your favorite person in sports? It could be an announcer (like Gus Johnson or Romo), could be a podcaster (like Big Cat or Bill), could be a TV person (like Barkley or Uncle Tony) , could be a journalist (like Woj or Shams). Your choice. Does anyone pick Bill still? Which years would you have said Bill in the past?
