I really love the cover of Springsteen's "I'm On Fire" by Chromatics. I'm a big fan of Chromatics in general but I would love to find other electro/synthpop songs like this one that are a little more chill than their more upbeat stuff, have soothing vocals, etc. Any other artists/songs I should check out?
