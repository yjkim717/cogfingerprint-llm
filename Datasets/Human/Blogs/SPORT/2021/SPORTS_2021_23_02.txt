I would say Iowa State but our history begs to differ. The team I think of is Oklahoma State. They unfortunately will always be second fiddle to OU and have a tough recruiting area to cover against the likes of OU, UT, Baylor, TCU, Tech, and A&M. With that said, I am still shocked that they can't seem to get better recruiting classes. Mike Gundy has been one of the most consistent coaches and you can almost always depend on the Pokes to be in the T25. They have very nice facilities to boot, so I am not quite sure what the disconnect is with the top recruits and coming to Stillwater.
