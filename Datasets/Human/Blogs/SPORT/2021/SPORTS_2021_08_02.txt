I know we're so focused on Georgia, but fuck, I cannot stop rewatching highlights of the OSU/Iowa game. We finally did. We broke the ceiling, #2 in the nation, 12-1, **Big Ten Champions**. I honestly cannot believe it; our best seasons of the last decade and a half (2006, 2011, 2016, 2018) always fell short in some way or another. But we finally did it, sooooo happy to be here right now. But yes, Beat Georgia.
