**tl;dr:** My first strongman competition. Took 5th in the Novice Class. I had fun, got some PRs, and met the best /r/weightroom mod. **Background** I'm 41, 6', and ~210lb. I've been in and out of the gym for the past 10 years, but I consider my training age to be 4 years as that is how long I've strung together consistent training now. Training over that time went from GZCL templates > Renaissance Periodization physique templates > 5/3/1 BBS/BBB > Stronger by Science 2.0 > 5/3/1 BtM > and then a short stint on SBS Hypertrophy. **Training** At the beginning of the year I decided to see how the other half lived and hired a coach, knowing I had this comp in my future. I pretty much divested myself of any and all thinking and decisions in this regard. "Tell me what to do and I'll do it." I'm told it's a mix of block and linear periodization, for whatever that is worth. Main lifts were programmed off a training max and I'd give each session an RPE after completion. Accessories were 3-4 sets of 8-20 reps depending on the exercise, starting at ~3RIR and progressing weight over the meso. Two squat days, two bench days, one deadlift day. Deloads every 4-6 weeks. Pretty standard, boring stuff. Diet wise I am/was on a slow bulk throughout. Probably too slow as I'm only up 10 pounds since Jan 1. No special protocols, but aiming for 3400 calories (TDEE is ~3200) at 205/375/150 P/C/F since May. Much of this time was pre-vaccine, so I was lifting in my home gym 5-days a week. In spring I emerged from my mRNA cocoon and trained in a real gym two of those 5 days. **Meet Prep** In May we switched things around and started Strongman Saturdays. First meso was with comp lifts to get a baseline and then ran a couple mesos with variations and/or bringing up weakpoints. So, log instead of axle presses. Deads on a barbell and not the axle. Lots of back work. Then in mid-August (8 weeks out) we moved back to the comp lifts for a peaking cycle. Here I was often given an RPE to work up to, rather than a given weight I had to rate. For example "work up to a double at 8RPE" or "370 @ RPE9". Two weeks out I ran a mock competition, sans truck pull, and then tapered and deloaded from there. Outside that I still had two squat focused days and two bench focused days. I thought that last part was weird so I asked, and coach told me weakpoint training stays the same during prep, and my bench is weak so he had me there. **Competition Day** Did you know novices don't weigh in? I didn't. So instead of weighing in the day before, I just asked my noob questions since I was there, like "how long will this take?" and "what, exactly, are Wessels' rules?" I weighed myself at 209.6 on my bathroom scale the day of. There were 12 others in the Novice Class and it was a diverse group of dudes in size and experience. **1st Event - Axle Clean and Press** Wessel's rules: Axle weight makes 10lb jumps, you get three attempts but if you miss one you're out. 90% of my anxiety about this competition was wrapped up in this event. It's the one lift I personally care a lot about but is also the most technical. And I'd never live down getting out-pressed by u/trebemot. I hit 232 in the gym with a near miss at 238, so I had planned to go 215/225/235. 225 is something I wanted to hit in competition and that would have set me up for PR attempt, even if a small one. But I had spaced out that "miss and your out" rule so I got nervous about messing up. Then all these big dudes started jumping in at 155/165 which really surprised me and ...I just had to get in there. I went 195/215/225 making each pretty easily. Can't be mad about hitting my goal weight so smoothly, but 235 won the event. But, one of the spectators (someone's dad?) told me I had good form so I got to have a Lifter B moment. Tied for 2nd in the event **2nd Event - Axle Deadlift for Reps** Novice men got to choose from either 385 or 425. Each rep at 385 was worth one point, each at 425 worth two. I stressed over this decision for quite a while but after some test runs 425 was less fatiguing to rep out then 385, and pulling the heavier weight is just more badass anyway. I pulled 420 for 7 in the gym with one in the tank so I figured 8 would be a good showing. I ended up getting 10 for 20 points total. Tied for 3rd in the event **3rd Event - Truck Pull** 14000lb truck, 75 feet. Best time wins, distance completed if time runs out. I went into this event completely blind. I didn't train for it at all. Everything I know about this event I learned in the 20 minutes before it started, listening in on other people giving tips. While the ladies were going first, I found myself next to another competitor's wife who gave me tips (she sits in the truck when her husband practices) and kept giving me positive affirmations like "just remember you can do it". It was really sweet. Got it done in 37.6 seconds. I don't know that I've ever had tunnel vision this severe. I don't really remember any part of those 37.6 seconds except for a blur of rope and concrete. It was a very weird experience. 7th place on this event. **4th Event - Farmer's Carry** 215lb per hand, 50 feet down 50 feet back. I'd done this weight once in the gym ~60' down and back right after deadlift amraps and it was awful. I knew this was going to be awful. Before the event we were all talking about how awful this is going to be. The comp handles had no knurling like the ones I trained on, and I'm pretty sure they were thicker. It's going to be awful. I'm wrapping my hands around the handle thinking how awful it's going to be and I take off expecting it to be awful and ...it's not awful?? Holy cow this is actually pretty easy! I think I can really open it up on this return lap! Ended up getting a too little eager on it, lol. Despite the spill I got 24.9 seconds, but that was enough to set me back in the placings again. 7th in this event **5th Event - Atlas Stone Series** 4 stones 175/220/250/275 over a 52" bar. In the gym I mostly worked with a 178 and 223 stone. I attempted and loaded the 232 once. The next stone up was 286 which I also tried once but didn't even lap it. I felt like I was good for 250 and 275 would have been gravy but I wasn't going to be upset if I missed it. Ended up struggling more with the 250. Lost some control getting it over and grabbed onto the bar which was the one thing we were told not to do. So I dropped it and got it on the second attempt, which cost me some seconds. Finished in 47.7 seconds. The 275 stone felt easier somehow, but there seemed to be a the sentiment that it was the easiest stone out of the bunch, however that works. 6th in this event **Final Thoughts** Ended up in 5th place overall. 1.5 points away from 4th and 3.5 away from a spot on the podium (if novices even have one). I didn't come into this competition expecting or even really trying to win. I just wanted to get my first one on the books for the experience, hit some PR's, and maybe make some dudes work harder for it. I feel like I ticked those boxes. Despite the gaps in training and the mistakes that cost me some seconds, I feel like I had a *really* good day. I PR'd 4 out of 5 events and had a great time doing it. I felt like I could hang with the more experienced or bigger dudes in my class, even if I was bringing up the rear. Looking forward to the next steps.
