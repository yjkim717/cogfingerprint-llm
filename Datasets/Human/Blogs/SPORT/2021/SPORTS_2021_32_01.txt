Reddit Talk is an opportunity for the /r/CFB Community to talk CFB! It's a bit like radio, very similar to Twitter Spaces, and native to Reddit. We agreed to take it on in its early stages because an exciting future AMA (which we can't wait to announce) will be using this format. We've been pleased with how it's gone taking your calls and hearing your thoughts -- it ends up sports fans are more ready to do this than other subreddits. Tonight we're doing our 5th /r/CFB Reddit Talk and we've got a little more experience with this (still being developed) Reddit product and feel more comfortable announcing like this ahead of time. Time: 10pm ET / 9pm CT (That post goes live when the talk is open) Topics (we start with a little discussion then dive into calls): * /r/CFB's Visit to Wazzu, Idaho, and the Brawl of the Wild with /u/RiffRamBahZoo * The Latest CFP Rankings * Coaching Carrousel * Tuesday Night #MACtion * Any CFB Goings On * **Your Calls, Your Thoughts, Your Questions** They keep adding features, so use the updated version of the Reddit App (and iOS if you use an iPhone) to get the full experience. The admin team working on Reddit Talk has been good about making fixes based on how these go on /r/CFB and the other subreddits testing it. *** #How Does It Work: **Reddit Talk on r/CFB!** How to Listen: Open up the Reddit App on your phone and head to /r/CFB! The Reddit Talk post will be the first sticky. **Currently, Reddit Talk on desktop is listen-only.** *If you want to be able to interact with the hosts, you will need to be on the Reddit App.* *If you are only able to listen on Desktop, feel free to ask your question or make your comment in here, and one of the hosts will bring it up.* * What is Reddit Talk? * Other Reddit Talks?
