Hello Just wondering if there's any major pros/cons between wired or wireless headset. I'm looking to upgrade my Stealth 500x (wireless via a receiver) so just looking at possible options & whether or not the additional cost for wireless is actually worth it. I've got Dolby Atmos and I'm assuming it'll work regardless of wired or wireless. Thanks in advance.
