Week 10 Donuts: Attack of the Tendays The Donuts have never had such an insurgency of fresh meat before these past couple weeks. COVID has been a terrible thing for the NBA and the world, but it makes for some fresh donuts! **Field Goals:** By Minutes: Derrick Walton (31 minutes) (TEN DAY) By Attempts: Marko Simonovic (7 FGA) (NO CHANGE) Elijah Hughes fell to 4th on the list – he didn’t play last week, and 3 irregulars entered the fray. Derrick Walton gets special mention here: he’s played in 1 game, a start, and he delivered 31 minutes of scoreless b-ball. Simonovic added 2 garbage time misses to his scrapbook. **3 Point Field Goals:** By Minutes: Rudy Gobert (1025 minutes) By Attempts: Justin Champagnie, Petr Cornelie (7 attempts) (NO CHANGE) Gobert’s lead has widened to over 100 minutes. Hasn’t attempted a trey in over 3 weeks. **Free Throws:** By Minutes: Denzel Valentine (180 minutes) By Attempts: Alfonso McKinnie, Ish Wainwright (2 attempts) (TEN DAY) B-Ball Paul logged 15 minutes last week, but it wasn’t enough, as the heartbreaker himself stormed into the Donuts lead. Denzel Valentine is perhaps my least favorite of the moribund Bulls teams. The clip I will always remember him by: McKinnie is the first player this year to have a ten-day converted into a full-season contract – he took the place of Alize Johnson and promptly entered H+S protocols himself later that same morning. **Missed Field Goals (min attempts 1):** By Minutes: Jericho Sims (80 minutes) (NO CHANGE) By Attempts: Jericho Sims (6 attempts) I honestly think Jericho Sims has the most impressive stat line among ANY player in the NBA this season. He just added 23 minutes of basketball making 2 more shots without missing any. He’s done so by being extraordinarily picky. No player in the NBA attempts fewer shots per minute than Jericho (min. 1 attempt, obviously). Only Nerlens Noel is kinda close among players with at least 300 minutes – and he’s not actually very close. This absolutely won’t go on, but Sims deserves some credit: if you assume he’s 50/50 to make each shot, this is a 1/64 outcome. **Missed Three Pointers (min attempts 1):** By Minutes: Tristan Thompson (419 minutes, 1 attempt) By Attempts: Trevor Ariza (4 attempts) The miss by Willy: Though to be honest, it would not have mattered: Thompson dropped in his only attempt of last week and drowned Willy in minutes played. Anthony Gill is still battling perfection, but Trevor Ariza came back from his injury and got hot right away. Ariza promptly went on the H+S protocol list. **Missed Free Throws (min attempts 1):** By Minutes: Robert Covington (887 minutes, 3 attempts) By Attempts: Frank Ntilikina (19 attempts) Tre Jones played it safe and didn’t attempt a free-throw last week – he falls to #2 on the list. The French Connection played 105 minutes in his last 3 games (COVID is a hell of a thing) and went 12-35 from the field and 7-7 from the stripe. **Offensive Rebounds:** By Minutes: Markus Howard (116 minutes) (NO CHANGE) **Defensive Rebounds:** By Minutes: Joe Wieskamp (16 minutes) Even covid protocols aren’t going to make this list very big. Rebounds just…happen. 113 minutes among eligible players now. **Assists:** By Minutes: Moses Brown (120 minutes) Moses must be proficient at parting defenders, because he thinks he’s always open! \*ZEKE NNAJI CORNER\* Zeke Nnaji had no assists last week. The best of the season remains this one: ** **Steals:** By Minutes: Rodney McGruder (110 minutes) Robin Hood Lopez had himself a nice little double-double and this “steal”: The ball is literally given to him. Come on, man. **Blocks:** By Minutes: D.J. Augustin (433 minutes) Tomas Satoransky has one of those impressive blocks where he is a) on the ground after trying for a block on a shot is not attempted and b) blocks the ball on a shot where the ball is not above the waist of the shooter. I’m doing the rest of this week’s Donuts under protest. **Turnovers:** By Minutes: Matt Thomas (68 minutes) (not as nice) Both McBride and Primo played and lost the ball last week, so Matt Thomas is the new #1. I’m mildly surprised he’s still on the Bulls roster and Alize Johnson isn’t, but they must want “shooting,” and Matt Thomas is consistent there (3-11 from deep, 3-11 from shallow). I don’t get it. **Personal Fouls:** By Minutes: Damyeon Dotson/Chaundee Brown Jr. (21 minutes) (TEN DAY x2) I don’t think I’ve ever heard of either of these guys, so I’m going to do one last Langston Hughes poem in honor of Galloway’s exit from Donuts. Hold fast to dreams For if dreams die Life is a broken-winged bird That cannot fly. Hold fast to dreams For when dreams go Life is a barren field Frozen with snow. **Club Trillion Leader:** Arnoldas Kulboka (3 minutes, no FGA/FTA/REB/AST/STL/BLK/TOV/PF) What have we learned? Absolutely nothing.
