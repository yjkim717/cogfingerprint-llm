I've just got the 5 Stone deluxe version of the classic Lansky Sharpening System. I've got several questions: 1. How do I clean my hones? The normal stones (up to 600 grit) can be cleaned by applying a little bit of honing oil on the surface (I read that in the instructions). But what about my ceramic and sapphire stones? How do I clean them? 2. Do I have to use leather oil on my leather strop? 3. How to I apply stropping compound on my strop? 4. I just regrinded the bezel of a really thick knife. How long will these stones last and is it bad when I sometimes slip from the blade or ram the tightening screw against the clasp?
