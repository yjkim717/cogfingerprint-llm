As we see more and more discussion over how good (or in some cases), not good Jeff Gorton was as a GM, there are some moves that need to be put into context. &#x200B; You see a lot of people claiming that he rebuilt a roster in three years, or pointing out that this team is young and full of talent. Then you see people who are more critical of Gorton, often pointing out that luck had a lot to do with that, and it did. We were lucky twice to move up in the lottery, in 2020 from 10th to 1st and in 2019 from 6th to 2nd. On top of that he was able to acquire Fox for two seconds, Panarin at a discount and Trouba (a trade for an RFA who wanted to be here) because of the logo and location of this franchise. &#x200B; People who are either critical of Gorton, or just are less loyal to him than some of his "In Gorton We Trust Fans" are fairly quick to point this out. &#x200B; However the people who criticize Gorton, often bring up the Kreider or Trouba contracts, and luck has made those look worse. Right after the trade deadline, it was reported that the Salary Cap was expected to go up between 84M and 88M for the year 2020-21 (source). And it was expected that going forward, the cap would continue to increase as the new TV deal got negotiated. Then COVID hit and stalled the cap growth, and the Rangers land Lafreniere in the draft. With the cap going up considerably, Kreider's cap hit as a very good number 2 LW isn't a bad contract at all, and with the cap continuing to rise, the 7 year commitment was as bad either, and you can always buy out a contract at the end of the deal/make a trade. All teams carry long-term contracts on veterans to where they aren't worth their value at the end of the deal, you can't expect to build a roster and never have a contract that will age poorly. The problem is COVID hit and made cap issues more immediate, and I'm not going to blame him for not seeing that coming.
