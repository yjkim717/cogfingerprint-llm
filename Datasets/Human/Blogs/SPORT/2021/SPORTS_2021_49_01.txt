I'm going through my regular relistens to the OSW back catalogue (It's a great way to get through the office days) and I'm currently embarking on the Lex Express arc. While I love a lot about this arc it's arguably the weakest of the series so far, and part of that IMO is how it becomes clear how worn down the boys are by the end of it. In hindsight do you think the lads made a mistake continuing on past Summerslam 93? I understand why they continued given the likes of Art Donovan, Bret vs Owen, the rise of Backlund and the Underfaker, but I really think they underestimated the amount of guff to get through to appreciate it. What's your views on the Lex Express, and would it have been a better arc had it stopped earlier?
