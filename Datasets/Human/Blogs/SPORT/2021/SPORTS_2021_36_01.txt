You hear the term "lockdown corner" thrown around in this sub a bit too much, in reference to folks like Stephon Gilmore and Jalen Ramsay. Some of the kids on this sub probably don't remember one of the true, original not lockdown corners - Asher Allen. Playing three years on the Vikings from 2009 - 2011, opposing quarterbacks knew that whenever they targeted Allen, especially in clutch situations, there'd be a decent chance of a completion. Wherever the WR was, there was Allen, typically within 5 yards of him. You could listen to the horror stories from NFC North QBs about throwing towards him, or you could check out his stats - 4 Career INT 11 Passes Defensed 0 Recovered Fumbles 134 Combined Tackles 1 Tackle for a Loss 1 Sack 0 First Team All Pro 0 Second Team All Pro 0 Pro Bowl HOF Snub He slips under a lot of people's radars, but I'm sure if he was around today, he'd be locking up a $21 mil/year bag as the league's premier not lockdown corner.
