Just a reminder that there are only 5 starter spots and 7 reserve spots. Like every year, there's talk about how X player absolutely deserves a spot but I often don't see how there's space. Here's last year's Western All-Stars for reference. --- **Starters:** G: James Harden G: Luka Doncic F: Lebron James F: Kawhi Leonard C: Anthony Davis **Reserves:** G: Chris Paul G: Russell Westbrook G: Damian Lillard [Injured] G: Donovan Mitchell F: Brandon Ingram C: Nikola Jokic C: Rudy Gobert G: Devin Booker [Injury Replacement] --- Looking at that lineup, it's hard to pick almost any of those guys to miss a selection this season. Harden and Westbrook are now in the East, so Curry takes Harden's spot. For now, move injury replacement Devin Booker to Westbrook's spot. As far as starters go, we can also switch Jokic and AD. So, who would miss on it this year? The Jazz probably deserve at least two all-stars, but which two? I think Gobert gets it again due to positional requirements. Conley was getting some buzz so maybe the coaches will get him his first selection as a sign of respect. Donny's been good recently, but earlier the team was winning *in spite* of him being cold, whereas Conley has been perfect in his role. Ingram won't get the forward spot again. If the 11-13 Pels have a representative this season, it'll be Zion. And honestly, AD's spot might be in danger too. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think the two frontcourt spots are between Zion, PG13, and AD (unless you want to select all three and snub Gobert or one of the wildcard guards). Gun to my head, based on this season I take PG first out of those three. And call it bias but I'd still take AD over Zion. An off year for him means he barely makes all-star instead of easily making starter. He's putting up an efficient 22 and 9 with above average defense. Zion being a turnstile until recently pushes me to pick AD. The Suns are good, but not good enough for two all-stars. Booker's heating up but wasn't good in the beginning of the season. He's barely averaging more assists than turnovers. I think Chris Paul will be the Suns' rep. So who's in that last wildcard spot? My candidates include Fox, Demar, SGA, and the aforementioned Zion. I'd lean Demar. Like Conley, he's been perfect in his role as a veteran leader and facilitator. And like Conley, I'm impressed with the low turnovers. So here's my final roster for the West. --- **Starters:** G: Steph Curry G: Luka Doncic [Could switch with Dame] F: Lebron James F: Kawhi Leonard C: Nikola Jokic **Reserves:** G: Damian Lillard G: Mike Conley [Could switch with CP] F: Paul George F: Anthony Davis C: Rudy Gobert WC: Chris Paul WC: Demar Derozan Snubs in a loose order: Fox, Zion, Spida, Booker, SGA, Ingram --- To me, the undisputable locks are Curry, Luka, Bron, Kawhi, Jokic, and Dame. PG13 pretty close to lock status but needs to get healthy. Everyone else could be disputable with certain conditions. The Jazz deserve an all-star (probably two). The Suns deserve an all-star. Normally I wouldn't say any team deserves any selections but those teams have guys playing at an all-star level anyways. **Do you agree with my picks? If not, what would you change?**
