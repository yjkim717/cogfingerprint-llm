**Completion Percentage** * Mac Jones finished with a 77.4% completion percentage (311 completions to 402 attemps), breaking Colt McCoy's record from 2008 of 76.7% * Notably, he increased his completion percentage 0.4% in the championship game from 77.0% to 77.4%, avoiding the fate of Joe Burrow who narrowly missed breaking the record despite holding it entering the championship game vs Clemson * Despite a career completion % of 73.8%, Mac Jones fell over 300 attempts short of the minimum 875 attempts to break Colt Brennan's record of 70.4% * Curiously a number of passing percentage records appear to be held by QBs with the name "Colt" **Passing Efficiency Rating** * Mac Jones finished with a passing efficiency rating of 203.1, breaking Joe Burrow's record from 2019 of 202.0 * Also notably, he very slightly increased his passing efficiency rating from 203.0 entering the game with a rating of 203.3 in the championship game * Mac Jones finishes 2nd all time in career passing efficiency rating (min 325 attempts) behind Tua Tagovailoa. Justin Fields fell from 3rd to 4th all time (behind Kyler Murray) as a result of the championship game. * While Tua finished 2019 with a passer rating of 206.9, he did not meet the minimum number of attempts to be eligible for the all time record due to injury
