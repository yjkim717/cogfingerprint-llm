I was surprised to see how infrequent overtime touchdown passes are. Playing backyard football as a kid, we always pretended it was sudden death overtime and then try to run a route and complete a pass to win the game. But, surprisingly, that pretty much never happens in the NFL. Especially not in the playoffs. None of the twelve quarterbacks with at least 300 regular season touchdown passes (Brady, Brees, P.Manning, Favre, Rivers, Marino, Rodgers, Roethlisberger, E. Manning, Ryan, Tarkenton, and Elway) have thrown a playoff overtime touchdown pass.
