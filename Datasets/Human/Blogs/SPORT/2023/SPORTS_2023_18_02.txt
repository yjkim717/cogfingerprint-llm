I planted some blueberry bushes last spring and didn't know all that goes into the bush in terms of soil needs. About midway through the summer, the leaves began turning purple which I now believe was an ammonium issue. At the time, I didn't know this and instead chalked up the issue to low acidity soil, to which I gave them soil acidifier and coffee grounds. By the end of the summer, most of the leaves had fallen out and I just had hoped that they would come back in the spring. Well, fast forward to now, and the leaves have not come through. I think this is an issue as I planted other blueberry bushes towards the end of summer (didn't have time to kill those thankfully) and they are bearing leaves. My one hope is that when I break the blueberry stems, they still have green on the inside of the stem. Do you have any ideas on what I could do to try to saves these? FYI, I have added ammonium this week after learning about the purple leaf issue.
