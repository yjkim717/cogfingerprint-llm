I was stuck in a plane taxiing around the terminals for about 3 hours on Monday night. I had friends on an AA flight land 30 minutes after us and get to a gate with 20 minutes that night. After getting off the plane baggage took about an hour and a half with our baggage carousel being changed 3/4 time from 9-16( they are not close to each other). I was doing ok, coming from an epic vacation and I had some good content to watch on my device, others were not. I just received a credit code from AS for $300 to apply to another flight. It was very unexpected and a great gesture from them. I didn't reach out about anything figuring they would say it was out of their control.
