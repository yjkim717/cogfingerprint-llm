2021 Bucks: Would’ve lost to the Nets if Kyrie was healthy. Pretty crazy that the Nets still almost won that game 7 with only KD and an injured Harden. 2019 Raptors: Wouldve gotten destroyed by a healthy Warriors team. 2018 Warriors: Might’ve lost if Chris Paul didn’t get injured game 5? Hard to say we’ll never know 2015 Warriors: I think a healthy Cavs team had a good chance to beat them but hard to say.
