I get the Eras Tour was one of THE defining cultural moments of 2023 which is why he chose is as the font for his lists this year, but I thought for sure he would use the Barbie font... but now that I think about it, wouldn't it have been amazing if he used the Oppenheimer font for the worst list and the Barbie font for the best list? Would have been the greatest thing ever, and honestly I'm kinda mad that he didn't do that ðŸ˜…
