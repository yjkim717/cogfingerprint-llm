For context, Embiid had 7 assists to just 1 turnover tonight in the 141-121 routing of the Pacers without James Harden. In the last 5 games without James Harden, Embiid has averaged 7 assists to just 2 turnovers. The reason I do last 5 is because it looks a lot shittier if you include the whole season and that just doesn't fit the agenda. Source:
