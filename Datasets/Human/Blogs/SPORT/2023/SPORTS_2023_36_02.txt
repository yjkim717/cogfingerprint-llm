As the combine approaches, we're going to be talking a lot about body size, but will we be talking enough about name size? Now, there's a difference between the fattest names and the longest names. The longest names have the most letters, but the fattest names have the \*widest\* letters. W's and M's stretch a name out, while i's, l's and j's thin out a name. Sometimes you have a lot of l's, sometimes m's, sometimes a mixture. I set out to determine who has the fattest and skinniest names in the league by using a metric called AWANOL (average width against number of letters). The higher the AWANOL, the fatter the name. You may be wondering, what numbers determine this? Arbitrary ones based on appearance, of course! Almost all letters are the same width, but the ones that stand out are i, l, t, j, r, m, and w. You can make arguments that other letters are slightly bigger or smaller, but I will not listen. Based on their appearances, I've assigned them the following measurements: i and l - .3 units j - .5 units t - .6 units r - .8 units m - 1.5 units w - 1.6 units (in most fonts the W tends to be longer, but this sans serif squishes it a bit) M - 1.6 units W - 1.7 units All other letters - 1 unit Using this metric, and skimming through every roster, I believe I've assembled a top ten list of fattest and skinniest names. Again, more letters does not equal fatter! Someone could be short and fat like Danny Devito, or skinny and long like Victor Wenbanyama. The AWANOL equation is as simple as adding their letter scores up and dividing them by the number of letters present in their name. As an example, Tom Brady - 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 1 + .8 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1.03 AWANOL. Now, 1 is not the average AWANOL, as i's, l's, and t's are more common than m's and w's, so the average is probably around .9 AWANOL. Also, I didn't use a different measurement for capital letters, because everyone's got two, and fuck it. Here are the top 10 skinniest names in the league: Honorable Mention - Malik Willis, Ten QB - .736 for being perhaps the most volatile name I counted 10: Will Dissly, Sea TE - .72 9: Isaiah Spiller, KC RB - .715 8: Miller Forristall, Pit TE -.712 7: Justice Hill, Bal RB - .709 6. Clelin Ferrell, LV DE - .700 5: AJ Cole III LV P - .688 4: Elijah Mitchell, SF RB - .686 3: Dontrell Hilliard, Ten RB - .681 2: Blake Gillikin, NO P - .676 1: Kylin Hill, GB RB - .610 What have we learned here? Well, half the list is RB's, and two are punters. This means something. Here are the top 10 fattest names in the league: 10: Dezmon Patmon, Ind WR - 1.050 tied with Tommy Tremble, Car TE 9: Kamryn Bynum, Min S - 1.070 8: Brandon McManus, Den K - 1.071 7: Mark Andrews, Bal TE - 1.072 6: Andrew Adams, Ten DB - 1.081 5: Samson Ebukam, SF DE - 1.083 4: Jake Kumerow, Buf WR - 1.100 3: Kene Nwangwu Min RB - 1.109 2: Chad Muma, Jax LB - 1.125 1: Tommy Sweeney, Buf TE - 1.133 And there you have it! Much more positional diversity among the fats, which is a positive result. What have we learned? Well, for one, it seems that names of odd AWANOL scores are mostly reserved for the quieter players; only a couple names on these lists are recognizable to casual fans. To be honest, if you asked me which squad would be a better corps to build a team around, I wouldn't really know. Finally, let's place the two winners' names next to each other: Tommy Sweeney Kylin Hill Terrific! Tommy's name is only three letters longer, but doubles Kylin's in written size!
