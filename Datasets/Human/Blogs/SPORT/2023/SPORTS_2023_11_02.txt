I was rewatching the episode where Penny and Sheldon were quizzing each other to improve their respective knowledge and how Leonard was able to answer both questions easily and it got me thinkingâ€¦ ***If we try to rank all seven leads in terms of overall 'knowledge', how would rank them?*** (Since everyone will define 'knowledge' differently, there is probably no right answer but I am trying to reward the different aspects of knowledge more than specializing in one specific area. I am talking about book-smarts and street-smarts and relationship-smarts and career-smarts and family-smarts and cultural-smarts.)
