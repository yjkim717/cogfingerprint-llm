Trading in a 2014 Jeep which has KBB value of $15,000. Want to put $10,000 down and dealership has 2.99% APR promo for a new Hyundai. Dealer was suggesting I lease the vehicle to instantly get the $7500 rebate and then use a credit union to refinance the car and then buy it out right. Are there any gimmicks Iâ€™m missing in doing this?
