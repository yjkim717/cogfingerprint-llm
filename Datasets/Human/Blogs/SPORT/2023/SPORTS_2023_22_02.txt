We're interviewing for a people manager position for a very technical team. We have a candidate that passed the technical screen with flying colors and has answered people management questions in very logical and reasonable ways. The only thing is it's hard to tell if he actually cares about people or just sees them as components of a system. We're going to have lunch with him soon to try to sus out if he seems like an empathetic individual - are there any questions or topics you would broach to try to get the best signal on this?
