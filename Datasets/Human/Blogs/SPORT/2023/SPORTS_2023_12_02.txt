Hi everyone, new Marriott member & first time posting here so apologies if this is a commonly asked question.. But I recently got Bonvoy Brilliant card, and had my first hotel stay using the card + marriott account this past weekend. And the points I'm seeing don't add up to what I thought they would. Using Bonvoy Brilliant card I thought the points are calculated as: (dollars spent) * (6x multiplier for the card + base points multiplier which is anywhere from 2.5-10 + half of base points multiplier for being platinum elite) Here's the points receipt thingy: The stay was $300 dollars, and it looks like base multiplier was ~4.4x, so I'd think it should be 1315 base + 658 elite bonus + 1800 card bonus? What is the +500 "extra"? Is the card bonus missing? I'd like to understand a bit about how points calculation works here as this was my first stay with the Brilliant card so going forward I can understand whether points are missing and when I should reach out to Marriott. EDIT: also, it looks like base points at Townplace Suites is supposed to be 5x multiplier: But calculating backwards from the receipt shows it's only ~4.4x.... I feel like I got less points than I should here?
