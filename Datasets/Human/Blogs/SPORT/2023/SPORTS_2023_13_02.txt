I like playing destroy decks but I always seem to have trouble against discard decks when Hela is played at the end or Ghost Rider brings back a recently discarded powerful card back into the game. No such card exists like this for destroy decks though, except Wolverine but I'd equate him more to the Morbius of destroy decks. Knull is similar but he can only be played at 1 location. Layla Miller and Triage are 2 mutants that have show the ability to bring someone back to life and would be prime cards to have this ability. Or give Ghost Rider this ability and change his text to add destroyed. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
