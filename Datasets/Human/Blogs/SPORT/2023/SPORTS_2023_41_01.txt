## Week 18 * Preseason * Week 2 * Week 3 * Week 4 * Week 5 * Week 6 * Week 7 * Week 8 * Week 9 * Week 10 * Week 11 * Week 12 * Week 13 * Week 14 * Week 15 * Week 16 * Week 17 * Football Version This is a series I've been doing on /r/CollegeBasketball for 4 years, and now /r/CFB for 8. The post attempts to visualize consistency between voters in the AP Poll in a single image. Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is not a measure of how "good" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on. The USC missing votes issue has been resolved, and they were correctly credited with 5 points this week. I assume Southern Miss has been corrected as well, but they did not receive votes. David Thompson missed this week and was not replaced, so only 61 ballots. Jay Tust was the most consistent voter this week. Sheldon Mickles is the most consistent voter this season, followed by Jay Tust, John Werner, Marcus Fuller, and Kevin Brockway. Dylan Sinn was the biggest outlier again this week. Dylan Sinn is the biggest outlier on the season, followed by David Jones, Seth Davis, Dave Borges, and Brian Holland.
