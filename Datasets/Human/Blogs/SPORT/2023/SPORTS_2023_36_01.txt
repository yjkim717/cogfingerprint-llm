As soon as I saw the name of this movie on Marvel's lineup of future films, I knew it was doomed. The last couple years has seen the general public turn on Marvel a bit, after a few flops, unnecessary shows, and a directionless overarching story, people are becoming annoyed by Marvel. And we're calling this movie The Marvels? Sure, it makes sense with the characters, but it sounds like the most self-fellating project yet. It might as well be named New Marvel Movie. I know they probably wanted to avoid more direct sequels, but I believe "Captain Marvel 2" would have done far better, just because it sounds more specific and important to the MCU. I think Captain Marvel was a dumb introduction to the universe in the first place solely because naming a superhero after the company it came from is bizarre. There's a reason Disney isn't working on "The Star Wars Disney Star Wars Movie". P.S. sorry if this is too tangential for the sub but i legitimately think it's costing this film $10 mil plus opening weekend
