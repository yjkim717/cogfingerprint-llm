I just purchased a Zwift Hub to use with my Bianchi C-Sport, which is a 3x8 hybrid bike. I've set up the Hub and attached my bike to the 8-speed cassette. It seems much more difficult to pedal the Hub than it was when using the KICKR snap, and much harder than pedalling the bike in real life. I'm talking a 40-50 watt difference, on average from the Snap (185 -> 140). Furthermore, it has been making some grinding noises when I pedal. It's completely silent when the hub is spinning freely (i.e. I'm not pedaling at all), so I don't think it's related to the Hub at all, but it makes a lot of noise when I pedal. I'm a bike novice, but it seemed to me that I must need to adjust my rear derailleur, so I watched a video to do that. That's when it hit me - just because a cassette is 8 speeds, it doesn't necessarily mean the cogs are the same size. My bike is pretty much silent when I flip it upside down and just pedal through the gears, so maybe the cogs are the issue. Sure enough, the Zwift hub 8-speed cassette is an 11-28T and my C-Sport is 12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32. Those are pretty similar, but they aren't exact. My question: is that a potential reason I'm having such difficulties with the Hub? In general, attaching the bike to the trainer is already a seemingly tight fit, so it wouldn't surprise me if this was the issue. On the other hand, this could just be wishful thinking and the issue is entirely different (or there is no issue and I was just massively overeating my abilities with the wheel-on trainer). Thanks in advance for any help!!!
