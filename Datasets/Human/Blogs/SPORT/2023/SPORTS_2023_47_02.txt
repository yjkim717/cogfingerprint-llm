I am 6'4 and am playing in a rec league. I am a mismatch against like 99% of players in the league but struggle mentally sometimes to lock in and keep getting post position. Some games I will score like 40 points with 10+ boards but then other games I will only score 2 points and completely ghost against similar quality opposition. I also struggle when getting marked by super quick guys because they keep getting position by fronting me. Today was especially frustrating because I got completely clamped by a guy half my size and could never get the ball due to being fronted. The super aggressive guys seem to get in my head and reduce my own tenacity. Any advice on the mental aspect and also about how to deal with people fronting me in the post?
