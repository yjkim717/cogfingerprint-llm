In February I was able to collectively do the ironman distances - 2.4 miles swimming, 112 biking, and 26.2 running. However, nearly all of my running took place on an indoor track. The minutes were melting off, but they didn't translate at all to outside running. I eventually have come to believe that the track I ran on was simply smaller than stated. That said, I was at least sticking to a consistent workout cadence and getting faster. ### Pre-race I hadn't run consistently in about 2 weeks, because I had been lazy and using a cough as an excuse. That said, I did 4 miles in 48 minutes the previous Saturday and a smaller run earlier in the week. My previous outdoor best was a 31:22, when I was in the best shape of my adult life (I've always been fairly overweight as an adult). I thought I was about as fast then as I was now, and set that as my goal. ### Race When the race began, I set out at about a 9:35 pace. On an indoor track, I could pretty easily maintain that, do I wanted to see for that felt. It was tough, but manageable. I felt that it I could hold that for two miles, I might just gut out a 29. After about 1.3 miles, I felt myself start to fade, especially as I started to crest down a very small hill. I didn't think I could attack the hill on the way back (out and back course), and started shifting to a 30:XX goal. Even that felt like it was going to slip away at about 2.2 miles, though. At 2.5 miles I decided that I was going to just empty the tank and see what happened. I took it up to a low 9s pace for half a mile to get to 3 miles at about 30:06, and then just (for me) sold out for the final stretch. I had no idea what my finish time was, based on where I crossed the mat, but it read 31:06 on my watch. Checked later, and hit 30:58! ### Post-race My next goal is to hit sub-30. I think if I ran this race smarter, maybe I'd have taken off 15 seconds, but I'm happy with this overall. I'm still a baby when it comes to wind and cold, but I'm glad I did this and hope to start running outdoors more!
