Got the crate with a Melbourne Fire Brick Co. P85 a few days ago that is sitting in the driveway. I have a few bricks to lay and to pour the 5” counter that the oven will lay on. I’ve been working on this patio area since last fall (had to take a big break when my partially dug out area turned into a milkshake after fall rain with our clay soil) and can’t believe I am this close to putting in the fun stuff. I laid 500 sqft of flagstone as a newbie and almost quit a few times along the way. If y’all have any recommendations for some nice looking peels and other tools please let me know. Which I could get the same company’s accessories but they are still AUS only.
