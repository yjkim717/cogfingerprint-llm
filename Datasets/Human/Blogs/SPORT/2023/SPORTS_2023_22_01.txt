Really want to grow a mango tree but both times I ordered one from Etsy it died within a couple weeks. Can't decide if the sellers stock was bad or if the conditions were just too chilly for it - it was a few weeks ago, but I babied it and brought it indoors at night. Sprayed with neem oil in case there was a fungus. All the leaves still fell off.
