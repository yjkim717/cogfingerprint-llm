**2018 Heat** (Embiid played 3/5 games): James Johnson, Goran Dragic, Kelly Olynyk, Josh Richardson **2019 Nets** (Embiid played 4/5 games): Joe Harris, D'Angelo Russell, Caris Levert, Spencer Dinwiddie **2021 Wizards** (Embiid played 4/5 games): Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Rui Hachimura, Davis Bertans **2022 Raptors**: Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby, Fred VanVleet, Gary Trent Jr **2023 Nets**: Spencer Dinwiddie, Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Royce O'Neale Shamelessly stolen from some dude named connor on Twitter. It's safe to say Embiid is not a playoff performer. If he was in the West for his career, would he have any playoff series wins?
