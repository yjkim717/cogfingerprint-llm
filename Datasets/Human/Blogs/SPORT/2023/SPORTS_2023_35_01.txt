###**Last time, on Photo Friday:** /u/bbauTC grabbed the top spot. > Sleeping Bear Dunes at sunrise on a 16 mile long run. The beauty masks the pain sometimes. /u/fire_foot grabbed the first runner-up spot. > A quiet morning in the city with a cat bonus. /u/madkeepz grabbed the second runner-up spot. > Sunset in Buenos Aires, Bosques de Palermo park ###**Rules of the Road** * Post your running photos of any kind! Beautiful running route? Post it! Race photo look great? Post it! Nobody really reads this! Basically if it is running related you can post it. * Next Friday I will take the top photos and give them special attention.
