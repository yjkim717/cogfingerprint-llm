I have actually been playing for years just hitting the ball. Now I want to be more competitive and learned that I am not lagging to generate compression in my strikes. I’ve watched some YouTube videos however I can’t seem to keep my club head back. I cannot afford lessons and everything I’ve learned has been from videos, trial and error, and game play. For instance I quit using wedges around the green and instead use an 8i or 9i to run up on the pin. I use my driver less on shorter par 4s and punch out when I get out of position in the course. This lag thing is not improving on the range and my slo-mo videos show the club head is not trailing properly. Thanks for reading. Suggestions? [edit- so guess what landed in one of my inboxes today? I can’t paste it but an ad for a Lag Shot Golf series because of course my phone is listening]
