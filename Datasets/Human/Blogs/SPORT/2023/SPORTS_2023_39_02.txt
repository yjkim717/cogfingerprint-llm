I have a road trip coming up to the Redwoods and it involves a lot of Rainer. Last year I hauled a lot of 30 packs from Washington down there and would like to not have to carry the weight the whole way. Wondering if anyone can confirm Rainier in the Eureka / Arcata area. The Rainer website has a locator feature but it seems unlikely that many places have Rainier. Thanks!
