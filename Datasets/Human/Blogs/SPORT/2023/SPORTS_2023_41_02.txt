## Week 17 * Preseason * Week 2 * Week 3 * Week 4 * Week 5 * Week 6 * Week 7 * Week 8 * Week 9 * Week 10 * Week 11 * Week 12 * Week 13 * Week 14 * Week 15 * Week 16 * Football Version This is a series I've been doing on /r/CollegeBasketball for 4 years, and now /r/CFB for 8. The post attempts to visualize consistency between voters in the AP Poll in a single image. Additionally it sorts each AP voter by similarity to the group. Notably, this is not a measure of how "good" a voter is, just how consistent they are with the group. Especially preseason, having a diversity of opinions and ranking styles is advantageous to having a true consensus poll. Polls tend to coalesce towards each other as the season goes on. No missing votes for Southern Miss this week, but Stefan Krajisnik submitted a #24 ballot for USC, and David Jones submitted a #25 ballot for USC, both confirmed through e-mail. Stefan also shared that the AP is aware of the issue and is working to resolve it. John Werner weas the most consistent voter this week. Sheldon Mickles is the most consistent voter this season, followed by Jay Tust, John Werner, Marcus Fuller, and Kevin Brockway. Dylan Sinn was the biggest outlier again this week Dylan Sinn is the biggest outlier on the season, followed by David Jones, Seth Davis, Dave Borges, and Brian Holland.
