They had a pretty talented team I thought they were going to beat the Knicks. Donovan Mitchell and Garland made all-star teams before, Mobley, Jarrett Allen, Levert, Danny Green. The Knicks weren’t that good of a team imo and did worse in the regular season than the Cavaliers, but in the playoffs they beat them handedly 4-1 which shocked me. What was the cause of the Cavaliers’ failure?
