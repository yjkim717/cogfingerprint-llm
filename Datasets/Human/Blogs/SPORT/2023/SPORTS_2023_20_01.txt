I posted this in the event thread but I want to give it more exposure in case a JMR team member sees it- If the event is based on the total of both runs, why do we not see that total added up after each run? It bothers me that we just see the total for each run which doesn’t help, yes I guess you could do the math in your head and we do at least see each team’s current placement, but such vital information for an event should be seen. Imagine if you were watching a baseball game and the scoreboard only showed how many runs in that inning, and you had to wait to find out the actual score. Nobody would do that, and the same applies here. …anyone else agree?
