#Drive Over! Update (12/23, 12:05am ET): The drive is over. With how we structured donations, the full funds will be received by mid-January when we get the final amount from PayPal's Giving Fund system (the trade-off for no transaction fees is they only move the money once a month). At that time OurCFB will make all the donations. In the meantime, anyone needing a formal acknowledgement of the donation, please feel free to follow-up with me if you haven‚Äôt already and I can get you appropriate written acknowledgment required to substantiate a charitable contribution. Expect the final wrap-up post after the donations are made *in the second half of January*, as we‚Äôve done in all previous years. #Thank you to everyone who participated! *** **üß∏üè• OurCFB: TOYS & CHILDRENS HOSPITALS** #[](#i/cfb) 9th ANNUAL \/r/CFB HOLIDAY DRIVE [](#i/cfb) *** **All money raised will be donated.** The total will be split 50% to **Toys For Tots** and 50% to **three children's hospitals** (detailed below). **Welcome to the 2023 Holiday Drive!** Hey everybody! The \/r/CFB Community has conducted A LOT of previous fundraising drives totaling over $130,000.00 since 2013, including purchasing nearly 60 bricks across the country! The first 5 Holiday Drives culminated in a team of redditors joining me (dressed as Raoul Claus) on a giant shopping spree where we buy thousands of dollars in toys and then donate them to the nearest Toys For Tots warehouse: check out the photos from 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. We shifted to purely online donations in 2020 and 2021. Ahead of the 2022 drive, the subreddit formed an IRS-recognized non-profit 501(C)(3), OurCFB. Contributions to OurCFB are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law. We qualify for corporate matching gifts from employers, typically only possible to recognized 501(c)(3) organizations; we have jumped through the hoops to be cleared by several organizations that vet non-profits for such programs (e.g. Benevity), if you need us to add one just reach out to me. If you want to know more about the non-profit, and how things are structured, I‚Äôve written a detailed description here. *** **Team Reward: Children's Hospitals** Rewarding the fanbases that donate the most money, the portion designated for children's hospitals will be split as follows: * 50% to a children's hospital of fanbase with the highest donations (dollar total) * 30% to a children's hospital of fanbase with the 2nd highest donations (dollar total) * 20% to a children's hospital of fanbase with the 3rd highest donations (dollar total) If a fanbase in the top-3 has a children's hospital affiliated with their university, the donation will go there. If they do not, we will discuss *with those specific flaired donors* which children's hospital to donate the money to once the drive is complete. To keep things simple: decision will go by majority vote of donors of that school, with the mods having final approval of any split (or potential tomfoolery). We have made this work in the past for programs such as Notre Dame, Clemson, and South Dakota State. *** #LET'S DO IT! *** Contribute to good causes: * **DRIVE OVER!** ~~Donate via PayPal or Venmo! (recommended minimum $10; points for flair are awarded in $10 increments).~~ * Note: the **PAYPAL GIVING FUND LINK COVERS ALL TRANSACTION FEES** * Do not forget to private message me to let me know so I can connect it to your (1) username and (2) college team you want credited below. * Anonymous donations are okay, I will assume donations are anonymous unless they inform me otherwise. * We have team logos for over 2000 schools worldwide, so it doesn't necessarily have to be a major school (full list) * Please remember that you donated! It should appear as "OurCFB Donation" ...several years ago we had a couple of incidents where people got confused when forgot the drive, saw their CC bill and filed charge-backs. We sorted them all out but it took a few months. * All donors will be credited below! * **DEADLINE**: Midnight (ET) on Friday, December 22. *** #RAOUL CLAUS LOVES YOU... *** #[](#f/tft-sheetl-row03-col16) \/r/CFB IS FOR THE CHILDREN!
