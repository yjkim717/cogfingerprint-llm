Hey there. I ran into a problem earlier today with Elements which I cannot get to the bottom of. For whatever reason when I try to open Elements up I get the popup asking me to choose between Organiser and Video Editor, but when I click on Video Editor a blue bar will appear to symbolise it's loading, then stop partway through. Any suggestions for fixes? I got a popup saying I was running low on memory, so I deleted a few files but since then I haven't been able to get back on.
