Two of the four regionals drew near-full capacity (Fargo was a sellout), Bridgeport drew about half capacity. Only Manchester didn't reach half capacity. * Allentown: 7067 * Fargo: 5061 * Bridgeport: 4462 * Manchester: 3631 Sounds like Manchester should draw better today. Fargo should be a sellout. Would expect Allentown and Bridgeport to do well on Sunday as well.
