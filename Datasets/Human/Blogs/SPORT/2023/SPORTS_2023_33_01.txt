The PAC was the last remaining undefeated conference, all others had 6 or more losses. The current conference records as of this post stand as follows: PAC-12: 19-1 ACC: 19-8 Big 12: 18-8 B1G: 21-7 SEC: 22-6 Note: The ACC and B1G had 2 and 3 of their losses come from conference play, respectively The PAC-12’s 17 game undefeated streak to start the season is the longest since at least 2022. Idk, I haven’t checked previous years. Someone should tho Edit: alright, there were a bunch of mixed messages, so I checked all of the conference records again just now (11:20 EST). They’ve been updated, the PAC-12’s streak hit 19 games seconds before it was broken
