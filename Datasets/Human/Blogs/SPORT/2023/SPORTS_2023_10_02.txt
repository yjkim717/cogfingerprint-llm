Ever since JP signed the huge extension, for two-third of the season he is playing ass basketball. That's not just purely about Steph and Klay taking his shots, but his effort had been outrageously bad. . He doesn't improve his tunnel vision at all and literally refuses to drive to the lane for multiple times and instead settle for a bad bad long 3. You ain't steph come on, those are bad shots that shoot the warriors out of the game for a number of games this season. . Defensively it has been bad, but the thunder game shows he even lacks basic defensive mindset and effort at all. When his offensive production is good this can be ignore, but this year it just hasn't been the same case. I'm sorry but I would really like to have DDV to be part of our future instead of JP even though financially I know it is not viable. JP has to be traded to maximize the window of steph and klay being himself gradually this season.
