Comparing to the bloodbath in the West, I think the situation in the East is quite clear. To me it's always these four teams only: Boston, Miami, Philly and Milwaukee. The Cavs I can see them making some noise but I dont think in a best of 7 series they can beat any of the above four teams. Nets can make the PO but can hardly beat a team in a series with such personnel. Philly because of Doc's coaching weakness gonna be exploited greatly in the playoffs, imo, has the least chance to win the East. The remaining three teams are very close and it really depends on the health of the roster and how they perform. Remember last year's ECF basically Boston and Miami took turns to fall asleep and play poorly from G2 to G5. At this stage while Boston and Milwaukee will be the clear favourite, I would say don't rule out the Heat. No teams, including the ones in the West, wanna see the playoff mode Jimbo and their X-factor will be the aggressiveness of Bam and the shooting of Max Strus. Their defense are suffocating and is best suited for playoff format. Miami is rumored to target Russ if he is to be bought out, so let's see how it goes before today's 3PM trade deadline. Edit: I was not discrediting Boston and Milwaukee at all, merely just saying Miami is my third pick and received lots of downvotes on the comments. Bro wtf this team made ECF last year and battled till G7, and two years ago in the Finals.
