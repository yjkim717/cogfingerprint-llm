The addition of a third scorer in Porzingis is going to be interesting. We will be able to keep 2 of our 3 scorers in the game at all times. The Celtics key role players are all quite efficient (Horford, Williams, and Brogdon.) so I expect the Celtics to have a top 3 offense. I think Brown and Tatum should shoot less to accommodate KP. The role players are very efficient for this team (Horford, Williams, Brogdon) and the Celtics need to utilize that as much as possible. Hopefully with the addition of a third scorer, the stars can play less minutes and therefore be more efficient. The spacing component will also be a big factor. Defenders would shade off Smart because he was a slightly below average shooter and short. KP is a much better shooter and very tall so they will have to play on him much tighter. The combination of increased spacing and more rest for our Stars hopefully will propel our offense into the history books. I hope the Celtics keep KP to 28-30ish minutes a game. All of our centers have injury concerns so the added depth will allow everyone to stay healthy. On a side not, I would like to see Robert Williams get a few more attempts, he’s our most efficient player and I don’t think we run a single action where the lob is the focal point.
