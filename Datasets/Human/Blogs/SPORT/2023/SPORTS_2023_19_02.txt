I started a tradition to do 10-15 cold shower before going to the gym.I start with the legs, and slowly the other parts of the body.Whenever the cold water touches my body, my body instantly stretches up, like something pulling me from above me.I began to understand day by day how to breathe while doing the cold shower, and it taught me belly breathing. I just went outside with a t-shirt, AND I FIGURED THIS! You can warm up by yourself! You can control the heat of your inner body! It is like a "muscle"! It is like I can feel the cold outside, but at the same time I'm warm from the inside and the cold just feels like a normal "wind". This is great! Cold showers really teach you so much about yourself. I just looked in the mirror and here is a cool side effect: I got hunter eyes from this "warming skill/muscle"! THIS IS FANTASTIC! Why do we automatically need a BIG breath as soon as we get into the cold shower? Because the air we get being used and translates into the fuel to warm us eventually! Cold showers are THE exercise for the lungs! They want to be FULLY-opened once the body touches the cold water. You learn how to "resist" less to the cold which lets you breathe a deep more and increase the "capacity" of the lungs
