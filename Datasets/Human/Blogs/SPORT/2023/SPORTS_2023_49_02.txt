I know we’re just starting our journey into the Main Event Mafia, but I’ve already started putting thought into what’s next for OSW. We’re due another Fed arc soon, and I think a retrospective on Rock’s Hollywood heel run could have a lot of mileage. 1- Hollywood Rock is regarded as one of Dwayne’s best incarnations, has the character held up after 20 years. 2- The arc would have a good mix of quality (WM XIX, start of the Smackdown Six) and bollox (Main event Steiner, Nathan Jones, Clint Triple H) 3- It’s a timeframe the lads haven’t covered, as well as an interesting one for the Fed. The remnants of the Attitude Era are still lingering, Ruthless Aggression hasn’t fully taken over and the last few WCW holdovers are arriving. I’d have a potential arc look like this: 1- Summerslam 2002. 2- The Scorpion King 3- Royal Rumble 2003 4- No Way Out 2003 5- Rock Concert Raw 6- WM XIX 7- Backlash 2003 Anyone else interested in this?
