I play Aero in one of my Conquest decks and it occurred to me she is 5-8, so one less power than a normal 5 cost card going by Abomination’s 5-9. Her ability is only to move the last card played to her location. Magneto has a similar ability but pulling 3 and 4 cost cards to his location. He is a 6-12 which is the baseline power for a 6 cost going by Hulk’s power and cost. Polaris and Spider-Man are similar cards that move 1 card and they are 5 power at 3 cost which is 1 power higher than a baseline card like Cyclops who is 3-4. Aero moves 1 card to Magneto’s up to 4 cards moved ability. Yet she is docked a power point for some reason. Aero took a massive hit when she was nerfed from all cards to 1 card and received a power buff from 6 to 8. Still think she should receive a power buff when you compare her to other move enemy cards like Polaris, Spider-Man, and Magneto. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
