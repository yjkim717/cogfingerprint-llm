## /r/CFB Trivia Tuesday! ## This Week's Contest: ### Winter Standings ## Your Trivia Settings ## Rules Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by /u/bakonydraco, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/Davidellias, and /u/iamnotacola. Each week there will be five questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. You get a one point speed bonus for finishing in under 2:30. There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance. ## Last Week ### Individual #### Last Week Eight users got perfectos last week: ||||| -|-|-|-|- /u/JustinMSU21|/u/MvpJokic|/u/pixarfan9510|/u/6ftSchnitzel /u/Astone1996|/u/Fit_Assumption9295|/u/matlockga|/u/thincolnlincoln Nine other users aced the questions, but not in time for the bonus point. ### Premier Tier |Rank|Team|Last Week |-|-|-|-|-| | 1 | Ohio State | 1 | 2 | Michigan | 2 | 3 | LSU | 3 | 4 | Notre Dame | 5 | 5 | Alabama | 8 | 6 | Oklahoma State | 9 UMass sits in 26th place as the top non-P5 team.
