I'm not majorly far in the game, but Spoiler warning for anyone who hasn't done the Forest Array main / first mission. Does anyone know if you get your XP back from boss fights if you don't go over the yellow beam but defeat the boss. I left the xp yellow beam as a back up incase I rinsed my stims against Dagan Gera but then managed to defeat him before I needed to go over it. After the defeat, it wasn't there anymore - but there was a force essence that restored my health after the cut scene with Rayvis.
