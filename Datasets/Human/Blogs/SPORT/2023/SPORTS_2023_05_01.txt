The NBA is at an interesting Crossroads. There are 2 teams of older stars that are vying for a title out west. (Lakers and Warriors) Team teams of a mix of old and young stars(Suns and Bucks) and a two young teams(Denver and Boston). Every team has made a finals run recently and most of the stars have a ring. The team that wins the title this year, especially if they come out west will have to run through the gauntlet.
