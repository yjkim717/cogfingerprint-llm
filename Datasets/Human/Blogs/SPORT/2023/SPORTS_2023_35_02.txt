###**Last week, on Photo Friday:** /u/Percinho grabbed the top spot. > You'd not think that these misty winter morning photos from my run this were were technically within the borders of London. In fact, the treeline you see at the bottom of a small hill is the administrative border! /u/13ECCA grabbed the first runner-up spot. > Say what you will about early morning winter running, but when the sun starts to creep up over the horizon behind the trees... *Chef's kiss* > > /u/astuder grabbed the second runner-up spot. > Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States Â· February 5, 2023 > > Quick getaway to New Orleans last weekend. Woke up before sunrise on Sunday, and managed to get a few miles in before heading back home. > > ###**Rules of the Road** * Post your running photos of any kind! Beautiful running route? Post it! Race photo look great? Post it! Eastern time = early post for Pacific time! Nobody really reads this! Basically if it is running related you can post it. * Next Friday I will take the top photos and give them special attention.
