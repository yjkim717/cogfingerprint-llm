I don’t listen to music very often while I’m running but decided to do that over the weekend. Got to my run, put in my earbuds and connected them to my 265 only to get a message that my downloaded music had expired and I needed to connect to Wi-Fi to redownload it. I drove to my run so connecting to Wi-Fi wasn’t an option. Would’ve been really nice if I had gotten a reminder or two before the downloads expired.
