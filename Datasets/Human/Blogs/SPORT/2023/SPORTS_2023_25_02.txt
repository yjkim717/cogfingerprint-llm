DIYer here. Never done much in the way of insulation that required any thought, just the basics. But, we bought a new house this year and it has a 500 square foot attic with a peaked roof. Got a quote for 8500 from the local guys to spray closed cell. Temps here get to-30 in the winter and there will be a 3/4 bath up there, so I need high r-value. I’ve always (eventually) been successful at projects that are new to me, but I’m wondering how feasible it might be for me to take this on.
