## /r/CFB Trivia Tuesday! ## This Week's Contest: ## Summer Standings/Questions ## Your Trivia Settings ## Rules Trivia Tuesday is a weekly feature run by /u/bakonydraco, /u/DampFrijoles, /u/Davidellias, /u/iamnotacola, and /u/KiltedCajun. Each week there will be five questions ranging from questions most everyone can get to questions that might stump just about everyone. Your goal is to quickly answer them to the best of your ability. You get a one point speed bonus for finishing in under 2:30. There are definitely still ways you could cheat the system, but please do not. This is meant to be a fun weekly feature, and we encourage you to take it at face value and answer the questions without assistance. ## Last Week ### Individual #### Last Week Six individuals aced this week: |||| -|-|-|-|- /u/HoldThiisW|/u/BucksGuy|/u/6ftSchnitzel /u/e8odie|/u/Sportsboss|/u/IceColdDrPepper_Here 9 additional users got all of the questions correct, but did not meet the time bonus. ### Premier Tier |Rank|Team|Last Week |-|-|-|-|-| | 1 | Georgia | 6 | 2 | Michigan | 1 | 3 | Ohio State | 2 | 4 | LSU | 13 | 5 | Georgia Tech | 8 | 6 | Michigan State | 4 Oklahoma slipped out of the top six this week, going from 3rd to 9th.
