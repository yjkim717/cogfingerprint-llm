What we do know is that they are encouraging Hybrid employees to come in 50% of the time, and Virtual employees to come in 3 days a month. What we don't know - is everything else. Well, except we know that we can still wear jeans to work and don't have to wear socks, which might not be the hard hitting information we want to hear, but at least we now know it. They didn't take questions on it today, and they used vague language, which was probably by design. Each Line of Business is likely going to be spending time answering questions as to how it will look for them. Some (many IFS roles) were permanently remote before COVID. Some roles don't make sense to come in. I think it's fair for everyone to be allowed to vent their frustrations about today's news, but as with most announcements at PwC, the details come later. They won't be using these metrics for this coming CRT so you have until July 1st to take action. Just some thoughts to help calm some of the storm (myself included) from the news that no one wanted to hear
