So i purchased 3 trousers in a bundle deal approx Â£8 per pair. However when the parcel arrived they had only sent me 2 pairs. I contacted them and told them but they told me they sent 3 and basically called me a liar. So i opened a return request and have returned them for a refund. They were delivered and i was supposed to have been refunded by yesterday but i didnt so can only assume seller indicated a problem and is sticking to their story. Just wondered how vinted were likely to rule on this one? As i guess it is just my word against theirs.
