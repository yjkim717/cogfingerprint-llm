Just occurred to me that when I finally find time to see Knock at the Cabin, I will have seen four of M. Night Shyamalan's films in theaters in a row (Split, Glass, Old, Knock at the Cabin). I've also seen the last four Denis Villeneuve movies in theaters (Sicario, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Dune). Safe to say I'll be trying to keep those streaks going as long as I can. How about you guys?
