I get to play the game a couple of hours a week, and when I’m not playing, I’m watching walk through videos and build guides. I can’t find anyone who’s done a fun warrior build. My character is all over the place, because I tried a guide by getting incantations for my twin blade, but I’ve found that I like the bloodhound way better. My warrior currently has stats all over the place, including str 24, dex 18, faith 12 (for incantations) and vigor at 27. I also did the dragon rune farm and completely forgot to pop the pickled foot. Not sure where I should even go now, after I’ve beat Godrick.
