I play in a men's league and have been struggling to getquality seals in the post and on box outs. I'm 6'4 and one of the tallest guys in the league and I actually do pretty good against taller guys. Where I end up struggle is against slightly shorter but stockier and quick guys. They always get super low and are able to get in front or around the back on entry passes to swat the ball away from me. Some guys will also do this thing where they will stand 4-5 feet behind me when I try to post up and then sprint and knock out the ball when I get my entry pass. Similar thing happens on box outs. I end up losing the boards due to positioning against these guys. Some other guys in my league have said that sometimes i get too passive with setting my position and fighting for the space, so that might be the underlying cause. How can I be better about this? Is it a technique thing? A mentality thing? I'm honestly not sure.
