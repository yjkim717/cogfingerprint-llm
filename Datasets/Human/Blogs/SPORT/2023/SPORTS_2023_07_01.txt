i know the start of the season is just as sweaty as the tail-end, but i really wanted to try out some of the weapon changes. i’m balancing a ~2.5KD against a 10% win ratio and my ELO has dropped to 950, as a lifetime 2.5KD player who never typically ended a season below at least diamond. If you’re an anyway decent player and you don’t have a pressing need to try out some changes, then I’d maybe let crucible cool down a bit. Matchmaking is out to get you hahaha.
