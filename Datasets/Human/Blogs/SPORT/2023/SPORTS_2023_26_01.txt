Giving up 37, a mid-late FRP next year and a SRP next year for just one protected FRP in six years feels like too much, especially after seeing some decent guys still around at 37 last night. I know we have too many picks and Denver's current core will be old by 2029, but couldn't we have also gotten maybe their '26 or '29 SRP out of this trade? Or cash?
