I am currently looking to build or buy a shed for outdoor lawn storage. I want to build something like this ( but need opinions on whether this is too difficult of a task for someone with little experience in working with wood and construction. In the past, I built a wood desk and shelf that required cutting and piecing together, but have no experience in framing, doors, or windows at all. I would love to learn how to build things like this, but not sure if I should start with something smaller/easier. Any thoughts are much appreciated.
