Been on holiday for two weeks, came back yesterday a little jet lagged and rusty so I figured I wouldn’t be on my A-game, but I’ve played 8 and lost 8 so far, four of them to people on their flawless game. Usually an extremely solid (2.3 lifetime) player Clanmate mentioned MM changes but didn’t go into a huge amount of detail - what did I miss?
