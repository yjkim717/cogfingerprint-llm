I recently thought about the potential mass adoption of AR glasses (maybe even contact lenses) in the future and the impact this will have on architecture. This article is from 2017 and explains pretty well what I mean: Basically, with everyone wearing AR devices over their eyes, all visual details in architecture (walls, ceilings, light, even windows to a certain degree) can be recreated digitally without actually having to build them. So basically, a bland, windowless concrete box could become anything from a minimalist, international style house to a highly complex deconstructivist building. I still think that people and governments will have the urge to build representative buildings in the future. The prestige of having the longest, tallest or largest building can't be recreated by AR. The same thing will probably apply to handcrafted/high quality ornamentation (stucco, masonry, woodwork, etc.), because the craftsmanship gives these elements a quality beyond their aesthetics. Expensive materials are another thing that can't be recreated by augmented reality. At the other hand, AR enables new ways to show off your wealth. NFT interiors could become a big trend in the future. What's your opinion on this subject? How do you think AR will change architecture? Note: My English kinda sucks. I'm sorry.
