Led by 4 undefeated Power 5 teams, a first since at least 2014, the teams playing for their conference crown this weekend are the best of any group in the CFP era. The average Power 5 team playing this weekend has a record of 11.0 - 1.0, good for a win percentage of 0.917. This narrowly edges out 2015 (10.8 - 1.0, 0.915) and 2019 (10.9 - 1.1, 0.908) for the best record of P5 championship participants in any year Accounting for all 10 FBS championship games, the average record of 10.4 - 1.6 (0.863) trails only the 2020 Covid year in win percentage (7.0 - 1.0, 0.880). See the table below for the stats for each year &#x200B; |Year|Average P5 Record (%)|Average FBS Record (%)| |:-|:-|:-| |2023|11.0 - 1.0 *(0.917)*|10.4 - 1.6 *(0.863)*| |2022|10.1 - 1.9 *(0.842)*|9.5 - 2.5 *(0.791)*| |2021|10.4 - 1.6 *(0.867)*|10.1 - 1.9 *(0.842)*| |2020\*|7.0 - 1.0 *(0.875)*|7.0 - 1.0 *(0.880)*| |2019|10.9 - 1.1 *(0.908)*|10.3 - 1.8 *(0.851)*| |2018|9.9 - 2.1 *(0.825)*|9.6 - 2.4 *(0.800)*| |2017|10.5 - 1.4 *(0.882)*|10.0 - 2.0 *(0.836)*| |2016|10.3 - 1.3 *(0.887)*|9.7 - 2.2 *(0.818)*| |2015|10.8 - 1.0 *(0.915)*|10.0 - 2.0 *(0.833)*| |2014|10.6 - 1.1 *(0.906)*|9.6 - 2.0 *(0.804)*| |*Average*|*10.1 - 1.4 (0.882)*|*9.6 - 2.0 (0.828)*| |*Average (w/o 2020)*|*10.5 - 1.4 (0.883)*|*9.9 - 2.1 (0.826)*| *Notes:* 1. *Not all records add up to 12 games due to rounding and some unbalanced schedules (e.g. 2017 Miami who entered at 10-1)* 2. *The Big 12 Championship Game did not exist before 2016, nor did the Sun Belt Championship. The AAC similarly did not add their championship game until 2015* &#x200B; Other Fun Facts: * 2023 is only the second season where the entire top 5 is competing for a conference title, with 7 of the top 8 playing. This is matched only by 2019, which had the entire top 8 teams represented * 2023 is also the first non-covid year with more than 3 undefeated Power 5 teams remaining and the first year with more than 4 total undefeated teams * The 10 combined losses between Power 5 participants also matches 2020 and 2015 as the fewest of the CFP era (including the top 2 Big 12 teams from 2015 would raise that year to 12 combined losses) * 2018 saw the worst record for both the P5 and FBS as a whole. Only 4 Power 5 teams had fewer than 3 losses (compared to 9 in 2023) for a total of 21 losses, worst of the decade. The Group of 5 did not fare much better, with 27 losses tied for second worst of the era with 2016, and behind only the 31 losses of 2022
