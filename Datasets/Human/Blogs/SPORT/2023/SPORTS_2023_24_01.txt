So I was thinking that maybe a listing of the top selling items for each store would be a hoot. Kinda like a top five beers for each store, top five meat products, top five chips, top five etc… It’d probably be a bear to setup but tell so much about the communities the stores reside in. Like “does Austin sell more iPAs than South San Antonio?”
