I'm looking to upgrade my Yamaha YAS-207 soundbar and have more or less narrowed my choice down to either Bose 600 plus Base Module 500 or Sonos Beam Gen 2 plus mini sub. Set up will be LG 55" NANO916NA, xbox series x and virgin media box. Living room is open planned, TV is in corner. Ceiling height is about 8ft and sofa is about 8ft away from TV too. Room is about 13ft by 12ft. I'm tempted by the Bose 600 as it seems to be more or less on par with the Beam Gen2 but with the benefit of actual up firing speakers. I was also tempted by the Sonos Arc but I don't think I can really justify spending that much (as again, I'd get a sub with it). Just wondering what thoughts are on either the 600 or Gen 2? TIA EDIT: Thanks for everyone's views/advice. In the end I went with the Sonos Arc (as it was Â£200 off) and Sub Mini. So far, so good.
