I think that for me, what I’m mostly scared of is losing control over my bodily functions. Like, if I felt n*, and knew I would only v* once, I think I would be okay. I would still hate it and be afraid, but I believe I could let it happen. But I’m absolutely terrified that if it happens once it’ll just happen over and over again and never stop. I think this is because of some medical trauma I’ve experienced but idk. Does anyone feel the same? Like, that you could manage if you v* once, but you’re absolutely terrified of it happening repeatedly?
