If so, how did you do it? I have basic comprehension and speaking skills from listening to parents speak in their native tongue (mostly to each other, not to me) and some Chinese school (which I dropped out of). From here I don't know if I should study the language from the books or if simply absorbing a lot of Chinese media and talking to my family in Mandarin is enough. If I would take classes I could, but I don't have enough time or money to do that. I'm curious how others have achieved this.
