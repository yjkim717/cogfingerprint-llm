Voting will always go the way of Chicago and always has been. All of Springfield And the rest of Illinois could vote opposit of Chicago and it would still go the way of Chicago. Unfortunately we live in a state where our vote doesn't actually count. But for those of you who still want to vote to make you feel better you should. I just know I see a lot of new posts on Springfield about our town and wanted to inform you.
