I am a software engineer. Boston => Seattle I kept a house in Boston and attempted to rent it. It went extremely poorly, costing me tons of money. I spent a decent amount renovating it too. It’s gone up significantly in value, around 75k. I have an interested buyer so we probably wouldn’t need agents. When I think about it I want to move back. Boston kind of just feels like where I want to live. However, whenever I look at job postings it’s very slim. There’s maybe 2-3 companies I’m interested in. It’s the reason I moved to Seattle. Seattle has a shit ton of jobs and so does Bay Area... but I don’t want to live in either place. So I’m not sure where I even can live or want to live I have this ambiguous fear that if I don’t have a house, housing values will continue to increase at crazy rates. My house went up basically 25k per year. Seems like it’s gonna be hard to find another place I’ve asked my current company about remote work. They seem very... not fully committed. Basically they would say “we don’t know when we’re gonna tell people to come back to the office so stand by”. I’m living in an expensive apartment downtown so I can be close to work. It seems like a waste now It’s difficult for me to quit the job because I have a lot of RSUs vesting. I could make as much as 50k in cycle and the job does pay very well What would be the best approach now?
