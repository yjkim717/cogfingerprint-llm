Hi I’m a trophy/achievement hunter and there have been many games where I had to give up on getting all of the trophy’s because of a few online trophy’s. Sometimes the servers are shut down and they are impossible or it’s hard to find anyone because the game is so old or unpopular and they are just really annoying. I think they should be put in a separate category like DLC trophy’s that way you can still achieve the platinum. Who else thinks this ?
