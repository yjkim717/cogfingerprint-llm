My best friend is a 66 year old lady who pretty much exclusively plays WoW and she LOVES zombie shows and such. She wasnâ€™t able to do dying light because the learning was just too difficult for her and fast in the moment. If any of you have any ideas I would love some suggestions her and I can online coop. Thanks all
