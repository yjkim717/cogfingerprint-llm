So I have a friend from church who has recently gotten into Arbonne. She posts every day about how amazing it is and takes pictures with multiple products she is using. Many of these products can be $60-$100 cad or more. While not out of the realm of normal, it is a lot more than needs to be spent on skincare. The concerning part is she is a student trying to pay for school. She had a family member she trustsb100% recruit her into their downline. I am more upset at that woman I have never met than my friend. 99% or people lose money with MLMs. My friend is not ready to hear this though and I have no idea how to calmly and politely help her without pushing her away. Really sucks to watch someone I care for fall into this.
