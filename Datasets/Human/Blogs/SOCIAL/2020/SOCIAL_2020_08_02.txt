So, I thought this would be a nice guide for new cat owners like myself just in case. This all happened last night, it started around 7pm. Symptoms: (this is what my cat experience) He first started vomiting, then he started experience some nasty diarrhea. After awhile he stopped but became lethargic. He refused water and food. What I did: When he became lethargic, I brought him inside, lyed down a shaggy blanket (just in case of emergency) and gave him a bowl of water, he still refused it. So I did some research, and found if you flavour the water, their more likely so drink it, so I mixed in wet food into the water, and thank the gods it worked. I did this about three times, always making sure he had water. Finally he was feeling well enough to sleep, I watched him sleep for an hour before heading to bed myself. He still dry heaves, but only once every hour or so.(this is the morning after) I hope this can help.
