On Wednesday I was speaking with a rep from Living Wealth asking her some questions about my policy. We started talking about Nelson Nash whom she had met multiple times and I mentioned that James Neathery had mentioned on his podcast that Nelson had 13 policies when he passed away. She said Ray has 121 policies!!! She said he makes millions of dollars off loans and when he dies, after the loans are paid off by the death benefit (which is huge because of additional PU) his wife will get millions and she will get additional millions of dollars for years from people paying off their loans! That's just mind blowing. Talk about keeping your money in motion!
