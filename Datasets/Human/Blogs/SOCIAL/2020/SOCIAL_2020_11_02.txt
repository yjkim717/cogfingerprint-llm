Got in a car accident in December. After fighting with insurance for the past couple of months, they've bone ahead and totaled my car. I'm expecting a payment of approximately 3-4k. Very tempted to get an ebike and commute the 14-18 miles this way instead of getting a replacement car. Any thoughts? Suggestions of bikes to look at? What are some of the options in the 1-2k range? &#x200B; Thanks!
