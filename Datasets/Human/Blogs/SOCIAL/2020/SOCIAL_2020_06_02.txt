No matter what I do or where I go, I always somehow manage to ruin everything I touch. It's no coincidence that the department I was a part of in college got dropped right as I graduated, or that sales suddenly took a nosedive the first week I was hired on... I'm like a disease that kills everything I come in contact with, a person whose touch is corrosive and acidic.
