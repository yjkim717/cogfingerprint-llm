Trigger warning: suicide So, my grandpa has finally told me himself he plans on assisted death today, TWO DAYS before he, "kicks the bucket", so I've have been upset. I did know before hand, and accepted it, had my cry, but, after he told me, I just started bawling for an hour, and I think I might be feeling resentment, I have issues understanding emotions, and am missing some as well. So, what do I do, I have until Friday, hopefully.
