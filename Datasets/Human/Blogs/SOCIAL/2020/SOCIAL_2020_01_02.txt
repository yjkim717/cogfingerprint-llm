**I am only going to say this once. If you are in anything other than the 1st game of a tournament there is NO SECOND CHANCE! THERE IS NOTHING IF YOU FORFEIT! And even in game 1 it’s a lame thing to do as you usually get auto-second chance!** **So this evening we were in the quarters playing the top goal scorers and unsurprisingly we go 3-0 down ~2 mins in. The only thing to do, if you’re not a chicken bellied win simp who cant take losing, is to suck it up and play until final whistle. Just like you would in ANY OTHER GAME!** **Seriously is your ego that fragile you can’t take losing and any chance of actually EVER winning the game because you’ve decided for the team you already lost. A forfeit is a loss and makes no difference to mmr. Just play the game to final whistle and BE PROFESSIONAL JUST LIKE THE SQUISHY YOU CLAIM TO WANT TO BE!** **FOR GETTING TO THE QUARTERS I GOT 100 CREDITS! 100!**
