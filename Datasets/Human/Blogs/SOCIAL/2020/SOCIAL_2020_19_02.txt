First let me be clear, i have not watched any of Sushants movie and will never watch any, im not interested in bollywood. Im not a fan, nor a hater. The way a dead mans suicide is portrayed by media, received by public and politicized by ruling party is beyond any ethical/ moral values. People are just not able to accept the fact that he was depressed and needed help, and he ended his life. Horrific thing is the new ways people are coming up that it was not a suicide. This terrified me. A video that claims to be a woman from saudi does a 'virtual postmortem' giving absolute stupid justifications how his tongue is not out,etc, etc. So many other videos of similar kind without any source of origin by people with no medical background are surfacing and demeaning his death to next level. Someone sent me videos of legit doctors (cant confirm but they were in hosp wearing doc uniform) jumping on opportunity to make a name for themselves by giving another virtual autopsy. 24/7 that mans face is running in media with conspiracy theories now far greater than moon landing hoax. That concerns me, is common sense of common man destroyed beyond repair ? Have people completely lost critical thinking skills ? Majority of my friends are into this deaths conspiracy theory, one of them even sent me this today "dude, sab post mortem fake hai, autopsy fake h, sab details chupaye gaye hai, high profile case h cause party aditya thackeray ne b attend kia tha, usko bachaneka sajish chalra hai MH govt ka, isiliye bahar se kisiko investigate karne nahi dere hai" Translation: "dude postmorte is fake, autopsy is fake, every detail is hidden. its a high profile case cause aditya thackeray also attended the party , its all a plan to save him by MH govt. Thats the reason no one from outside is allowed to investigatr" It is horrifying how easily people are falling into conspiracy theory of utter garbage level. Even flat earth would look more appealing that this. A legend, rightly so.. once said "**Hindustan Me jab tak Cinema hai log chut\*ye bante rahenge"** "Until the time there is cinema in india, people will be fooled"
