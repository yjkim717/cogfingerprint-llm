I really liked the hardmode missions during the Wichita campaign it added an extra challenge which was very nice imo, something to strive for, also was nice that you could get to top tier a week early, does anyone know why these were taken out this campaign. Would be nice to have this campaing especially with these weekly havocs being time gated. Should WG bring back weekly hardmode missions? View Poll
