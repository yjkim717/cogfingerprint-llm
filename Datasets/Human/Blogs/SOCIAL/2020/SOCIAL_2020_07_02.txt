Lately I've been feeling pretty crappy (I'm overweight) and have been wanting to get into simple at home workouts. I was able to write a 30 minute cycle that I can get through without straining myself too hard. I've also been slowly adding better foods into my home and actually making a proper meal instead of instant, processed boxed foods. It's been about a week now and while I still have my cheat moments with eating, I still make sure to workout at least once a day, and if I don't go for a bike ride then I try to do it twice. Just wanted to rant about how good I've been feeling since starting my at home routine! Hopefully my feeling good can give someone like me that extra push to start their working out at home to feel better too. If anyone has any simple at-home workouts that don't require anything I'd love to hear!
