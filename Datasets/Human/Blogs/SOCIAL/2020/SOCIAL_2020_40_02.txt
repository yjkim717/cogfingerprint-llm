Hey guys. I (25f) struggle with depressive episodes and an eating disorder. I'v been fighting these for the past 12 years. I met my partner (25m) in the beginning of the year and we got close really fast. He knew about my anxieties and I've talked about my struggles but he hasn't seen them first hand until the past 2 weeks. I've been depressed and engaging in eating disorder behaviors. I opened up to him about it all just a few days ago and it's been really hard. He takes on other peoples feelings of pain and discomfort so my issues, causing him major concern have been stressing him out which is hard for me because I want to turn to him but he cant seem to handle it. I feel so worried him seeing my issues first hand is pushing him away...which is causing more issues and sadness and anxiety in me. Side note i am reaching out for help other than him. We are moving in together this weekend...we were both really excited but I'm so worried now if he is feeling unsure about us and our relationship. I want to bring up these concerns and I have a little but I'm more nervous to because I fear he will react defensively and get even more annoyed and stressed by me. I'm really not sure what to do. Is giving him space this week best? Idk. Any advice would be really helpful..thanks everyone <3
