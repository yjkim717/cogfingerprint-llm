You know what just fuck everything. If I’ve learned anything this year it’s that I’m just a worthless expendable sack of flesh and that’s all I’ll ever be. If everyone has a purpose in life, then I’m just here to feed the blood sucking parasites in this world that make it their purpose to feed off other people. It fucking sucks and if there is a higher being out there that gave me this purpose, fuck you!!!
