I don't know what to do at this point, I'm so upset I can't even sleep right now. Currently my grandfather is on his way out, and for a while I was having dinners with him every couple weeks. I know he was deteriorating, and he's scared and doesn't want me to see him like he is right now, but damnit I want to be there. I'm sick of my family shutting me out, or acting like I'm trash. They don't say it to my face but it's implied in their talk and glances towards me when their talking about dumb thing. Like zip codes and how embarrassing it would be for them to live at that zip code. Right now my grandfather has gone radio silent on me, and it's eating me up not knowing what his condition is. I've texted him numerous times on Facebook but he's not looking or even replying to my messages. I feel I did or said something and I apologized for something I said that was inappropriate that I said in passing. Yet I don't know what else, if anything that I've done. I don't want to be shut out again, I got pushed out when my grandmother died and now I'm being pushed out by my grandfather and it sucks. I know he isn't well, yet I just want something, anything at this point so I know if he's alive or dead. I can't stand this silence as it's just making me feel awful and scared that he's already gone. I'm at a loss of what to do, should I send him another message, should I hope that he reaches out to me again, or should I just leave it be? Edit: I just feel like a shitty person, like as if I did something and it's made him shut me out. Maybe I am the problem and I should just let it be, I just want to be there is all.
