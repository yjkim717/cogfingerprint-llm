I remember one clip from it and a few tidbits of information. The film was in black-and-white and I think it was from either the fifties or sixties. It may have also been a pastiche on World War II. The clip I remember was a long shot of a child (I think) walking through some ruined area with some people moving about and others interacting with various derelict objects. I think that the film is decently well-remembered, as I remember seeing the clip a few times throughout the years. It sounds like something that would've been an Andrei Tarkovsky movie, but I don't think it was.
