I've heard people say that bottom growth/changes in general is one of the first things to happen once you start testosterone, but how quickly did you guys notice changes? I've been on T for less than a week but when I tried to masturbate last night things felt, different? Just wanted to know if this was common/normal and how fast y'all began to experience bottom growth
