“Transparent Soap” Hell is a lot different than how you might have thought There are no racks or whips, no cat o’ nine tails, nothing but A room painted whiter than the snow beneath the sun And there aren’t any people, you are the only one It’s very brightly lit, there are glaring office lights Lining up and down the ceiling in columns and in stripes There’s a shower in the corner but the strangest thing of all There are mirrors placed on every single surface and wall Floaties in my eyes They’re how I know I’m alive Just wait ‘til you forget every person that you know And you lick every mirror so that no reflection shows And the soap is transparent and apparently, it’s green But that is just a rumor, color’s not something I’ve seen Shower and wonder why you never feel fresh And try to look at something other than your own flesh But the soap is transparent and the scars show right through You can’t escape the fact you’re stuck in Hell with you There’s no hellfire and there aren’t hellhounds So there’s no way to warm up, and the coldness surrounds So you find that your mind and your skin becomes dull And the demons are all laughing deep inside your fractured skull Monochrome eyes Does this mean that I’ve died Just wait ‘til you forget every person that you know And you lick every mirror so that no reflection shows And the soap is transparent and apparently, it’s green But that is just a rumor, color’s not something I’ve seen Shower and wonder why you never feel fresh And try to look at something other than your own flesh But the soap is transparent and the scars show right through You can’t escape the fact you’re stuck in Hell with you Just wait ‘til you need to feel anything at all So you grow out your nails and you scratch and you claw But you can’t see any marks or feel a shot of pain There’s just a chilling, killing numbness spreading to your brain Shower and wonder why you never feel fresh And try to look at something other than your own flesh But the soap is transparent and the scars show right through You can’t escape the fact you’re stuck in Hell with you
