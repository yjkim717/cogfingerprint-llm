My bf always watches me eat. The other day he asked if I could save him some (certain foods) before finishing them. It made me so uncomfortable and now I'm literally uncomfortable eating around him. We live together so it just ends up making me restrict then I binge when he isnt around. It sucks and makes me feel annoyed at him
