Currently living in a rural farming village in northern vietnam and would like to make the villagers some fresh bread as most of them have never had it before. I have access to flour, but no yeast. I have been trying to catch some wild yeast for five days now with little luck so I was wondering if anyone had some advice. Here is what I have been doing. 1.5 cups of flour mixed with 1 cup of water, stirred together in a small bowl, covered in plastic wrap. Every day remove half of the mixture and replace with approx the same amount of flour and water. After day three I found some cheese cloth and stopped using the plastic wrap. I've repeated the remove half and replace step every day for five days now, it smells very sour, but there aren't many bubbles (there are some though) and I cannot smell yeast or alcohol. It does not appear to be rising at all. I have read that using a little pineapple juice can acidify it and that can help but I haven't tried it yet. Any advice is appreciated, thanks.
