I've been feeling so empty And blood can’t fill the cavity I’m red and raw and sawing deep To set it free, but nothing goes It felt so good, it hurts so bad I thought that blood would seal my gaps But blood’s too thin, and I’m so glad That no one sees the water flow Connect all the dots with red Connect all the dots I bled You don't understand my head And honestly, I’m near insane I'm having breakdowns left and right My leg is hurting, smarting, I Cannot begin to know to fight Coward's move to draw the blade But I’m a coward, pick them up I can’t put them away because I didn't want to hurt today, but I am feeling just so broken This is all I think about It haunts and hurts and won't get out I hate myself, I hate my doubts I hate my cuts, bleeding, open I don't know how to ask for help You say you're proud but anger smells The scent is thick, I hate myself I hate this stupid world I made Why'd I think that I was clever The wounds are dry and tough as leather They hurt, they're cold, can't make this better I'm done with my mind's stupid games I'm drowning in a pair of scissors Can’t recognize myself in the mirror How did I become this sinner I hate myself, I hate my brain I grit my teeth and grab the tool I pinch the skin and metal's cool It feels so good, I'm such a fool It's hot like fire, warm like coals I'm nothing but a walking shell My corpse still walks, but my soul fell It’s falling fast, a route to Hell To repay all the guilt I stole Blood is just a temptress, flirt She coaxes you and makes you hurt I really should buy longer skirts I hurt myself, I hate myself This rut is deep, I've gone too far I've tempted Fate with future scars And yet I continue to mar Drag me up, too deep I've delved My room is cold, the sky is black Why do I feel I can't turn back I feel like breaking down, I'll crack Into a thousand tiny pieces But if I shatter into shards At least I will not hurt at all I'm hoping that I still can call I hope this stinging ceases Please don’t leave me all alone My heart is hardening to stone The monster’s weakness is unknown And it’s arrived to hunt its prey This monster blocks and blots the sun It grabs me in between its thumb And index, what’s next, I’ve become The monster, we are both the same The gates of Hell are open wide They beckon me to come inside The fire burns but warms me, I Learned to love the smell of sadness How can you despise someone Who’s always there when you're alone Sorrow's here to make me cold But fire brings me madness I'm empty and worthless The fire of Hell claims me It stains me I stained me The glow and red and everything mushes into a smudge of gray Oh, how I'd love to feel just gray Not blue Or black Or red Just gray
