Alright, so I was about to settle down on my couch and watch this documentary and right from the start for the first 25 seconds they use this sad, mellow strings. But of course instead of allowing myself to settle down, my brain kicks in and now I can't get it out of my head. There is a techno song which uses the exact same melody as a sample playing over and over with a pretty fast (propably 130-140) beat behind it. This is pretty much all I got for you. It might even be the exact sample used, it sounds basically the same to me right now. I know it is propably a lost cause to ask for a techno song here, but I still have hope, so a big thank you for everyone who wants to help!!
