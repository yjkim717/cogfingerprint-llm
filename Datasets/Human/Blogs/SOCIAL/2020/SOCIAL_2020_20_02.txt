Looking for a book that has both exercises, audio, and explanations that is comprehensive enough to use as a standalone resource without other supplements. It's easier for me to learn when all the information is condensed into one place so I generally don't need to go back and forth between many resources. I heard Integrated Korean was good but I can't afford to buy both a textbook, workbook, and answer key separately. Alternative all-in-one options I am thinking of getting are Master Korean and Vitamin Korean (the shipping is mad expensive right now, though). Any thoughts on these or other resources that would be a good one-stop to learn/practice Korean?
