I recently discovered this sub and believe I am suffering from noburp. I’m 19 years old and can remember burping maybe 5 times in my whole life. I also definitely have croaking and gurgles. I have anxiety and emetophobia, and the pressure in my chest from gas frequently gives me panic attacks. The excess gas also causes digestive issues. I am considering contacting a doctor from the list. First, though, I wanted to ask you all a question about the Botox experience. Did you experience vomiting after your procedure? That’s the main thing holding me back.
