\[19M\] So basically what the title says, I'm planning on asking out an acquaintance soon and I'm just wondering what the usual routine is. She goes to school in another state and I kind of feel like she has a boy toy back there but she's visiting our hometown for like three months. I'm kind of anticipating the response in the title but idk if I'm really interested in putting in energy if we're just gonna be friends. That's pretty normal when you like someone though, right?
