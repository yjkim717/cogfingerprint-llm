Had a kid just mark every assignment as done and not upload anything... then he proudly emailed me saying that he had caught up with all the late assignments. so i just immediately emailed him back with a screenshot telling him to double check because there was nothing there. I’m wondering if he just think i’m dumb and expects me to make up a grade??
