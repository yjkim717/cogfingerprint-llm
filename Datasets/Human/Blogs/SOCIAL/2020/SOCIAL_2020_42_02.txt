I work in a small neighborhood market. I have a customer who is, judging by the light show he has installed on his bicycle, a meth head. He came in the other night and had a pistol tucked into his belt with his shirt tucked in behind it. I told him I wasn't comfortable with him bringing a gun into my store. He assured me it was perfectly safe and it was open carry and if I happened to be robbed while he was in the store he could shoot the robber. I asked him if the gun was registered, if he had a licence for it. If he went to a shooting range to practice using it? He said, oh yes of course I do. I asked him if I could see his licence and open carry permit. He said no. He then told me a "funny," story about how he almost shot his foot off when the gun went off accidentally. How does someone who has trained with firearms let a gun go off accidentally? But since I am just a lowly worker bee, I have no real authority, so I rang him up and got him out as fast as I could. The next day I told the boss. She has been running this store for thirty years and can tell you the family history of nearly everyone in the neighborhood. This moron spent two years in jail for a failed bank robbery. Who tries to rob a bank on a bike? This guy. The boss told him if he ever brought his gun into the store again, I am allowed to tell him to leave and to call the cops. So far he has left the gun at home. Thanks for reading.
