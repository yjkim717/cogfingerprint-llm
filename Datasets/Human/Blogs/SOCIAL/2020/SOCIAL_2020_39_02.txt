Me and my boyfriend recently got back together after a month of him blocking me. He didn't give an explanation he just left. Up untill that point life has been preaty good we were amazing friends and would talk every single day and talk. He made me feel special and he said i did the same. He made me happy. And then he left for a month with ought saying anything. Before i went to sleep I saw that he added em back on snap and we got started chatting again and it felt so good to be back both of us were so happy to be talking to each other. Apparently he had been bullied and stopped talking to me in hopes that that would make it stop. It didnt. But my question is everything feels so familiar so relaxing however he did leave for a month so i dont know were we stand should i hate him because i dont. I just glad hes talking to me again but should i be concerned its a ploy or that it will happen again? Any of you have experience with this?
