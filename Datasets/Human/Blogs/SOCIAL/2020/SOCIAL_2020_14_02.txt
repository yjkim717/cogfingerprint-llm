Though I came to this realisation today, this has obviously been in the works for a bit. Not the biggest fuck up in the world, but still a hilarious one. I suffer a lot of migraines, all of different levels of severity (from 'hurts like hell but can continue working' all the way to ' puking and curling up in a fetal position crying for 6 hours'). I'm having it looked into medically, but that's another story. After the migraine ebbs away (after passing out or just working through it), I sometimes get myself a burrito to treat myself for a job well done. I never really liked burritos before this, but one day I was craving one after a migraine, and now it's usually my go to post-migraine feed (sometimes with a churro if I really deserve it). After that first burrito, the rest was history. Only problem with this is, because of how often my migraines come, now any time I have a migraine or even a headache, I automatically crave burritos, which doesn't sound like a problem, but now I'm getting a burrito gut and my wallet hates me, plus my stomach hates what all the beans is doing to me. Tl;dr - I pavlov'ed myelf into craving burritos when my head hurts. My stomach, wallet and toilet now hate me.
