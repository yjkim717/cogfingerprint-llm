My fiance is always giving me a hard time for using dollar store headphones when I go on a walk or to the gym. At home I have a very very high end pair of Sennheisers that I work with/audiophile out with, but I have had them for about 10 years and the foam is falling apart (easy to replace, but they work fine and never leave my room so I don't care). For my birthday my fiance told me she was going to get me some bluetooth headphones, I assumed some airpods or something small like that to replace my daily drivers (lol), but she just video chat me from the store for me to help her pick them out, and the ones she's been looking at are full size over the ear, to replace my high end mastering headphones, rather than my budget EDC's. I felt terrible telling her that I would never use them, as she had just spent 45 minutes narrowing down to those two pairs, her phone died right after I saw the light leave her eyes, so now I have no idea if she is going to try to figure out what I wanted, go with the pair I told her not to, or come home empty handed. None of those options make me happy. I feel bad because she is trying, but on the other hand I have explained to her a few times why I still use the Sennheisers and they aren't worth replacing. This is like the third time that someone has tried to get me audio gear that I will never use, and I have to weigh telling them that it's not what I want, or letting them spend money on something I never use, just to save face. Protip: If someone is a professional in a field, don't try to buy them things in that field, without them being physically in the store with you.
