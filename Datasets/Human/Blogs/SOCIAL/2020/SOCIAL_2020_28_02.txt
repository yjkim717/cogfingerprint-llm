So my dad is getting me a PC and a new phone for Xmass and I was wondering what would be better since this will be a PC in my room that will be used for gaming school work and my job would it be best to go with Intel or AMD I've looked at both and both are what I need in terms of specs-wise and before I go to him with a list of parts I want I am asking this question since this is my first time building my own PC thanks in advance what's better is what I am trying to ask in terms of life what last longer.
