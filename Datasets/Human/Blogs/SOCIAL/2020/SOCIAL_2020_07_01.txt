ive grown to actually like the sound of my own voice in videos or voice recordings. i think because i know the people i talk to like what i have to say. so i just enjoy listening to my videos before i send them to my friend(s). is this weird? does this mean im extremely vain if i rather enjoy the sound of my voice? whatever it means, ive spent years just accepting how i sound, and its gotten to the point where im content if thats how i sound to other people.
