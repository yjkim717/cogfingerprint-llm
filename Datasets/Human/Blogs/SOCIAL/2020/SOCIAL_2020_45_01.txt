I've worked from home for fifteen years, and I've learned that one of the most important things you can do to keep up your productivity is to maintain your normal work routine when you're working from home. Get up, do your normal morning routine, get dressed just like you normally would, and dedicate work time to work. Sure, on your breaks you can start a load of laundry or walk the dog, but don't let work life and home life mingle during actual work time. It's not just for keeping work productive: it also prevents the feeling of "always being at work" when the work day is done.
