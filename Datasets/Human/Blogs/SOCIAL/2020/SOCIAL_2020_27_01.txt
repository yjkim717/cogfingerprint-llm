I would like to live in a small house without neighbors. Im not sure what I can afford, usually a week I make $530 take home (some weeks $650 if I work 6 days). All of my bills calculate to $735 a month. Truck payment: $380. Phone: $50 Lot Rent:$305 (I don't pay insurance im on my families plan). I also almost never go anywhere besides work. What should I do? EDIT: I live in PA min wage is $7.25. I just bought the truck and I'm going to refinance in 6 months.
