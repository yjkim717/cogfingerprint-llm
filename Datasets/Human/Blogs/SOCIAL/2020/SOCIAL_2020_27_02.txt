One of my buddies I worked at Fedex as a package handler got his CDL 2 years ago and started hauling steel 5 days a week (home on the weekends). He went 18 wheels and I went to 6 wheels delivering packages residentially for customers. Its good money, bout 950 a week running 6 days, but I'd love to make more than wnat I'm currently making. I was told there are residential jobs where you're home every night. Can anyone give me some advice?
