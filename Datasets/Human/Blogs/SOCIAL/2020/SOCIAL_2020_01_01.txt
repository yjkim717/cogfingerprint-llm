Sorry for wall and forgive me as I’m a noob. This is my 2nd Rocket season. I’m aware I’m very new/bad as I’m around 250+ hours / 47.1 W% / 1 GPMA. I’m ranked at mid-silver average for this season (should be gold/plat of course lol) and I’m really hoping to get a better ranking. Ever since FTP started there has been an onslaught of unranked players that seemingly can be any level of skill. I call it The Smurfening! I just want to play against similar rank players but all I seem to get is unranked. Why aren’t all the unranked just playing each other? I guess we just have to get this process out of the way but I ask the question how long is this re-ranking going to take? I wasn’t playing at the last re-ranking so I’ve no idea. Also why aren’t legacy players forced to have a banner saying what their highest rank was so you have an idea who you’re playing? (It’s frustrating to watch unranked players doing aerial goals off the ceiling and putting many, many goals past me but maybe it’s because I’m bad lol) Also whilst I’m here who’s idea was it to make the Loot Llama Decal the same colour for everyone? I can’t see why it would be a problem for teams that all have the same decal at high speed... Lastly nobody wants italic stuff Psyonix. I’m looking at you Ombre banner and border. Stop trying to make it happen. It just looks weird!
