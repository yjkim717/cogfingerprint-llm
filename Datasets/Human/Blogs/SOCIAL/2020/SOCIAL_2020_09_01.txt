In regards to MEC requirements and meeting the 7 pay criteria, what happens after you've sailed clear of the 7 year period? Like what can you do in year 8 or 9? Can you deposit more than would have been allowed under 7 Pay? I'm gonna ask my IBC professional and see what they say, just was wondering if anyone here knew or had any experience with it beyond the 7 years.
