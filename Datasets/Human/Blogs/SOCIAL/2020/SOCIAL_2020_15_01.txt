Hello, I hope you all can help me out here. My sister recently asked me to help her remember a book from our childhood. She says our childhood because she seems to remember reading the book for school. And if she read it, then most likely I read it as well. So, the only details that she gave me was that the main character swung an axe and embeds the axe to the bone of his leg. She believes that we had to read it for a school project. It seems so familiar to me, and I just canâ€™t place it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. (And my apologies for the potentially bad formatting. Wrote this on mobile).
