Hello! I apologize if this is not the right place to post this. I was wondering if anyone on here knows if orthodontists can or do pro bono work? I live in Southern Oregon and recently became a foster parent. My child is very self-conscious about their teeth, and I completely understand as I had similar issues as a kid and teen. My experience was awful and I had ideations of extremely harmful actions for a very long time due to being uncomfortable in my own skin and other's words. Fortunately, I ended up getting orthodontia from my pediatric dentist for a short amount of time as he and my parents deemed it "unnecessary." Likewise, my child does not "need" orthodontia, but I can relate to how awful she may feel. Her insurance through the state does not cover it. Any suggestions? Should we call around? Start a GoFundMe? Thank you.
