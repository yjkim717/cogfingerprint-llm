Has anyone else tried running this module? It's kind of an odd duck as traditional D&D modules go, because the villain is a Dragonborn Cleric who suffered head trauma, and believes a baby black dragon is an avatar of Tiamat (it isn't, she's just nuts), and that if she raises it she'll be given eggs for each additional head until she can summon Tiamat, and reunite her with Bahumat, to resurrect Io. I love the idea of a Cleric who's suffered head trauma, but I'm not sure what sort of lunacy to put in the place of Io. Any suggestions?
