Blurry vision out of my right eye and prickling sensation as well. These are signs of a stroke right..... but this is infact a migraine. Ive been battling this all day and every sensation is setting my body off in pain After a few hrs in compeleat isolation i was able to manage and get used to my pain and continue on with my day as best as i can while still being in pain. Well my neighbor came over to offer me a sandwich. I wasnt hungry but he made a remark that set me off internaly. It was that i must be feeling better (he knew i had a migraine before hand) if i answered the door as quick as i did. The fact is life goes on even though im in pain. Because pain is a part of my life at this point. I was diagnosed with chronic migraines. I was having 5-6 a week. Went on some meds and it helped for a bit. But now the meds arent working any more. And it frustrates me when people assume you are "better" because you are continuing with life as normal even though everything is NOT NORMAL. I am in pain. So much pain. Its not something that just gets better.
