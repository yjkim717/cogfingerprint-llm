I keep hearing over and over on this and other subreddits the argument that since Facebook bans throwaway accounts, if you use a throwaway account to buy your games on you'll soon be forever locked out of them. This sounds like pure fear mongering to me and blatantly illegal. Is there any precedence of something like this happening?
