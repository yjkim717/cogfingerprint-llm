I hate the McDonald’s closest to my house because they always get my order wrong 9 times out of 10. Also, their drive through takes forever to get through so I used to go inside but since COVID hit I have to wait through the drive through and it takes over half an hour just to receive my food. I always ask for plain hamburgers because I dislike a lot of veggies but they almost always make them with everything and the fries are almost always cold and stale tasting. I once got a 20 pierce that came with 17 chicken nuggets 2 were burnt and one had a bite taken out of it (you could tell it was a bite) also, I have gotten many burgers where they were completely missing a bottom or top bun and one with half of a patty. It’s to the point where I want to check everything before leaving the window but I don’t wanna hold up line so I never do and the drive through is so hard to get through that I’m never able to take anything back.
