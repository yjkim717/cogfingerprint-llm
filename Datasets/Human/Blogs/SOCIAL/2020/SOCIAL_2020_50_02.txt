My current girlfriend (let's call her Janice) dated this dude (let's call him Austin) for roughly 8 months. Their relationship was really serious and they were *strongly* in love with each other. However, their relationship went sour, and she ended up breaking up with him following a string of bad, hurtful things he did to her. After her break-up, me and her grew closer, and got into a relationship. After we got into a relationship, Janice and Austin re-established communication with each-other, and became *really* good friends, to the point where they would hangout once every 2-3 days (me and her hangout every day). But she had no desire to be romantically linked with him again, and was focused on strengthening her relationship with me. Fast-forward a few months later, and Austin's mental health - which has been on a downward spiral ever since he lost Janice - has gotten to a REALLY bad place, and he is now in rehab. He is also not talking to *anyone* besides the health professionals in his rehab facility. Even his brother hasn't spoken to him. For the past week and a half (since he went to rehab), Janice has been really missing him, to the point where she mentions him and has about a 1-2 hour period everyday of missing him. Sometimes this period of sadness lasts even longer, and it only increases day by day. I have been understanding and comforting her (even though I don't personally like her ex-boyfriend), but one of my friends says that the level of closeness the two shared following their relationship was very unusual, and that Janice's longing and missing of Austin might develop into something non-platonic, if it hasn't already. She says it is very unlikely that she is able to entirely seperate her feelings towards Austin as a friend, from her former romantic feelings toward him. She also worries that Janice might be feeling guilty for breaking up with Austin, which will only increase the more she misses him, and lead to dissatisfaction. Should I be concerned that perhaps Janice ISN'T over her ex-boyfriend, and that her feelings will lead to dissatisfaction in our current relationship?
