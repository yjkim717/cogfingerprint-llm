I’ll start with two examples. In second grade I was dress coded for my skirt being too short by my male principal. Imagine being a 40 year old man openly sexualizing a 7 year old. Disgusting. Second, in 7th grade a female teacher told me to pull my wide-ish neck t-shirt in more because a “bra strap” was showing. I explained to her that actually it was only my under tank top strap showing, but she said that it doesn’t matter because it looks like a bra strap. Dress codes are something that have always driven me crazy (maybe because my arms were disproportionately long from 12-14, so the short length being at fingertips rule made me very angry) and I’m out of high school now, but still curious about other ridiculous things girls have been dress coded for!
