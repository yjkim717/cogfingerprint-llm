Kang Daniel and Park Jihyo duet. JUST okay I know, **I know**, I obviously don't mean to force them to do anything and they can do whatever they want with their relationship honestly...but like wouldn't it be cool. I mean, Daniel's soft, whisper-y vocals and her powerful, sassy voice together would be *chef's kiss*. Like I know they'd have to ask konnect's ceo for permission (and idk man that guy seems kinda tough) but even just sharing a stage during some award thing would be so adorable and so amazing. Like them performing "Touchin'" would actually be *insane*. ...soo yeah that. I know it's cheesy and whatever but I can't be the only one who's thought about this lol **also just wanted to point out that I got genuinely confused while writing this because for a minute I was convinced jihyo's surname was "god" lmaoo I'll go now
