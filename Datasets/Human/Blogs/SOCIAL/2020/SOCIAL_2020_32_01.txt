I’ve already asked about this in a different sub, but didn’t know there was a sub that was about this issue. I’ve had these issues for about 6 years, and it got worse. It started as just being dizzy/weak feeling on and off when I got up. But it started getting to where my vision would either blur or have colors, my body would just go weak from the head down and half the time I’d fall. I would have to walk quickly to a couch/chair/bed/the floor, or I’d end up falling. And I knew I’d fall. A few times I’ve had my chest hurt/ have my heart randomly beat very fast. At the time i didn’t correlate it. My mother and I ended up taking me to a neurologist and they diagnosed it as seizures...despite all the scans they did showing just about nothing. I have an appointment with him again on the 21st. Should I try to ask him about this and see if it is actually POTS, or are my symptoms just similar.
