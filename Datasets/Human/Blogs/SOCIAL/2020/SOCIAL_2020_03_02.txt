The wife and I were talking about having some friends over on Monday because most folks we know have the day off. We were thinking of cooking soul food, ribs, collards, cornbread, mac n cheese Etc. Is that an asshole move? I'll say now that cooking soul food is definitely related to it being Martin Luther King Jr's birthday/civil rights movement but also we cook soul food throughout the year and it's one of my favorite things to cook. Also, I feel like it shouldn't matter but we're both caucasians.
