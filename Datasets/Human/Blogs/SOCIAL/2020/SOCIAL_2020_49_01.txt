I’ve never thought about this until recently when I picked up my legacy again. My current sims parents were both actors who made a lot of money and as of yesterday they had both passed away. I realize the lot just goes vacant and eventually filled later but what about any of the funds they had? It would be pretty cool for it to work some thing like an actual family estate. I vaguely remember sims 2 having it but that game is a league of its own. For now I’m just going to have to remember to check their ending lot funds and then just transfer it myself to get around it.
