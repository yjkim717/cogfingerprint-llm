I am very much a mediator when it comes to, for lack of better word opposing mentalities. And as such i am seeing that in the nursing community you absolutely do not want to be worshiped and be thanked relentlessly. I get that. Especialy since that is setting you up to be a casualty your self. But when it comes to those of us who are not able to help out in the same capacity like you. I am seeing you dont need the home made masks, you need proper PPE. So you dont want to be thanked, you dont want home made masks. Those are the only things we are left with that we can offer. Since these are not needed i open the question up to you. What can we do to help YOU out other than staying home. We cant just twiddle our thumbs and think we are helping. Is there something that is actually beneficial. Obvious we cant get you PPE. But there must be something that may make this easier on you.
