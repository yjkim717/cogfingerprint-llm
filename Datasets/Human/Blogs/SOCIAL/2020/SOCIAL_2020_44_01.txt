A discussion in another thread got me thinking: which scenes in the original series always make you emotional? ("Emotional" can mean whatever you want it to mean.) For me, it's when Hakoda's giving orders to his men and Sokka asks, "Dad, what should I do?" and he responds, "Weren't you listening? I said all the *men*..."
