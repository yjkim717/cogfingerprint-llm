My relationship with my boyfriend has been going through a difficult stage for the past few weeks, and whenever I need someone to talk to about it, I almost always talk with my friend Camila. My boyfriend has made a couple of noteworthy mistakes in our relationship, but I still feel like we both genuinely care about each other, the good in our relationship far outweighs the bad, and we genuinely have a chance of working through our issues through communication and understanding. My friend, on the other hand, is suspect of everything my boyfriend does, and insists that I should "punish" him whenever he does something wrong. I've listened to my friend express her opinion about the topic, but it got to the point where her negativity became really excessive, and I told her I didn't want to talk about it anymore. Instead of listening to me, she decided to double down by telling me "y'know, I honestly think you should just leave him. You can do way better!" I got angry with my friend, and left her house. Later on, she called me, and we discussed what happened. I told her that I feel like she should be respectful about when I don't want to talk about my *own* personal life. She said that I owe it to her to hear her out when she has a new point to make (suggesting I leave him), because she has been there for me and listened to me for hours. She then asked me: "if you saw that I had a drug addiction that was killing me, would you stop talking to me about it just because I asked you not to talk about it?" Is my friend right? AITA for getting angry with her?
