There was a game I played as a kid that came out around the time of the first Diablo (1996) that I remember this specifically because Diablo was packaged with this game in a video game Magazine my Dad picked up for us at the time. I cannot recall for the life of me what it was, but it played similar to rocket league in that it had a game mode where you have to lead a ball into a goal. I remember that you could use tethers that shot from your vehicle to grab the balls, and could also use it to clothesline your opponents off their vehicles. I remember a character names Wachowski or something along those lines. I was so young so I am not sure what type of vehicles you used but I always felt like it was similar to the speeders they use on Endor in Star Wars. Sound familiar to anyone?
