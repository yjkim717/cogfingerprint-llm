HELL YES. And here is a whole a*s album of MOVE postcards to celebrate this king. Also have to link this tweet because LOOK HOW GOOD HE LOOKS OMG. Now, not trying to make this about me *at all* but I am so happy to know that I share a birthday with this legend. He is truly so inspiring to me in everything, from skill to work ethic, he's super hardworking and absolutely amazing, I really admire and love himðŸ’“ (Side note, really sorry I couldn't post a proper pic like he deserved but reddit for some reason won't let me do that) Edit: changed twitter link.
