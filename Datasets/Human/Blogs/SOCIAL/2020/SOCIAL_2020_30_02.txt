Since when have there been so many toxic players, i havent been playing much lately, played a few matches today and had my best round ever got 7 kills and a180k dmg in the California, and after my 6th kill this dude just keeps going off about how i suck and i havent been doing anything other than sitting in the back sniping people while they do all the damage....none of this was true i pushed as soon as the round started and literally wiped 2 omahas and a fuso with 6 citadel hits to start the round with 100k dmg in the first 2 minutes and we were down at that point by 2 kills, sailed towards their side and started doing serious damage, eventually had to switch to HE cuz of a DD somewhere near me...guy complained about that, i hate players like this man, just accept the carry once and a while, the guy didnt even suck he just didnt have kills but cant let it go or support a teammate that is literally having the round of his career, i only ever hit 5 kills here i had 7 this was my 1978th match....had a chance for the 8th but this guy wouldnt shut the hell up. The match before this it was some other whiny player on the mic complaining to someone else, why cant players just worry about them selves, and why complain to others when you are down for the dirt nap, clearly 'you' made mistakes and the one alive didnt, man its frustrating playing with people like this, i wanted to put my headset and mic on but i couldnt mid match. These kind of players almost like enforce me to not play as a team, go for wins and just play selfishly and just mute everyone right in the beginning of the match. TLDR - Match of my career ruined by some whiny player on a mic.
