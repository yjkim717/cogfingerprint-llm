Stand name: Nirvana Stand reference: named after the 80s/90s Grunge Alternative Rock band Nirvana PWR: B SPD: D RNG: B PER: D PRC: A DEV: C STAND ABILITY: FEAR MANIFESTATION Nirvana's stand ability allows the stand to absorb & recreate people's greatest fears & reproduce them in it's range of a standard Basketball court. By breathing a person's secreted hormones in through the air, in the form of evaporated body sweat, the stand can recreate the fears of people by releasing a psychogenic drug like gas from the stands skin. Giving the illusion of someone's greatest fears with imagery and auditory hallucinations, making the fears very real to the person affected & leading them to do out of the ordinary actions, such as having a fear of zombies, seeing the zombies eating you, while in actuality what's really going on is you are recreating the feeling of a zombie eating you by viciously ripping yourself apart with your own hands. Everyone having different fears & phobias ,nobody else can see anyone else's fears other than their own. The user can not control who the stand effects in the stands range & only has control of being able to bring his stand in/out. The user ironically enough is a highly trained psychotherapist & has overcome all his fears over the years & is thus unaffected by his own stand. I don't have enough skill to draw a stand design but if someone else can i would be totally fine with it.
