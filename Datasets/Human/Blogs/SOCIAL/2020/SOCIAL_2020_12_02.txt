Due to lockdown there would have been a wave of old players and casual players playing the game more. which is inherently good. but this season im sick to the teeth of it. every game i find myself being paired with trolls and feeders. Yuumi jungle, lillia support, people playing champs for the first time in RANKED. its getting ridiculous and there needs to be a system in place to deal with these people because ive never actually seen anyone get punished for trolling or feeding. ive had junglers that have come top 3 times within the first 5 minutes and walk under toplane tower. is anyone else having issues like this? and if not i assume youre the ones doing all the trolling and feeding
