I’m not really sure how long this has gone on for. But I’ll get comments about my general appearance, about how I need to wear makeup, how I look bland. Comments about my hair and anything I do with it. I try to have it long and someone makes a comment, I attempt to cut it and get told it’s disgusting. Even the color of my hair somehow isn’t right looking and suggested to be dyed. Then get mad when I try to explain, or just end up rolling my eyes because I’m tired of the comments. I constantly get told I don’t dress “appropriate” for my age, and that’s a reason why people think I’m like 15/16 when I’m 2 days from being 23. I like graphic tee shirts, I don’t see what their issue with that is. I don’t like to dress up. That things I like, such as Pokémon, are for children and that I need to grow up. Tell me that I need to speak up/be more extroverted, the moment I do, people get annoyed by the change or think I’m yelling/have a bad tone. Why can’t people just mind their own business? It’s ok to talk to someone and help them here and there with some of those things, but for people to constantly make remarks like that only chips at someone’s self esteem. I don’t want to change for anyone and be myself, but that only brings unwanted comments. Why do people really feel the need to do this kind of thing?
