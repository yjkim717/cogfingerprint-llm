\[Throwaway so my family doesn't track me down\] So I am a 16-year-old male living with my dad and my sister. So this happened yesterday I was attending a movie night in discord while my sister and my dad were off doing other things, so I turn my head to the left and stared at a photo that was hung in the hallway since the movie we where watching had a very naughty seen so I closed out and looked away and then my sister walked by and looked where I was looking and started screaming stop looking at me, which I didn't know since I had headphones on then my dad gets into the mix still mind you I still had headphones on and starts yelling at me when I saw him walk to me I took off my headphones, says I need to get off the computer or pay attention to the screen and that I need to go back on medication, so I start getting pissed off and I screaming what the fuck did I do and then I stormed off and stopped talking to my family So Reddit am I the AITA? Edit do to my autism I have issues with English and I am trying to read and add comas Edit 2 removed some useless stuff Edit 3: With my autism, I have panic attacks when I am being yelled at and then I tend to yell back instead of going straight to my coping skills like play with the dog who tends to calm me down and I now know I should have gone to my copping skills instead of yelling.
