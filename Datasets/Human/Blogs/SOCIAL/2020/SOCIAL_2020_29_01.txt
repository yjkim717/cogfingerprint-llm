It really pisses me off how the school system tries to fix personal loss or grieving by saying some stupid shit, like they would want you to move on or I know how you feel but, just try not think about it. When in reality you didn't know them and most likely you don't give a shit about me or my feelings and say this to 8 other people that same week or that they have a personal false idealism on the relationships between family members and that every family member in some way cares about each other when in reality there are are a good amount of people who had a bad relationship with their family/family member. It's the consolation equivalent of putting band aids on bullet holes.
