Going to my FIL's wedding in less than 2 weeks. I had a dress idea saved, but can't find it now. Looking for a nursing dress (zipper near breasts). Preferably no cinches. I love the knee or above knee look abd feel, but open to other suggestions. Preferred colors would be sky blue/blues, mint/greens, tie dye (or white that I can dye), or grey/black. Please help me!:)
