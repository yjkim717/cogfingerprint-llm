I was watching Barack’s eulogy of John McCain, and was surprised that he took a detour to discuss the fact that McCain had a short fuse and bad temper. I was caught off guard, and felt it was disrespectful to talk badly about someone you’re eulogising. But honestly, this isn’t the first time I’ve noticed such a thing happen. Why do eulogies sometimes mention bad things/qualities about the person they are eulogising?
