I just started an 8 week acting class last Tuesday, and so far I love it, but I already can tell that I am more confident when I play a silly/goofy character like Chris Pratt than I am with more "serious" acting. I probably should've taken an improv class, but I am here and want to make the most of it. Reason I am asking this question, is that we have an assignment for next class where we need to observe a stranger in public, and replicate their physical mannerism. The only rules were that it needs to be a real person we observed, and we cannot speak. I want to mimic a person I saw playing fetch with their dog at the beach, but I wanted to "jazz" it up so to speak by over exaggerating my facial expressions when I "praise" the "dog" to possibly get a laugh. I was going to mouth out a clear "I love you" to empty air while making goofy faces at nothing. I am putting a lot of practice in getting down the movements, and the silly bit with my face is just going to be something I do at the end. Would this be too much? I don't want the instructor to think I am not taking the class seriously, but I also went into this to learn how to entertain, so I naturally want to incorporate my own personality into this. Would I be missing the point on this exercise by doing that?
