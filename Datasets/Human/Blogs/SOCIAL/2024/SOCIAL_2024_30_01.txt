I’ve been sure that she’s been slandering my name and talking behind my back towards other people in my family for a long time, she’s been my mental abuser for my entire life and today I caught her red handed because she sent me a text meant for someone else (sorry wish I could upload the screenshot) I did talk to her and it was a normal morning/afternoon of having minimal communication but still told her what I was doing and where I was going and then this message “(Me) isn’t even talking to me today. Like it’s all my fault 🤦🏽‍♀️ It’s amazing how much people hate Republicans and feel they’re horrible people without morals. Really sad.” I can be a hot head so I immediately let it get to me but really it just proved to me one and for all, all my prior suspicions and sent her this in return, I’m just so tired of this I want to end it and be at peace I can’t take it anymore. I have no one. “What the fuck is this, I not once blamed you for any of this but clearly you like to gaslight me towards other people for self validation”
