[M25] I've been on a fair few dates in the past few years trying to find "the one" and with the past few people I keep finding myself getting hurt because the people I find interest in always end up pulling away for some reason or another. I'm not pushy, I'm not abusive, I take care of myself (gym, diet, read, work, balance hobbies), I listen, I care, I dont obsess, I make time, I do everything to make a good relationship work by being a good man, but I always get hit with "Its not you, its me" or I get ghosted entirely. Its just getting tiring putting myself out there only to get kicked back down. I guess that's life but damn sometimes I'm tired of even trying. I always hear guys say things like "girls don't want to settle down in their 20s" and to be honest I'm starting to see the patterns.
