Hey all, as the title states I am looking for books/articles/essays on the subject of musical aesthetics for my thesis. I started off with the book Strange Tools by Alva NoÃ« which was rwcommended to me by my professor. After reading it, I expressed to him that I disagreed on multiple points made in the books, specifically its section on music, which prompted him to encourage me to explore this topic further. However, I've only been in uni for two years and I have only a very vague idea of this field (which seems as broad as it is fascinating) and that's why I'm asking for recommendations. I would appreciate both books that present a general overview of musical aesthetics (main ideas/questions and thinkers) and more specific ones, if possible on the relationship between art/music and complexity and/or on what separates "good" art/music from the rest. I would especially appreciate recent works (2nd half of the 20th century and onwards) as my professor is adamant that most of the things written before are too outdated for me to truly find them useful/stimulating. However, if you have good recommendations that were written earlier I would still appreciate them, as I feel a bit lost and really need solid reference points. Thank you in advance!
