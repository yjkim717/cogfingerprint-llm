Hi guys… I just finished my third full play-through of horizon zero dawn and second of the frozen wilds. I have been considering getting a ps5 for a while so the last time I completed the game I thought to myself I’d just wait until I’d get a ps5 to play horizon forbidden west to be able to experience it to its fullest extend. But now after the third time, I’m not even so sure I’m gonna get a ps5 anytime soon since I don’t game that much anymore in general and for everything else, my ps4 pro does more than well enough. So now I’m wondering if I should just get horizon forbidden west on ps4 so I can finally get the continuation of the story! What do you guys think? Is it that much worse on the ps4? Is it on par with HZD on ps4? Is it better/worse than HZD on ps4? What is the big difference between HFW on ps4 or ps5? What would you do? Would love to hear your opinion!
