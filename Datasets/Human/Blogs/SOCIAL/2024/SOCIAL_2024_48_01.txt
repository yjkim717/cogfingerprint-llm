I have lots of reasons for not wanting kids, but the “summarized” version is this: I don’t think that I will provide them the life I believe they deserve. I live in America and I’m fairly leftist, so of course, I’m not super thrilled with how things work here But recently I had an argument with my parents about this. It started from something innocuous: I go to a gym and there’s a couple of kids who take the “advanced” Muay Thai class. I was telling my mom that I thought it was funny how little they’ve changed since I was a kid — I was wearing a league of legends shirt and one of the kids said “I heard people on that game are really toxic” and I thought it was funny She was like “see? You do like kids. You should have kids” I had to explain to her it’s much more complex than just “not liking kids”. I brought up financials and she’s like “you can afford it”, and I replied with the fact that I’d have to move to the suburbs, which is not where I’d want a kid to grow up. Also, how am I gonna afford college for a kid? It’s increasingly inaccessible My mom then went on a tirade about how no one should ever need college. I said “I don’t want my potential kid to be precluded from the possibility of pursuing what they’re passionate about”. She’s like “just have them go into the trades or something”. I feel like it isn’t my place to tell my potential kid what _they_ should do with _their_ life. If they wanna go into the trades, that’s great, but what if they’re really smart and wanna be a doctor or a mathematician? What then? Of course she just got mad and said that I’m thinking way too much about it. … yeah? I’m bringing life into this world, and I’m responsible for it for 18 years. No shit I’m not going into it lightly I know there’s probably hundreds of these rants already but it just pisses me off
