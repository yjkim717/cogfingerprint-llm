I want to adopt a chihuahua, I had one as my childhood pet and I miss her everyday. But I'm a little bit worried because I currently have a schnauzer and I was told since they have high prey drive they wont do with chihuahuas. Does anyone have any experience with this? Is it even true or are they just exaggerating? Any tips when introducing them?
