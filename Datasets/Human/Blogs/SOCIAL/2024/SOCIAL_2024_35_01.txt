This is Ninja. Ninja has tried a wide variety of cat foods. Ninja likes dry kibble, and Ninja typically hates wet food. When he was young, the only food we could find that he would eat was Whiskas. This was not healthy. Ninja got fat. We tried mixing other foods into the Whiskas, he would feed any other food mixed in to the dog. Then, he randomly decided he did not like the Whiskas. We tried a wide variety of foods, as he would rather starve than eat, and discovered he liked the Purina One turkey flavour. A bit better than the Whiskas, and he was actually eating his food instead of whatever else he could find (elastics and wires) so it was a win. We managed to get him down from 25 pounds to 19 on the Purina, but he stopped losing weight at that point. Then I discovered Tiki Cat. Tiki Cat is much healthier, the first wet food he has even tried in his 10 years of life, which he enjoys (the dog tried many wet foods) and have a dry kibble he goes bonkers for. He has been on this new diet for half a month, and has lost about half a pound. He should be somewhere in the 9-11 lbs range. Still has a ways to go, but happy to have finally found something this picky guy will eat that is actually good for him. This guy has tried almost every food the grocery store has to offer, and many higher end foods. Hundreds have been spent trying to find something healthy he will eat. Tiki Cat claimed even the pickiest of eaters will like their food, and having an incredibly picky eater, I can confirm this claim is true. The only one upset is the dog, mainly because there are no cat snacks anymore.
