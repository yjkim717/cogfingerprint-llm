Coworker and I left our place near rouse hill at 7am to drive to work in the city, and we were still on the M7 at 9am. We never made it to work, and instead are working out of a friendâ€™s place after we realised we were going to be 2+ hours late to work. What happened in the M2/M7 this morning? Is everyone okay?
