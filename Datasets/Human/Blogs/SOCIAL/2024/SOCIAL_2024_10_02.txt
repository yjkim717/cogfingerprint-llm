One of my favorite things about the city is the greenery everywhere, Most capital cities do not have large trees \*everywhere\* like Hanoi does/did. I haven't been around the city yet today, but I am worried about how many will be gone and the 10 years or so it will take to regrow them if they are even replaced.
