So last week my house caught fire and living so far out it couldn't be saved. I had to emergency find a new home with a co-worker and now with a 500 dollar rent (which is by no means bad) I had to make the tough decision to quit voice therapy. Ever since then I feel my voice depressing from where it was, but honestly don't think I was ever doing it right. Still I miss it but it was nesscary to give up on, because with a medical bill in the 400 and a 500 rent, combined with anything else I really have nowhere to go.
