Hey y'all, so I'm on week 4/8 of orientation in a completely new specialty. I've noticed some things about the new job that are giving me some pause and wanted to see what y'all think. For context, I am a nurse with 1 year of adult critical care experience transitioning to a level 4 NICU. * Right off the bat, 8 weeks seems really short for a completely new to specialty orientation. The position I applied for and accepted was one specifically made for nurses without peds or NICU experience. They said 8 weeks is standard and extending it isn't an option. * There are apparently big changes coming that I knew nothing about. It's a large unit that's soon going to be divided in two. We will all still be managed by the same manager and will have 1 charge nurse for the 2 units i.e. nothing will really change about the day to day--but I'll have to pick which one I want to be on. One side will have preemies and the other side will have surgical babies and trach kids. I don't know enough yet to know which I prefer, and I worry that I won't be well rounded. * My preceptor. I like her, but she's traded away almost half of our shifts together so I've been stuck with random people who clearly didn't know they were gonna have an orientee until the morning of. We only have 2 more weeks together before I go to nights so I guess it's not that big of a deal, but it's bugging me because I feel like it's hindered my growth being with random people who don't know me all the time. I get that no orientation is perfect and things happen, but she's INTENTIONALLY traded away HALF of our shifts. I don't know, I'm gonna finish out my orientation and try to give it some time but I just have a bad feeling about this. Am I overreacting?
