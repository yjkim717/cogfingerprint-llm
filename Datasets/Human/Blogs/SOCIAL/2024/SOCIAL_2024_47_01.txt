Hi everyone. I usually like to listen to hard techno or some more groovy stuff but years ago when I first got into electronic music, I loved me some good "deep" tech house (if you could even call it that, I don't wanna start arguing about sub-genres now.) So yesterday, I was skimming through some compilations to find some nice Groove Tracks for a gig I have on the weekend and I found this track here and boy oh boy has this track relit some almost forgotten memories!! And now I've been trying to find some more like it but since the artist himself doesn't really producy anything like it usually, I haven't been all too lucky so far... I just love the simple drums, the bass, the vocoded voice, it's so simple yet effective imo... Can anyone here give me some hints where I could find some more? (Maybe also some of the old OGs, would love to take some more trips down memory lane.. Much love to you all! <3
