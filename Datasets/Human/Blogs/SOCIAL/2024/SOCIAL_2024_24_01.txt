The majority opinion among good players seems to be that camping the wildcats at spawn is wasting the vehicle, as the enemy pilots will know where you are and parts of the map won't be defended at all. After watching many youtube videos, hammering home the point that the Wildcat should constantly be moving, I've come to a different conclusion. Especially from the perspective of a pilot on the same team. At least one wildcat should always stay at spawn. The reason for that is simple: If you're moving around, the enemy might not know where you are but your teams pilots (and drivers) won't either. In my opinion the wildcat is not just meant to shoot down vehicles, but to provide a no fly zone. Vehicles need to have a safe zone where they can retreat to when harassed by jets and helis and a wildcat can provide that. But for that to work properly, the wildcat has to be stationary. That's why I'd argue that one wildcat should move around, to provide cover for the whole map and another should stay at spawn and protect it. What do you think? I also think wildcats are literally too weak, but that's a different discussion.
