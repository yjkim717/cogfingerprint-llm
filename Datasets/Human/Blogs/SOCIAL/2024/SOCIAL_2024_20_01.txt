Relaxing at home is nearly impossible because it's so loud here (barking and construction noises) and I can't sleep in. I'm burnt out af at work and am saving my PTO/money to travel later, so I really need to just stay at home and recover. But I feel like it's a waste if I use them and am just stressed at home "relaxing" anyways because I still have to listen to the same fucking sounds all day. I hate it here
