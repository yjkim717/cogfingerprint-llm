I think I've mentioned this in past posts, but with the 1931 Dracula and Frankenstein entering the public domain in 2027, I'm working on a spin-off novel (if people like it I might do more) that's intended to examine how the UM universe works in a way the films never really did (the two questions I set out to answer in this book were "what happened to Dracula's Brides?" And "How is Dracula related to his children?") My concern, as of now, is that with me codifying rules about this universe, it's starting to lean more towards Dark Fantasy than Horror. My question: Are there any things I need to avoid that you as a fan would consider disqualifying in a Universal Monsters novel?
