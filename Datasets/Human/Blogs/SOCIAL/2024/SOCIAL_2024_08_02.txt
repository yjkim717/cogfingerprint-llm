I'm being sincere. For awhile, everytime I cook with beef, I get a craving for a really sweet sugary beef, and it came across my mind, if I could just make beef candy or something, similar to how you can make candied peanuts. But I don't want to waste ingredients for an instinctual craving, so I want to know ahead of time. Can I candy some lean beef?
