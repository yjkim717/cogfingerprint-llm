Each season just got gradually worse imo. The storylines and character arcs just weren't hitting. I dont really know how to explain it. What i also notice is when a new season drops, the internet just explodes and its everywhere. I saw so many Eddie Munson thirst traps i really started hating the character. It makes me think the internet feels like this is one of the greatest shows of all time, and to me i wouldn't even really put it in my top 10,I like it, but i just don't get the hype, and i think seeing all the hype around it but then not thinking it lives up to the hype its getting makes it seem worse in my eyes. Amazing shows have come, gone, and ended during the duration of Stranger Things but its nowhere near the scale of what you see on a new Stranger Things season. Snowfall being one of the top examples
