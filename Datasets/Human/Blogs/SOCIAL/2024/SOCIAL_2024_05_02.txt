32m — 6’3” / 185 pounds. I’ve been walking 5 miles everyday for the last 6 months, went from 200 to 185lbs, but haven’t been lifting weights. When I saw my parents they actually gave me money to buy food and kept making comments how I need to eat. I felt like I look great in my eyes, but I also have friends that are showing concerns as well. They keep making comments on how I need to start lifting weights. Do I really look that bad?
