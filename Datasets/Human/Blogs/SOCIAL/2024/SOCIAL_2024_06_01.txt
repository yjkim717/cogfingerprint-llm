Had some asshole throw something at my car on the way to work and it smashed my windshield… I wasn’t paying enough attention to what car they were driving and they were going the opposite way from me on a two-way with a lot of traffic behind them so I also couldn’t get a plate number… Worst of all, my car is long out of production with not a lot of demand for replacement parts, so the windshield cost just shy of my deductible and I have to use the money I was saving for a trip next month for that. Today’s lesson, get a dash cam for ALL of your vehicles. There’s always gonna be that one asshole or dumbass driving on the road with you.
