Twitter has become such a disgusting website it's a true marvel. The worst people on the planet pay to have their brain dead garbage pushed to the top of search, replies, everything; The majority of fun and interesting people are gone or not active anymore while most activity on the site is driven by monetization-motivated triple-comment chatGPT replies and sexbot likes. Dead Internet Theory is a fact on Twitter. The bird app has died and what we're left with is the bastard child of facebook and 4chan. Oh you want to know what this trending topic is about? To bad, bluecheck user "HitlerRapist1488" paid to have his crypto scam displayed front and center. "X" marks the spot at the bottom of the bottomless pit that is the breakdown of community and information on the internet. Twitter isn't just worthless to advertisers, it has negative value. No brand with a sense of self-preservation is going to push their phones, soft drinks or whatever next to groyper racism memes and AI generated clickbait long-form drivel. Elon Musk is the worst thing that can happen to anything that's even remotely good. The Apartheid-prince systematically dismantled everything that made twitter great. But in the end that's why I'm happy how the site turned out. Twitter has truly become the website he deserves.
