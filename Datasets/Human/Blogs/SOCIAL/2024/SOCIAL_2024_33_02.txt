I used to love subways meatball sub but the last time I had it, the sauce was full of tomato chunks. I’m assuming they changed the recipe like they changed a whole bunch of other things. I understand that the sauce is probably made of tomato’s but it’s not the taste that’s the issue. I have ARFID really back and whenever I bite into a chunk of tomato I forcefully gag uncontrollably and lose my appetite. Before you insult me I understand that they aren’t going to cater to everyone and I understand that isn’t possible but I’m just wondering if there’s a way to get the meatballs without the chunky sauce like they used to ? The answer is probably no but I just thought I’d ask.
