I played as Karlach, and romanced Shadowheart. I just felt like Karlach would 100% be into Shadowheart, and would recognize her lonliness and try to help. She supported her thru her entire companion quest, and they had a fantastic romance. Now I didn't know I could change Shadowheart from trickery cleric, and by the time I found out I was far into act 3 and it was the only build I knew. I thought Karlach would feel bad leaving her lover behind, but Shadowheart couldn't land a hit to save her life, and believe me, it alongside the others needed saving. So I did the only logical thing, and decided if she couldn't hit anyone, at least she would survive. I built her to have a base AC of 24. I gave her spells to increase it. Nobody could hit her. Nobody could stop her. My whole party would die and she would just take out everyone one by one before asking Withers to save them. She still couldn't land a hit to save her life, but hey, she was alive and eventually the enemies would run out of spell slots and healing potions and I had to land some hits. I did my entire playthru with trickery domain Shadowheart being the center of all my battle plans. Trickery domain Shadowheart was my MVP, and in every single encounter from start to finish. She never swapped out. I had no idea trickery domain was such a meme.
