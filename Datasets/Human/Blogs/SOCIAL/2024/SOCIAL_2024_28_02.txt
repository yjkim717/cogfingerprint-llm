So I end up drinking way too much on a Saturday every week since I turned 21 and I need advice to learn how to cut back I like drinking it's just I don't want to develop an addicton. And it becomes an everyday thing that's what I'm scared of the most because addiction runs in my family. And where I'm at there's a big drinking culture so I want to go from once a week to social events at work. then to hardly drinking. How did you y'all cut back.
