I hate it, I hate it, I hate windows when I’m trying to work and I hate sunlight in my bedroom, natural light belongs outside and outside only, inside is for artificial warm light, it’s driving me insane. I have intraocular implants because of cataracts and so it may be glare but I don’t think it’s only glare. Part of it is how cold the light is, it’s not warm light. I just hate it… please Reddit help me i don’t know why I’m like this and I’m going to have a breakdown
