Seriously it’s painful how much you suck Epic… - Lovely engaged people that show they care on stream for a long time - Great interactions between chat and devs - Not a one-off they often do gaming streams - Great comms, pr, advertising of them, the company and their games - 2 YEAR roadmap of various games with an actual plan - Lots to look forward to like new games, updates and modes… - Ghost Ship is awesome and I would fight for them Please just copy them you cheap, greedy, crappy company. Try being nice for literally once. It’s not hard just copy Ghost Ship. Honestly you don’t deserve the fandom you have in Rocket League. To everyone here unfortunately This is Rocket League! But if you want to play a great game from awesome devs then I’ll see you in the DRG mines of Hoxxes IV. Rock & Stone bros and brothers! Oh and before I forget… #FUCKEPIC BECAUSE GSG ARE MAKING THEM LOOK BEYOND TRASH TODAY
