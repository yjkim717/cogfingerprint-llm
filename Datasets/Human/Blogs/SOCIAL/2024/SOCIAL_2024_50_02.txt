Between Biden’s horrible debate performance, concerns around his age, and the recent PR from Trump’s assassination attempt, I don’t see how Biden wins this election. The democratic party is fractured and has done a huge disservice with all the calls for Biden to step down, whereas the republicans seem much more galvanised about their candidate. Is Trump’s win essentially gauranteed at this point? Or is there still reason to believe Biden could win?
