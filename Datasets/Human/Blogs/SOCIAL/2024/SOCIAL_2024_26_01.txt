I have just started with photography and I am afraid that I will run out of storage in my hard drive if I keep saving the originals. Buying more storage is not an option, since I am on a very tight budget. I understand that if I want to reduce the file size, the quality and/or size of the image will be affected. I just want to know what is the right way to do it. Should I resize the image, or keep the size but lower the resolution? I am honestly lost, and if this is not the right place to ask please guide me in the right direction. Thank you!
