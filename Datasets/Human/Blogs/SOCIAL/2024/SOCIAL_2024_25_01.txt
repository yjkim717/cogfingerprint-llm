Does anyone still play SoulCalibur V on PS3 in 2024? I recently reinstalled the game and grinded up to level 85. I looked into playing online matches and couldn't find anyone. Idk if the servers still exist for this game. This is my favorite SC game cuz Devil Jin's moveset from Tekken is in the game. I'd love to play this online but it looks like the game is dead. I know the devs took the game off the market due to copyright issues or something like that but I can still download and install this game from my account's transaction history. If you have this game on your PS3, let's bring it back to life! And yes, you can still download DLC you've purchased on your account. While I'm here, does anyone have an account I can borrow for the Dark Knight Gauntlets? I didn't preorder this game as I discovered it originally through KaggyFilms YouTube channel
