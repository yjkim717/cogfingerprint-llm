With any other site I would consider this an embarrassing question, but since it’s Goodreads it’s just another pile of garbage on the landfill of terrible UI decisions. I can mark books as “Currently reading” but I can’t seem to actually input what page I’m on. Is this even a feature on the mobile site?
