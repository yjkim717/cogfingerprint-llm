First and foremost I want to say that I will be the first person to be suspicious of straight men being attracted to and still respecting the gender of pre-transition or fem presenting partners, this question is not in regards to that. My question centers more around individuals (like myself) who have transitioned and clearly don't *look* like a woman/changed our name/etc but still receive attention from seemingly straight men and why that may be. Is it the exoticism aspect of us? Is it truly that we're still seen as women that can be changed? I ask because I've been struggling/wondering this as a straight coworker has been flirting with me for months but has only known me post transition. (Respects my name and automatically used he/him pronouns for me). I'm not a manly person by any means, I would say I'm more androgynous, but I still go into the office with stubble sometimes and wear men's clothing/suits/etc. I've never come out to him but he knows I'm trans (has me on social media), BUT this also isn't the first time a straight guy has expressed some degree of interest in me post transition and I know I'm not alone in this. I just want to know what takes other people have on this because I genuinely don't believe guys that can be into us are "a little gay", I feel like it's something else. Any thoughts are welcome and please feel free to disagree with me on anything!
