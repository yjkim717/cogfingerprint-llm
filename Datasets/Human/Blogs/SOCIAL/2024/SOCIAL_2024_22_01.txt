I don't really have a say in what type of oven i get, as I'm currently homeless and this apartment that's becoming available is the only one I qualify for in 1 1/2 years of not having a place of my own. P.S. Also, drop your Favorit recipes for me to try out. I'm thinking of making Sweet Water Noodles as my first dish to "christen" my parents and first REAL kitchen.
