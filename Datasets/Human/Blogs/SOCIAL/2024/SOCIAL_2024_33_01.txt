So there’s this store near me that has. She’s planted at the enterance and exit of their parking lot. I have a smaller car and the bushes are so tall that I can’t see oncoming traffic when pulling out. If I pull foward enough past the bush to be able to see then I’ll be halfway in rhetorical road already. I try avoiding that store as much as possible but it’s one of those stores that has things you can’t buy anywhere else around.
