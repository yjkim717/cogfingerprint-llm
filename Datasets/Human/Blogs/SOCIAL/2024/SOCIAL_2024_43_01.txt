We have work people coming over Friday and most of them have never even heard of sous vide and I was wanting to try some kind of apps I can set out with sliced ribeye on them perhaps or similar? Or I'm open to anything that can be made in sous and then be made into some upscale food I can serve. Thanks all in advance!
