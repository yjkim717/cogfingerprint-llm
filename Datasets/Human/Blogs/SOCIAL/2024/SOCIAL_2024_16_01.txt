So for context I work for a grocery store in the To-Go area, two days a week for a total of 8 hours a week. Well this arrangement was fine up until I graduated from college, in which I began to look for a new job in my field of study, which I will be starting tomorrow. Now I gave them a two weeks heads up that I will be starting my new job tomorrow, and as part of it I will be required to work alternating weekends. I'm fine with working there still as jobs are screamingly hard to come by right now, and my hours at my new job are also very awkward. So leading up to today they have been trying to wrap their heads around the fact that my availability has changed. Followed by trying to guilt trip me into not changing them because I agreed to work the weekend and they make the schedule a month in advance. Which according means I didn't give them enough notice about my availability changing. They give us our schedule week to week BTW just like every single other job does that's entry level. At this point I have a strong feeling that I'll probably be let go eventually, it seems like they don't have anyone lined up to take over permanently for me. Which I get given no one wants to work Saturday and Sunday late shift. Yet at this point it isn't my problem anymore, they can figure it out on their own as I'll be choosing my new job over this one if it comes to that.
