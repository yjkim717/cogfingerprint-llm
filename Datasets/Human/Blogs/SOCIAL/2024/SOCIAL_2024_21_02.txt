Your first place is your home, your second place is your work (or I guess school, but school can also be a third place sometimes). Your third place is casual, and you don't have to worry about keeping up appearances or being productive or anything like that. It is somewhere that rank/status/background don't matter innately and you are free to socialize with others on an even playing field. Examples are bars, coffee shops, libraries, public parks, etc.
