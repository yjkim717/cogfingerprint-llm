Hey all, I hope this question is suitable for this subreddit, if not I apologize in advance. So I just gifted my mom a Samsonite bag (Karissa biz 2.0 I think) and it's got the "Easy pass" system, so essentially the bag has an internal USB cable which is supposed to be connected to an internal power bank so that you can charge your laptop on the go. Now I've tried plugging it in but nothing indicates that it's charging or anything and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or if the bag just doesn't work. I haven't been able to find any videos on this specific product, so if anyone has any insight to share I'd be very grateful since it means a lot to my mom. Thank you in advance This is the model I'm referring to
