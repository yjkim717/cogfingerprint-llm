I know this is a stupid question. My mother has always free fed the dog and cats we've had. I've been trying to limit it the best I can with food as some are getting chunky. A dog trainer we had for a consolt for my dog said food should be limited. Thing is that my step dad got it in his head that we need to limit their water intake as they, at times, have accidents. Peeing on a pad that we sometimes have down. Asked out loud why someone peed on it right after putting water in the dish. Got screamed at by him saying that the trainer told us to restrict/schedule water and food. No one has ever said to restrict water. And it makes no sense to do such.
