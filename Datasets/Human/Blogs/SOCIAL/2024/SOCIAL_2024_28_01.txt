Long story short, my dad’s older and his body is starting to shut down and it’s in the process of dying. I have to take off Friday and Thursday because of it. So me and my dad can spend some father and son time it’ll put me under my hour cap by 10 hours does it take 2 points or just 1 if I’m under the cap.
