Gonna try and keep this incredibly brief. I was an R&D intern for 3 years at a medical device company while doing undergrad. When I finished university they said "we'd love to hire you but we just don't have any openings". I've stayed in contact with them for the last 9 months (since graduating) and I've been in and out of some kinda crap field service jobs. I am really at the end of my wits after applying for over 400 jobs in that time (I stopped counting after 400). Said medical device company has a technician opening and I would be almost guaranteed to get in since I was an intern for 3 years. Should I just do it? Am I gonna be stuck as a technician forever? It feels really bad to be working as a technician when I have an engineering B.S. I'm starting to feel like the degree itself, was in fact, B.S..
