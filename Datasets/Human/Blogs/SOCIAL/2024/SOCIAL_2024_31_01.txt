Sorry if this post isnâ€™t allowed here My friendâ€™s cat escaped from his house , I imagine through his front door. Taro, the cat, has not been found yet, after almost 7 hours. Heâ€™s just a small little boy. Just over 1 year old and physically small too. Just the idea of him in the cold and shivering out in the -4 cold and snow, and he is probably so scared. Hypothermia can be painful and thatâ€™s the last thing I wanna think about ðŸ˜­Heâ€™s an indoor cat, never been out doors like this. I used to live with the cat, was almost my cat. I was the only one who could really pick him up and hold him etc. Taro loves to play and Iâ€™d play with him even at 2 am, just so he wasnâ€™t bored. Iâ€™m a late sleeper so there was no issue at all. I love Taro so much. Just thinking about the crazy little guy out there has me almost in tears here. Iâ€™m also in a different city for Christmas so itâ€™s even worse. I pray to God that heâ€™s okay and will come back soon. Thereâ€™s his litter box and food out there, from what my friend told me. I just wanna know that Taro is safe
