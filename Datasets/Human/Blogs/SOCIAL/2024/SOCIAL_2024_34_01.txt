looking for swimwear that has a for love and lemons vibe. I know they have some swim suits, but they just aren’t as frilly as their lingerie. I feel like I’ve looked through every major swim brand (like frankie’s bikinis, blackbough, etc) and they just don’t quite have what I want. Looking for some independent designers or a brand that I somehow missed that makes super frilly, lacey, and/or cute bows on bikinis.
