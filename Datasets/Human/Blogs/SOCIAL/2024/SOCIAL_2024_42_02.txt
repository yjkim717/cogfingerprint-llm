Every day for nearly a year. Let's keep it simple and say 300 days. Her dad tells her he painted his workshop white. Too white. She needed to paint something beautiful for him. Then every night, her dad and brother would photograph her work then re-paint it white. That's 600 layers of paint. Seriously! How thick is 600 layers of paint?? At what point would the layers just peel off and bury her alive?
