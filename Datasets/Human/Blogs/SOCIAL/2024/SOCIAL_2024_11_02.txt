Hi all, My name is James, and I just signed up for a walk that supports the non-profit AIM at Melanoma. This is a super personal battle for myself as I was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma about 2 years ago. When I was first diagnosed, one thing that really stuck out to me was how my dermatologist described it to me. She said "It's not a death sentence anymore." This is when I realized just how serious of a disease melanoma was. I am still in the process of fighting this disease. My last scans after my second surgery were clear, but new scans are coming in about a week. I'm hoping to raise some funds for this organization that not only contributes to research against melanoma, but also strives to educate people on how to approach living life with melanoma. Thank you all!
