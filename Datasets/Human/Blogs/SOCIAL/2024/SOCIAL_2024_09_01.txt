This is pure speculation on my part. Let's say for the sake of this discussion that the remains found in the lift station yesterday do belong to Caleb. We have three possible scenarios on how his body got to the lift station without it being placed there. 1. Accident 2. Murder 3. Suicide Suicide would seem like the least likely scenario because he had been planning the upcoming day. If you're going to kill yourself your calendar is free. P Murder is a potential option, but for this discussion let's assume it was an accident. The problem one runs into is why. Why would Caleb randomly walk out to a field in the dark barefoot? We may never know. But let's assume he did. If he did walk out into that field and fell into the storm sewer it's possible he suffered a major head or spine trauma that either paralyzed him or killed him pretty quickly. If that happened he would have been pretty near the bottom of the open manhole until a large volume of water pushed his body towards the lift station. It's also possible that his phone was destroyed when he fell in and if he was immobilized he would have been unable to call for help. It's also possible he was alive and cried out, but no one could hear him. I hope that's not the case. As far as why he walked into the field? Discounting foul pay, he perhaps could have had a medical emergency or been stoned out of his mind and just wondered off into the dark.
