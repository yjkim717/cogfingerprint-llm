I previously posted about needing help with finding the D variants of nickels from 1962-64. I didnâ€™t realize but the mint was located on the reverse side (ðŸ˜ž). I got a box and therefore completed that section! The only coin I am now looking for is the one circled above. I did a search; is it true that for 1995, those nickels will always have a D or P? Does the nickel as circled above even exist? During my search of the box of nickels I got, I only saw 1995 nickels with a D or P. Any additional help is appreciated!
