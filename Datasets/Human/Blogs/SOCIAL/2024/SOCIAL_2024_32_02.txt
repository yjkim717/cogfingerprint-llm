I have been getting calls from this number for a bit now. It leaves an automated message saying they have important info on my account. It's the same robotic voice each time. I've checked my account and nothing appears to be wrong. I can use my card and nothing appears to be wrong. Is this just a spam call from them? Is this an actual number that truist will call from?
