Hello! I've recently enrolled in the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science program at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, and am now looking for accommodation. Unfortuantely, this is turning out to be a far more daunting task than I originally anticipated. All the posts on wg-gesucht ask for a credit report, either a SCHUFA or itsmydata. As far as I can tell, you can only get a SCHUFA report if you've already lived in Germany and have a German bank account. I still reside in the United States and won't even arrive in Germany for another week. Itsmydata, while international, doesn't seem to yet provide service to US residents. In addition, I'm an older student (40) whereas a lot of student accommodations seem to ask for people strictly in their 20s. I'm not wealthy. I cannot afford 1000+ euro/month rent. I'm hoping for a flatshare around 600 euros/month at the very most. I have a hotel reserved until Oct 3, after which I had hoped to have found at least a semi-permanent accommodation but that seems to be less and less likely now. Am I facing an impossible task? Is the living situation so bad that international students have to sometimes forego their university admissions simply because there is nowhere for them to live?
