This is absolutely frustating, i dont know what they want me to answer ! First pre-recorded interview they said its technical issue, but there was none. second Interview, they said i am reading pre-prepared responses which is bs. I have done my thorough research and even prepared for face to face call. I dont look anywhere other than the camera, except when i need to stop recording the answer before the time limit. For that i have too look at screen and click on the button, do they count this as cheatingg ? im very frustated that this is happening, pls help
