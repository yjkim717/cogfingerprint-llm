a while back i had textbook kidney stone symptoms. back pain right at my kidney area and lower stomach pain along with peeing often. it was the weirdest pain i’ve had sort of like extremely bad period cramps, but still different (i was far from my period so that wasn’t the cause). i eventually went to urgent care. they tested my urine and found blood in it (wasn’t visibly bloody), ruled out other causes, said they were pretty certain it was a kidney stone but couldn’t be 100% without imaging, gave me an NSAID injection and told me to go to the ER if it becomes extremely painful again or anything gets worse. the pain stopped after the injection. i drank a lot of lemon water and got this stone breaker supplement thing from a health store. i’m not convinced that it’s even possible that it could’ve been broken up enough to be basically disintegrated, but thought the $10 was worth it even if it just broke into two smaller stones. I never had pain again but also never saw it pass. I was watching for it for a few weeks after. Could it still be up there? It’s been a year. Is it possible that I passed it or unlikely?
