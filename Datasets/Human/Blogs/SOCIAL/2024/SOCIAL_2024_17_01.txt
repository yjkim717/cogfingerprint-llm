I’ve been a nurse for a year and a half. My background is in adult ICU. I always had an interest in NICU, so I applied for the NICU at the children’s hospital in my state. I was so excited about the opportunity to work at a level 4 NICU. I thought I’d see so much and really thought I’d love it. I HATE my new job. I cry before work frequently. I’ve had a different preceptor almost every shift; the unit is extremely cliquey; we are all so micromanaged and everyone is miserable. To make things worse, they just officially announced that they’re splitting the unit into pods. Each pod will only take a specific type of patient. I will be assigned to a pod (since I’m a new hire I’m not allowed to state a preference) and will only take patients in that pod for at least a year. I work every other weekend and rotating shifts. The attendance policy is extremely strict (we can only call out for 4 single shifts a year). I thought the schedule would be worth it for the opportunity to work with so many different types of patients. The decision to split the unit was made before I interviewed. Nobody said anything about it. If I had known, I never would’ve taken this job and would’ve transferred to the NICU at my old facility instead. I want to start exploring other opportunities but I’m worried that it’ll make me look bad to leave after only a few months. Is it okay for me to leave?
