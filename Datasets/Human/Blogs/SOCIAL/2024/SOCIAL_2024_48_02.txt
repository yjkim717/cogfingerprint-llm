I was out at the zoo and I was talking with the person I was with about how we both don’t want kids and why. We kinda agreed that the responsibility of caring for person is a lot. Not only do you need to care about their basic needs, but emotional support, fulfillment, education, etc. it’s a full time job that requires immense patience and empathy. Frankly, I think very few people should be ready for a commitment so great. I wondered why so many people still had kids knowing that I have met a lot of pretty conservatively minded people who seem to think their kid “belongs” to them until their kid is 18 years old. Their kid isn’t allowed to have agency, isn’t allowed to have opinions, and is seen as naive and stupid by default In America, they’re trying to pass laws that limit the autonomy of children and allow parents to have even stricter controls on things like homeschooling. I find it especially infuriating with things like LGBT rights for younger people. I’m not LGBT myself but I can’t imagine not being supportive of my child if they were I get the feeling they all want to force their kid into a specific set of values and way of thinking and see their kid as a failure if they don’t adopt their way of thinking. When their child shows a different method of thinking, they will try to squash it by just saying their child is “naive” or doesn’t understand yet Basically, these parents are just viewing their children as property. Something to fulfill themselves, not the other way around. I just find something deeply unsavory about it
