Today all I could get myself to eat was some handfuls of cereal in the morning and some pasta for dinner. I spent over an hour working up the ability to force myself to eat something since I was so hungry. Food is a struggle every day and Iâ€™m getting to be dangerously underweight. Is it fair to say I have one?
