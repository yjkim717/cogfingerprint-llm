I say biting, but they could’ve just as easily been sniffing or chasing each other. Anyway, it was a black-and-white photo and there were definitely two dogs. The book was contemporary, can’t have been released earlier than the seventies. If I had to make a guess I’d say sometime between 1987 or the early 2000s. I wouldn’t rule out the past ten years either though. Pretty sure it was an American book, almost definitely in English at any rate. Since I haven’t read that’s all I can remember.
