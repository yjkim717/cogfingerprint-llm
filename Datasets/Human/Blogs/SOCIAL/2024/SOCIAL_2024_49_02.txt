This is my 3rd playthrough now and its going different (obv) but in grymforge I \- killed all the dreugar \-got nere out of the rubble \-made him give up the absolute \-saved all the gondians I could so far &#x200B; I'm sure Nere will be killed or something when we move to Act 2 but this was interesting.
