So I bought the game when it first came out on the switch and played it a lot so I got it for the PC too because Id be able to play with freinds. I hook up my pro controller using steam and try playing but everything is off. None of the buttons match what it is for the switch. I can re learn them but I'd prefer not to. Does anyone know how to get the same controls on the switch to the PC?
