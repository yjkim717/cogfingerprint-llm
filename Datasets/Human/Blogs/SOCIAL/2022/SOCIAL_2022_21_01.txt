Only posting this here because it got removed on r/cars. Not that I'm trying to buy a car, I love mine (1995 BMW 325i). I test drove a 2018 VW Golf R yesterday (for fun) and I must say it felt so squishy and just... fake. I don't know for sure but it felt like the wheel and pedals were all by wire. The shifting also just felt so numb. Not to mention you can't feel the road in your butt. (The 315 horsepower awd is great though) What new cars still feel like old cars in the right ways?
