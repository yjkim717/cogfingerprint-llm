So Im in my 20s and still live at home but I’m currently Saving up for a house of my own. My coworker got into an accident and can’t come to work and we are the only 2 in our department so my week went from 8 hours, 5 days a week to 10 hours 7 days a week. I haven’t had a day off in over 2 months. My boss told me I could have this Sunday off since it isn’t supposed to be that busy, once I told my dad he said “well good, I hope you don’t have any plans because we need to do some serious work to this yard and it’s going to take an entire day to get everything done”. To be fair I mow the yard every week but he wants to mow, weed eat, trim branches, trim shrubs, pull weeds out of the garden, rake the grass, etc. all I want to do is sleep in and relax, not do shit. I told him I didn’t want to and he started getting an attitude with me. He and my mom are retired and they don’t work at all so I don’t understand why they can’t do it by themselves. And I already know some of y’all are going to come at me saying “well you live there rent free so you should be greatful and help out” I do help out with many things but I’d rather not spend my only day off in months doing outside yard work.
