Yet I need to rant about blizzard and their shady dealings honestly, I bought OW2 today. Read the description and I guess misunderstood the beta access component as apparently access ended 2 weeks ago. Meaning that all I have now is a score of useless items until October 4th, and lost 40$ on something I won't be able to play until then. Apparently the original description had the dates in it, yet they removed it when access ended, which is the shady part to me. Why remove the dates, or why not mention that access is over and you won't be able to play the beta anymore. Meaning all your doing is preordering the game, which isn't made clear in the description at all. With the solution being to google it to know that fact, over it being made clear in their own launcher that access ended. IDK I may of had a lapse in judgement here and been too trusting with blizzard given their recent actions and dealings. Pretty much anything I buy from them now I will be going through a fine toothed comb given I simply don't trust them anymore not to be shady.
