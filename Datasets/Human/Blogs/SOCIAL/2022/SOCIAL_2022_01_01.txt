Football is all about getting people together. I don’t get why some countries have a Nike branded decal and some don’t. It feels a bit unfair to other countries. Who chose which countries and why? I’m from England and I don’t see why our decal has a Nike logo and other branding on it. Everyone’s decals should either be a flag decal or branded. The flag decals are fire too. I’m jelly. Where is the England flag decal? An England flag would be a really good decal in red and white. I just don’t understand. Maybe someone can explain it. Also on a side note I’m just here waiting on a Team GB Union flag decal with a Mini coooer tie-in. Would be so easy and popular/£££! Union flag Fennec FTW!
