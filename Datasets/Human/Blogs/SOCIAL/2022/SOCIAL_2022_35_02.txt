I (22f) had a friend with BPD (24f) who I stopped talking to a few months back. She had gone off her meds and had been telling me about how much she was struggling mental health wise and trying to guilt me into spending more time with her. It climaxed with her slitting her wrists, nearly bleeding out, and sending me pictures of her bleeding out. She lives an hour away from me, I was at work, and I did not have her current address, so all I could do was tell her to put pressure on it and call 911 to help. Someone else called 911 and they saved her. She would have died without help and had planned on her friends rushing out to play hero and finding her gone. After this the hospital put her on new meds, but we agreed to temporarily stop talking as it was too much for me and I needed time to process what happened. As of recent She has reached out to apologize and let me know she is still on meds and doing much better. She is a great person while on meds. I do miss the person she is while getting help. That being said I have anxiety and depression and that whole event was extremely stressful for me. I am terrified of her doing that again and any trust I had in her is gone. We never took eachother off social media, and as of late she has also been posting extremely rude things about religion (specifically mine) and calling publically out anyone of my belief for being horrible brainwashed people incapable of being friends to anyone and starting fights with people who post any positive things about religion. I honestly don't care what my friends believe, but am also afraid of being attacked for my beliefs as well. I miss her, and just ignoring her feels wrong, but I have no idea how to go about talking to her.
