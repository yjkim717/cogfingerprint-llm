I'm moving to South Carolina in March and I'm wondering which internet provider is best for Fiber Optic in South Carolina. I play video games online and I want the best connection possible and I'd like the best connection possible so I can play with people here in the US just fine as well as play with people overseas (Europe/Asia). For anyone wondering I play PS2 games online using PCSX2 Netplay with ZeroTier and would love to play Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3 online with some of my friends in Europe. Any help is appreciated and I don't know which town I'll be moving to yet because my parents are in charge of that.
