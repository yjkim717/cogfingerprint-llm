I often hear the statement repeated that "no actor is a box office draw", with many people following it up with "except The Rock, DiCaprio and Tom Cruise." I disagree with this statement, and want to break down why. Even though an actor cannot GUARANTEE the success of a movie, that does not mean an actor cannot elevate the success of a movie. For example, many people argue that Hugh Jackman is not a box office draw, and while I agree that he cannot SECURE a movie's success, it is hard to deny that The Greatest Showman would've made 439 million without him. Or let's look at a movie like La La Land - which stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone - and grossed 440 million. Though I would not ENTIRELY credit the success of the movie to them, I would say it helps in large part. Let's look at a movie like Dune, which grossed 400 million. Would it have grossed the same without Zendaya and Timothee? Would a movie like The Lost City have grossed $181 million without Bullock and Tatum? Which brings me to my next point: if actors names were meaningless and IP was everything, don't you think studios would hire no name actors and newcomers for every film? Wouldn't it be simply cheaper that way? Why would Zendaya get paid 10 million to be in the upcoming Challengers if a newcomer would merely ask for $50,000? What would be the point of hiring Chris Hemsworth in ANYTHING if he makes barely any box office difference? What are your thoughts?
