The storms last night destroyed one of my carpenter bee traps and now I gotta find another one. I don’t like trapping them because carpenter bees won’t sting and they’re kinda dopey because they like to fly head first into everything in their way, but they’ve done a number on my porch and no matter how I’ve treated the wood, they always find a way to bore around it.
