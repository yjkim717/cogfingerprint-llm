Looking for any input from people in the branding field or business owners (or anyone with opinions/advice honestly). I would like to work freelance for local companies to help with overall branding. Ideally my roles would be logo, web, advertising, and signage design along with interior decorating and social media advising. I see so many local businesses dying even though they have so much potential. Outdated interiors, logos, ads, and little social media presence are the main things holding them back. I would love to be able to give these companies an overall facelift to appeal to millennials/gen z and make their shop/restaurant a full experience rather than just a business. I am much better at design than the business side of things, but I know that I would have to do some marketing work to appeal to target audiences. I imagine that I would work with a company on a contract for a few months, get them all of their design materials with some future editing options, decorate the interior of the shop, advise them on social media presence/give them materials to post, and then stay in contact for any future advertising needs. If you’re in the branding field, I would love to know any feedback on if this is realistic/advice on what steps to take. If you’re a business owner I would love to know if this is something that you would be interested in so that I can gage the potential.
