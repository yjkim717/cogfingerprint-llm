Ill spare you my own life's monologue, but I always say the world is against me, and people always tell me no that's not the case your being negative. But negative things happen to me on a daily basis regardless of trying to do right or be good. Nothing seems to matter in the end and its exhausting. Ironically the people who usually say this to me are people who are happily enjoying a good life or have good luck. View Poll
