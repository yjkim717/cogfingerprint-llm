I was kind of curious if anyone has ever tried indexing a large number of companies filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy while their stocks were selling for pennies? And if so, what were the results? If a few of those companies managed to either turn things around or were acquired by more successful entities could that potentially make up for loses? I was looking at a bankrupt company's stock price earlier, and realized I could literally buy more than 100 shares for $10, despite the fact that the company is still operating and at least one large subsidiary is still profitable, so part of my brain is telling me to get a list of companies in Chapter 11 and start buying.
