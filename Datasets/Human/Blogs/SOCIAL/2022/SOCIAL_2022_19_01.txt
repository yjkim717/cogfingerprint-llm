Thank you so much for being generous with newcomers ! This is one of very few communities on reddit that doesnt mock newcomers for their lack of knowledge. I have learnt so much about fragrance world. Its impossible to even think that was so much depth to a frag. 3 years ago i held the view that spending more than rs.500 ($6) on frag is waste as its all the same. I discovered jeremy fragrance channel and immediately headed towards searching for frag world on reddit. Got my Invictus Aqua, Bvlgari Aqua Marine and Versace Eros in the same month. After talking to people here, learnt a lot of different notes and whether you'll like them or not. I didnt even know the concept of 2ml decants. I used to blind buy most of the frags. Thanks to you guys im now a better consumer than ever. After getting lured by instagram sellers for unbelievably low prices, i fell for it and got refills/fakes. Out of them only 1 good and genuine seller was discovered, that too only because he had a physical store near me. This community also encouraged me to join fragrance groups on fb and im having a blast over there ! So much generosity. People handing out decants for newcomers, selling caps and empty bottles for free ! All of them are genuine sellers owning a boutique or themselves being authorized resellers. Of course prices arent as low as instagram sellers, but i'd be happy to pay 30-40% less than MRP for genuine product. Thank you all ! and keep up the good work !
