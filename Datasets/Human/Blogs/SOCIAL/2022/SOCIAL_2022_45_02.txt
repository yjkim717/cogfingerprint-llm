Many polling locations still use paper ballots where you have to fully fill in a rectangle or oval using a pen. Neither the poll workers nor the machine that reads your ballot care what pen you use, so itâ€™s much easier and certain to use a marker instead of the provided ball-point pen. Source: I have worked more than a dozen elections for multiple local and state governments. Edit: Someone mentioned that their ballot specifically said not to use a marker. That's true in some polling places. If you get there and your ballot says that, then definitely don't use the marker. But most ballots allow it.
