Happy Holidays all! I bought this several months ago hoping to use it but turns out I didn't need it for my build after all. It is still sealed in the box never opened! Asking $800 OBO...also willing to meet between St. Louis and Springfield if local. This card was $1,500 when i bought it. Hoping to make someones Christmas!
