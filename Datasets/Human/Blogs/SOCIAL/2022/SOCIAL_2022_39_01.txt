So we've had an ro filter for quite a while in our basement everything's working fine with it but I'd like something explained. The RO unit comes with a storage for the water (about 5 gallons). I was wondering if I run it past what the storage has would I still be getting the same TDS water or would it run through the filter too quickly? So far I've just been emptying out the 5 gallons every day to have water to mix in a week time but if I could just have it on for like an hour or two with no reprocussions that'd be amazing. Let me know and thank y'all in advance Should also mention the RO unit comes from Hague
