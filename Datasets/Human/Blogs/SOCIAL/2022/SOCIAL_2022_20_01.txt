Edit: might have been a web series or something similar? Not even sure if I am just imagining this show, but I might have seen part of it on Youtube or live TV in the mid to late 2000s (possibly in the early 2010s as well). I think it had a theme song similar to the Inbetweeners theme song and a visually similar intro (2000s indie style, maybe). I think it used the U.S. The Office font in the intro with character names and cutout pictures of each character introducing them one by one, with a pale yellow background. It might have taken place in an office/workplace, not sure. (Definitely not The Office U.S. or British version.) Probably no laugh track. The characters were probably mostly adults in their 20s-30s. It might have been British, otherwise an American or Canadian show. It had an early 2000s funny and cringey Inbetweeners/Peep Show vibe, but in a more adult-oriented way, like Parks and Rec if had taken place 10 years earlier and was more sarcastic and subdued in tone (which is why I am inclined to believe the show might have been British). It's not IT Crowd, Peep Show, Arrested Development, Community, The Office (US or UK), Spaced, Workaholics, Flight of the Conchords, Black Books, Extras, or Parks and Rec. I've seen most of the big popular American sitcoms, which leads me to think this show is a more niche show or British/Canadian (since I'm American and am mostly exposed to American shows). Any suggestions are appreciated. Sorry if I am imagining this show, but I swear I've seen the TV intro I described, or at least something similar.
