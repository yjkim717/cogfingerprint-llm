First off let me just say I just awoke from by far the scariest nightmare I've ever had, I legit woke up crying, screaming, & with a heart-rate of 132. A little background on this I was a very troubled child in terms of anger issues, my dad was usually away & now lives in South Carolina, & my mom has really bad MS to the point she can't walk. The nightmare started with a normal scenario in a city nearby at some random non-chain restaurant with my mom & grandmother (I live with irl). I threw some type of temper tantrum over the food or some stupid shit (I don't completely remember) & then was kicked out inciting that I was just like my wretched dad & to never return. Kicked out of the restaurant I cried stumbling down the street to a line of stares from business owners through the buildings windows & people turning over closesigns looking at me. And then I fell hard to the pavement & blacked out After waking back up later that night at home my grandmother & mom revealed the awful truth to me. Before "my parents met" my dad used to be an insanely corrupt politician holding the state hostage like a mafia committing many crimes keeping our states capital city in check. They explained my mom was a government infiltrated spy sent to have a child with my dad to somehow stop him via media scandals. Point is my dad found out the plan caught my mother broke her legs & raped her producing me however many months later. My dad was still in power after I was born however thanks to that scandal he had to lay low so he started a fake life keeping our family basically hostage. This is where things got too real for me, real life factual strange coincidences started adding up: The fact that despite our family being insanely poor my dad could afford expensive things like those giant TVs, a Wii on Release date, & miniature aquarium in our house. The fact that many times as a child I'd see my dad with really important (big wig) people. The 10 + occasions me & my dad were almost killed by people. The fact that despite MS being insanely common I'd never seen anybody who literally couldn't walk & that she only couldn't walk right after I was born. The fact that my dad without warning left our home state & didn't contact anyone fir 4 years with no trace to speak of. There were a ton of other little moments that flashed by too like secret non-descript propaganda related media irl (TV shows & movies that related to my dad's corruption). And one that still freaks me out is the connection between a few unnatural fears/ talents I have irl & the storyline; for example I hate the sound of my mother crying it actually makes me angry & I am insanely good at debating spinning stories & such. End point being that a lotta people wanted my dad dead & some could want me dead, but I had the responsibility of reforming a change in my home state by clearing my name becoming the next politician in power. Basically my whole life was a fabricated plan to overturn the political regime my father caused & despite the fear I had no choice but to step up to the plate & incite a change in my connotation to the public of my home state. Yeah it probably doesn't sound that nightmarish in text but visually & narratively woven this dream was waaaaaaaay too real for me & despite being unorthodox is by far the most freaky, terrifying, & realistic nightmare I've ever had to date.
