I'm studying Vietnamese at the moment and I have to say it's a very fun language. The way they describe things and the effects of many years of isolation/Chinese/French rule had on the language are fascinating. And there's more Vietnamese speakers than Italian speakers (although internationally there is probably more Italian, there are just a lot of people in Vietnam lol). One thing I like is their adaptation of the romance alphabet to comply with six tones and twelve vowels, but it's kind of misleading because while they use the same characters, a lot of the use of the character's pronunciation is completely different. The north's consonants are actually very similar to western language as well, while the south is much softer and fluid. Once you get past pronunciation the grammar is very easy and the vocabulary isn't as expressive as other languages, but its similar to how Japanese words sound like what they are trying to describe rather than some cultural abstraction. . That's all!
