My brother is dealing with an ebay transaction. According to him, ebay gave him an (805) number that deals with this, and so they told him to transfer $5,000 into my account. They then called me, and were about to walk me through opening up an account to where I can transfer this money too. Guy had a very thick Indian accent, and it sounded really sketchy to me. So I hung up. They been spamming my phone trying to get back in touch. I called my brother back, he says ebay gave him this number. But I have never heard of anything like this. I now have $5,000 of my brothers money in my Venmo account, and not sure what to do. Do I listen to the instructions from "Ebay" and do what they ask? Or do I send this money back to my bro?
