So my wife and I were laying in bed last night and we have a hallway with full mirrors on both sides and a window that shines the sun thru a small opening in our bathroom....down off of one of the mirrors refracting down and to a small spot on the wall. Then we got into the debate of what if it was 30 feet long full of the exact mirror setup bouncing all the way down, would it still be just as bright? What about 100 feet? If the mirrors were perfect and no light was lost on the angle....does light get lost the more you refract it? Thanks ahead of time!
