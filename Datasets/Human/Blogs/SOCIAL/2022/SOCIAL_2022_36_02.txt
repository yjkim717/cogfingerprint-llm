My niece is turning 7 in a few days, and I wanted to gauge people's opinions on getting her the Circle of Magic series for her birthday. She is an avid reader, and currently loves the American Girl books (Kaya is her favorite), Magic Tree House and the Wizard of Oz books. If you think I should wait, what books do you think I should get her instead? Edit: I've read everything Tamora Pierce has written, I'm just not super familiar with kids and age-appropriate things. The Alanna books will definitely wait til she's 10 or 11 and only after a conversation with her parents to check in with them
