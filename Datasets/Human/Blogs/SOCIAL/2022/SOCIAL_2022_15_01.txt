So my kitty got spayed on February 1 (she is 5 months old). Her original incision was glued shut (I think; I didn’t see any visible stitches). She was an active kitty and unfortunately that activity led to her opening the incision on February 6 in the evening. I got her all taken care of, but she now has actual stitches. She has been wearing the cone since I got her back and has been in a small room in an attempt to keep her from running around. The discharge instructions say that her stitches need to be removed 10-14 days later. And since I am a worried cat parent, I have been doing research about the earliest time I can remove the stitches, but I am not getting a clear answer. Do I have to bring her into the vet after 10 days and let them decide if she’s healed enough? Do I let her continue wearing the cone for the two weeks and keeping her in the small room? And before you ask, I would have posted a picture of her incision, but this post won’t let me for some reason. I will try to find a way if the need is great enough. EDIT: incision pic:
