What if we could make paint and tattoos for our CaW(s) the same way we make texture mods for characters in video games? Even if it's just drawing on them in Creation Suite the same way you apply hair dye. I, personally, would love this. I always wanna make a bunch of different face paint designs for my CaW but never have a way to figure out how to translate an image file on my PC to what it would look like on a CaW's face. If there's a program/app that does this please let me know. I hope that some of y'all like this idea of mine
