I’m in nursing school. Yesterday, I had a clinical rotation with a school nurse. In the morning, a kid came in and said she had been tu*. The nurse asked me to take her temperature, so I handed the kid a thermometer. Our fingertips brushed. I immediately used hand sanitizer and washed my hands as soon as I was able to (about 20 minutes later). I made sure not to touch my face before I could wash them, and didn’t eat until after they had been washed with hot water and soap. It’s been 31 hours since this. I know I’m likely being unreasonable, but I’m really anxious about it. Am I probably ok?
