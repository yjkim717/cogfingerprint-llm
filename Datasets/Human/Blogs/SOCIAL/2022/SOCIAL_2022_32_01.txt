I guess I had some issues that started at some point in childhood. The reason being that id refuse to wear 2 piece swimsuits because I was extremely conscious of my stomach…before I even became overweight. It had gotten worse when I had gained and became roughly 50 pounds overweight and had a group of people that had been outright harassing me about every aspect of how I looked. The weight was lost….but I ended up going down to 90 pounds because…. at some point the weight loss went unhealthy. I got into walking around the house for a lot of my waking hours and to eat severely less portions. Thought that it would help get rid of this leftover stomach that is most likely extra skin. I gained back to a healthy weight…but am still having issues with my body in terms of my stomach, how I look in general. I just become severely body conscious whenever the person I’m with wants to try to start anything. I’m tired of it and just want to be comfortable my own skin. Not worrying about how weight loss impacted my chest and stomach and how they still look. Or how I just sound like a child or anything.
