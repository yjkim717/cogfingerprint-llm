I'm 21 years old and I graduate from college this December. I've accepted a job in Denver, 1500 miles away from home. I was so excited when I initially made the decision; but now, I'm terrified. I haven't been able to eat or sleep because I'm so worried. I don't move until February, but it feels like I'm out of time at home with my parents and friends. I also recently rekindled things with a guy I've been dating for almost a year, and I'm scared of how the move will change things. I don't know if we can handle long distance, or where he'll end up after he graduates in May. I don't want to lose him, and I feel like I'm choosing between him and the move. I've been unhappy in my hometown for years. This is something I've worked for and wanted for a very long time. But instead of feeling happy, excited, or successful, I feel so alone. Is this normal nerves, or is this intuition that I'm making the wrong decision? How do I tell? Can you guys tell me moving success stories? I can't even describe how afraid I am.
