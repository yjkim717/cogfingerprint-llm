I'm so freaking tired of life right now. (Don't worry I'm not suicidal) I was living pretty much paycheck to paycheck, my wife and I had a few thousand saved up, but <5k. I was then diagnosed with malignant melanoma this past year and now almost all savings are gone, my HSA is decimated, I make too much to qualify for the financial aid programs available, but not enough to continue paying off everything. The stress of the disease, the money, and work are just debilitating to be honest. Also, just in case you were curious, my insurance has been billed over 700k for cancer treatments this year. I am thankful I have insurance and it has capped my out of pocket max for the year at 7k, but I'm going broke paying it.
