Hey, 17F here, GMT. I tend to reply quickly, and I’m fairly literate, but I’m not too picky, just put in a little effort into your replies. I love fantasy but giants are probably one of my favorite creatures/concepts. Looking for someone who would want to be a giant in a fantasy story, either urban fantasy or medieval. I love angst and conflict so terror and distrust is a big theme, including many escape attempts. I don’t like when the giant is cruel or malicious, but a little teasing and scaring them is good. Other than that I’m pretty flexible! Whether you’re an ancient being that a human stumbled across or a tiny fairy that you captured in a mason jar, I’m probably down to do it. I prefer Reddit chat but Discord works too. DM me! (Oh, and as long as this post is still up, my offer is still active!)
