This is my first time growing my hair out. I’ve noticed the longer it’s gotten, the more it’s lightened. It used to be a fairly dark auburn color with a couple of blond ish highlights, now it’s kinda a light reddish-brown. People have even pointed it out, as well, saying it looks noticeably lighter than on my ID and in pictures. I didn’t do anything to it I really don’t like how it’s lightening. Is there a way to prevent further lightening without dying it?
