My crown vic is not starting. It is turning but not starting. The odometer is also not showing any numbers, but lights up with dashes. Turning seems slow as well. Any ideas what may be causing it? Car has 301k km on it if that helps. Battery is less than a year old, entire cooling system has been replaced recently. Alternator is at least 6 years old and spark plugs are about 5 years old.
