My wife is a real estate agent and recently was hired to find a house for a Cambodian couple that own a donut shop. They just financed a new Toyota about 9 months ago but this is messing up their credit and the car would need to be paid off in order to clear off enough debt to buy a home.Being from another country they aren't big on banks, but they are also smart enough to know that need one and they are getting an education in dealing with the American financial system.My wife has been working with them for over a year making sure they have the proper tax docs and pointing them in the direction of a good mortgage company, they sound like nice folks.The question is, how can they pay off that Toyota without depositing the cash in a bank?I'm assuming the IRS doesn't know about the cash and that's why they are avoiding it.I know that if you pay cash the day you get the car you can just pay the full amount and walk out, but what do you do if you financed it? Edit: I forgot to mention the payoff amount is 29K
