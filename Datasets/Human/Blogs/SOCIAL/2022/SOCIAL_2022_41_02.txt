I just took a test and according to the results i am either a soft classic, a theatrical romantic or a soft gamine but I just dont understand how to interpret the results For reference in the body skeleton section i am ECAD, in the body flesh section i am EDEDD, and in the facial features section I am CCACEC according to this test. Is there a particularly definitive, must have trait for each of these that can help me determine which one i am? Id appreciate any advice!
