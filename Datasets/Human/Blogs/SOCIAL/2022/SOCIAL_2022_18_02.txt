Has anyone had this happen? I bought a graphics card off offer up and the person sent a shipping label. With a valid tracking number. As well as his name and address, but the tracking info has never updated. Like it says it’s on it way to a usps facility for about 4 days. I can’t figure out if it’s legit or not. I’m so confused
