I just start laughing and try to tell her how crazy it is she is just giving me that and she didn't understand my broken Vietnamese and just told me to take it 30 minutes before bed and don't take two within 6 hours etc. Man I'm fkn zooted right now. I don't really do hard drugs anymore, but this is making me nostalgic for what used to be. eyyyyy
