I started using heavy duty traps. That worked for a little bit, but now they seem to have learned to avoid them. Rat poison seems to be my only option, but having the rats die, and decompose in my walls is not an experience I wasn't to go through. Are they ways to get rid of them that I'm nit thinking of?
