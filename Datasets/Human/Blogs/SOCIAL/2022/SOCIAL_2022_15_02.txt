Alright, I know I’m late to the party for this, but with todays update, I really want to start earning the new rewards. Is the Wilderness “safe”? I know about the threat system and all of the new mobs and that good stuff. But my question pertains PKers and PVP. As long as I absolutely make sure I opt out of PKing before entering, is there anyway for someone else to force me to opt in (apart from cursed energy trading). Additionally, does death work in the same way in the wilderness (as long as I am opted out of pvp)? If I die, does everything drop to the ground, or can I pay death to reclaim it? I have had too many bad experiences in the past to the point where I just avoided it altogether. With this new update, I want to try it, but it’s still terrifying.
