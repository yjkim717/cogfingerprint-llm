I am a PR in Canada but a US Citizen and I might be offered a remote job in the US and just use my SSN and get my paychecks deposited to an account as a US bank as well. I already have to file US taxes every year so I would just continue that but I believe if dont earn any CAD income I wont have to file. What would be the correct route?
