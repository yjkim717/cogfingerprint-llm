TLDR; ENT "doctor" is useless, but I think my dad needs to see a professional for help. My dad has tinnitus and possibly other hearing problems. He has trouble hearing certain frequencies, and it is imbalanced between the ears so everything sounds unbalanced to him. He also says that one of his ears feels blocked. He went to an ENT doctor, but the guy basically said "nothing's wrong", told my dad he didn't have enough earwax to clean his ears (bullshit, just a lazy doctor), shooed him out the door, and made an easy $250+. This seems to be common based on other posts. So how the fuck do I get real help for my dad's ears? (Sorry if this is the wrong sub but r/hearing is dead)
