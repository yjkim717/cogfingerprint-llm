I'll go first. 1. You should change the angle stop valves and supply lines to your toilets and sinks if they are over a decade old. Why? The rubber o rings in angle stop rot out after 10 years. You won't notice a problem until you need to cut the water to make a sink or toilet repair and you're left with a pesky drip. Supply lines are under constant pressure and over 10-20 years begin to break down, eventually, they start to leak. 2. You should replace your washing machines supply lines and cut off valves if they are over 10 years old. Why? Same reason as above, stuff fails as it gets older. 3. You should consider upgrading your electrical panel if it's over 20 years old. Why? There is nothing worse than an old rusty exterior electric panel, breakers tend to start failing around this age as well. A new panel looks good and beefs up the safety of your home's electrical systems, plus today's homes draw more power, probably a lot more power than the panel you have from 1982 bolted to your wall. It's not cheap, but it's something you can plan for. There are tons more, but those are the ones I think go under the radar.
