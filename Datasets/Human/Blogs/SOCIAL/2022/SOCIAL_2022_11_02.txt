I hate Metlife right now... I was recently diagnosed with melanoma and really don't feel like dealing with this crap. I filed my STD claim since I had surgery for 2 weeks to recover, apparently, my surgery only gets 1 week off disability. Then when I asked about radiation and follow up appointments, I was told it's not covered.... I'm still pretty sure it is, so I'll be submitting a new claim, but still, it's pissing me off. On top of this, my doctor happens to be out of the office this past week, and apparently they're closing my claim because they can't get the medical info from them.
