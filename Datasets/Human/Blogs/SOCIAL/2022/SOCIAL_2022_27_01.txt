I started working here almost a year ago coming from FedEx. I chose this job because I am determined to buy a house some day and I hear this is a career that pays really well. At the moment I'm a cover driver and package handling working my way to be 22.4 or Full-time (hoping they remove 22.4 position in the next contract.) I've already qualified but Ive also already broken 2 mirrors in a span of 2 months because of vines I didn't see grabbed my mirrors and broke them against the truck. I'm worried that I'll get suspended and have my seniority reset... I'm also working another Job on Sundays and whenever I'm told to just stay home I work my second job. I'm hoping I start getting steady hours here soon but only time will tell when that happens. Ive found that I don't mind the job itself, driving and delivering is fine for what it is. It's all the strict rules and corrupt managent that throws me off, how do you guys do it?
