I find it really discouraging with the push and presence of English. I wanted to learn Finnish and still find it a really fascinating language. But when I would try to speak or use Finnish, I'd just get replied in English. Something happened when trying to learn Hindi. I was spoken to in English and feel really discouraged to continue trying at Hindi. Or Hinglish for that matter. What's the point if imma just be spoken to in English? I've less of an issue with languages like Mandarin, Korean or Japanese for example. More people are willing to speak back in their native language and I can actually practise more. How do I not give up on language with all this? Is this just my experience or has anyone felt this way? How to not feels so discouraged by this fact?
