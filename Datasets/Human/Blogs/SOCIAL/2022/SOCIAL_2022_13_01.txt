I've been sick twice since getting invisalign. Something I miss is drinking tea throughout the day or a Powerade/Gatorade when I'm sick. I know I could still have these with my aligners out, but I feel it would be too much of a hassle as I try to get around 23 hours of wear. I am sure a throat lozenge or hard candy would be an absolute no. Suggestions? If it matters, I only have a tray on the top.
