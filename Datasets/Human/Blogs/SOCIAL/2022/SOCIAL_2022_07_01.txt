im rewatching this season atm and just watched the challenge in this episode. they have to cook for a high school reunion and the committee is interviewed by 2 chefs for the menu. paul did an amazing job at listening and directing, but what the *fuck* is up with elizabeth? she got everything entirely wrong, and is so oblivious to it in her confessionals and in the kitchen while cleaning up. all that bleach really did fry her brain cells
