Hi all, I want to hear from people who have switched providers. I could technically be done with treatment, but I am not happy with the results and I am moving in about 6 weeks. My main concerns are 1 small black triangle/gap and 1 that developed with invisalign recently. I don't really want to go the bonding route, but I also don't want to pay a ton extra to switch providers. If I just finish now, I will get retainers. How much did it cost you to switch providers compared to your original payment? Did your plan stay the same? Did you still need bonding? If you did not switch providers but were not satisfied with your end result, did you get a refund? If so, how?
