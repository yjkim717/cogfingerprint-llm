I have an 11 month old cat and she came out of heat a few days ago after being in it for 2 weeks. she cant get outside and always stays in the house. when she was in heat she was very vocal which is normal for her but when shes not in heat she is very quiet. a week after and shes started constantly meowing and howling, shes eating plenty, her poop was a bit liquid earlier but nothing alarming. she also jumps up to the arm of my chair nipping at my elbow, she is only quiet if i pet or play with her but she normally runs off after a minute so i dont think its boredom or wanting attention. im just stumped, i dont think shes hurt herself, nothing seems off physically and shes still running around everywhere and jumping everywhere
