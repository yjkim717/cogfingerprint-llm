So I’m a 5’9 male in my 20s and I weigh 160lbs which isn’t bad but I have a double chin and my belly pokes out a lot and I don’t understand. No one believes me when I tell them my weight and I get called things like “big boy, fat boy, etc. (not making fun of me but just calling me that to address me). My younger brother is 5’8 and weighs 150lbs and he looks as super skinny, especially compared to me. No double chin, he even has abs even though he told me he doesn’t work out or diet. Did I just get born with shitty genes or something ? Im very self conscious about my looks. It’s gotten so bad I hate when people take pictures of me because I don’t wanna see my double chin. What’s also wierd is my ribs stick out and I can see my rib cage when I lift my shirt. Maybe im just big boned ? Idk. I just wanted to get it off my chest because it’s been bothering me not talking about it with anyone
