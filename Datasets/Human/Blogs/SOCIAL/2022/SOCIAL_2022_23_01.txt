The thing I’ve noticed (esp in most of the posts here) is that the real problem with GQ is that (to me) it’s trying to be both a reboot and a new show. I think the reason why And Just Like That has been a somewhat successful reboot is that it focuses exclusively on the og characters. BUT GQ has tried to introduce new characters with loose connections to the og cast. I think GQ would’ve been better if it had just chosen from the start to either focus solely on new stories OR be a continuation of the original series. The writers having to balance everyone’s stories makes everything feel disconnected, which is only emphasized by the new characters being in a totally separate age group. I know people are thinking this season is setting up to have all the og cast exit but if it gets another season I think that’ll just ruin viewership for the show. Really curious to see where we go from here.
