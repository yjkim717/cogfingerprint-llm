There’s a jingle that you can hear in the garbled static at the end of the song that I know for a fact is a pre-existing tune. I’ve heard it before in other places, like, for instance, a scene in A Serious Man where Michael Stuhlbarg’s character is fixing an aerial and it plays at the end there as well. I’m almost positive it’s a TV jingle and given how often it seems to be used in things that are totally unrelated to each other, that makes me think I probably do know the name or origin of it and just can’t put the two together.
