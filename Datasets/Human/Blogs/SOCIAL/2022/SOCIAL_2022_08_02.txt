I am very panicked right now, my cat Bubba, keeps dry heaving, but nothing's coming out, I don't know what this means, he's never had hairballs before, I need to get to work, but my first priority is Bubba, so I need to figure out what's going on so I can help him or if I can have someone else watch him while I'm gone
