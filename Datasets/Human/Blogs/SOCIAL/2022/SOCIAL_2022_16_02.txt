I post on a game forum from time to time, along with reading posts to pass the time. Yet it never ceases to amaze me how everyone is an expert, even though they haven't played said class or specialization. Along with even when presented with backed facts, find a way to always be "right", when their clearly wrong. In which it's hard to discern whether their trolling or not, and makes me simply end the arguments by not responding anymore, which defeats the purpose of an argument. I wish people would take a step back, actually given responses some thought over being "lul, your wrong and I'm right cause I'm a god at this game who knows everything, and you know nothing."
