I can’t even remember how I first found this, but I recall the general idea and a blurb about how it may have been an inspiration for Nicholas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now and Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, both of which came out in the early seventies, and I seriously doubt it would’ve come out in earlier than 1966, so that would be the cutoff. I also remember the poster having a very distinct palette of red, white, and black. I think it might’ve have a one-word title, but I could easily be wrong about that. Pretty sure it was British and debuted at a film festival.
