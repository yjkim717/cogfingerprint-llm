Spoiler: I am reading the new book my Rick Riordan. This is the man who wrote the Percy Jackson series. The main character is a 14 year old girl. She is the defacto leader of the team and Captain of the ship. And she has her period. She has her box of maxi pads and bottle of Middle and a heating pad for her cramps. There are no jokes. There are no boys saying, Maybe you're too hormonal to lead. Maybe a man should step up and take charge. She is allowed to be a leader and a woman. I have read romance novels written by women that complete glossed over that fact of life. This is just one of the reasons why I think Rick Riordan is one of the greatest writers I have ever read.
