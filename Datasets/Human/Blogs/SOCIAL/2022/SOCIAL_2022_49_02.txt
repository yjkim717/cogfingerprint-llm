I decided to start my "Kill as Many Sims in the World as Possible before you die" Campaign using the extreme violence mod and enabled autonomous killing for active household.. This would involve going house to house in each neighborhood starting in Willow Creek. I made it through most of the neighborhood just fine until freaking PANCAKES. Not only did multiple attempts to kill her get thwarted, she had the AUDACITY to kick me while reading and walking away only to turn back towards me and stab me to death. I will now start a revenge mission and torture her.
