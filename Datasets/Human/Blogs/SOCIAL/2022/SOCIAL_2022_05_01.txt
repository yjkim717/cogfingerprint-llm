I work from home, so most of my communication is done via email. When our manager sends us anything of relevance that we need to incorporate into our procedures, *everyone* in the department replies-all "Got it!" or some variation of that within a 2 hour window. Since every other department I work with emails me, or if anything I need to get done ASAP is also emailed to me, having 10 notifications of "Sounds good" drives me up the wall. This has been going on for over a year, and my manager hasn't said anything. Maybe I am being dramatic, but would it look bad on me to politely ask everyone to reply their acknowledgements to our manager only?
