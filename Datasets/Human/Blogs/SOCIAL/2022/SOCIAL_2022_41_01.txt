He's in his late thirties I think, and I know he keeps in touch occasionally with a few of my other classmates as well, but I showed some of them our text exchanges and they said it was weird. He's pretty much always the first to text and keeps telling me we should hang out and I should offer him coffee or a beer. Idk, maybe i'm just reading too much into it but tbh it feels weird since he was my teacher until like 5 months ago. It feels even weirder because he knows some private details about a "relationship" i had during school...it makes me uncomfortable but idk if its just me. I also dont know if I can just stop replying altogether, thinking about the things he knows about me makes me feel weird and I would much rather not have to think about all that every time a notification pops up on my screen
