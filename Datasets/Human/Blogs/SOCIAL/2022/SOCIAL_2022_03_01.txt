We saw the Veranda Santa episode of Bluey and I've been playing it with our 5 and 2yo leading up the Christmas. My 5-year-old waking up today and yelling "A PIECE OF GARLIC!" and the satisfying thud of (what was actually an onion) hitting his wall had us in stitches. Best 6:00 a.m. wake up I ever got. And the two year old was quite happy with her potato. Bluey ftw again.
