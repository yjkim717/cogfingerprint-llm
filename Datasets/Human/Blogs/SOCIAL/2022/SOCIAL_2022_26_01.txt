I’ve been asking my psychologist to consider adhd. He has told me that he thinks I am the way I am because of low expectations from my parents, and changed the subject whenever I ask for a formal evaluation. But last week he suggested I see a psychiatrist. For chronic depression not adhd, but I’ll still count this as a win because I researched the guy I’m going to and he has experience with adult adhd. I also called in advance to give him a heads up for the purpose of my appointment and he seemed open to consider it. After so long of begging I can get an evaluation and have him be un biased. I’m not looking to be diagnosed with adhd, I just want it considered as an option. At least I’ll know he’s not being dismissive.
