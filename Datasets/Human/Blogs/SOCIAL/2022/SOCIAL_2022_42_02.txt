My son got a job at Walmart. Yay! But he has to pay $45 to get a physical. Insurance won't pay for it of course. I paid for it and he got the physical then went to his orientation. He had his birth certificate, his social security card, and his ID. His ID expired 2 weeks ago. He is no longer who it says he is. $30 to get it renewed. $75 to get a job. WTF??
