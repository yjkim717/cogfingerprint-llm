So, with the designs of Moondrop and Sundrop being interchangeable, it got me thinking and now I'm mad. All I can think of is that they remind me of that dress from 2015, the gold and white/black and blue dress. I can't get it out of my head and it's all I see, what do you guys think, or have I got you thinking about it too?
