Somewhat just moved to an area a month ago to an area that has wegmans. I was hoping to transfer from my prior Safeway job, but them, nor any Albertsons owned locations are in this state. I applied, and got, a job with a Starbucks down here a few weeks prior to moving. I had an interview with Wegmans Wednesday. Was told they’d get back to me, and my concern and slightly there’s was me having a job. Had told them that I could work around the schedule and see if I could set days for Starbucks and be able to work both. If I had stayed at my old job, I’d have 5 years with them. Would any of that even matter to them given working for Starbucks?
