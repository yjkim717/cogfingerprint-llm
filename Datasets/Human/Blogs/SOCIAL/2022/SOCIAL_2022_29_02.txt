For the longest time I've wanted to start a Let's Play channel. I have all the equipment I need to do it, but I just have no idea how to use it or where to start looking. I don't understand the production aspect of it which is what I get hung up on. I want to learn how to but everything I've read online doesn't connect it sounds like advice from somebody who has no idea what they are actually talking about; it's like they have no actual expirence & only knowledge comes from what they imagine the process to be like. (Legit one excerpt called it "the new easy way" (which is complete BS). At one point I thought a good solution would be college for filmmaking but then I thought about what that course would entail & I doubt that will scratch the learners itch I have for what I'm looking for. Main point I just want something understandably constructive that will give me actual straight forward intuitive advice for what I want to do. I have all the tools I could need yet for nearly 2 years I haven't made a lick of progress, I always get hung up on something super important that no one can answer "what's wrong with". Anybody understand how I feel or have any reference pieces for what might help like step to step guides or actual setup advice from people with expirence from Youtube?
