Artists use photos for photobashing is fine as long as most of the orignal gets covered up and thus unrecognizable. However artists also use sites like these for referencing or learning Arent sites like shotdeck who monetize screenshot from movies NOT protected by fair usage ? Help me understand the legality of it. Under fair usage its not allowed to directly profit off the copyrighted material right ?
