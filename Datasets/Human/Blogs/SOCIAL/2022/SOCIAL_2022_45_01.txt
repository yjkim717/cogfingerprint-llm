I’ve been taking Oz for diabetes and an unrelated serious neurological problem, so the recent shortage is especially scary for me. My doctor had a sample pen on hand, so he gave me that, and then I managed to find a pharmacy that filled my 3-pen prescription. Between the sample and the prescription, that’s 16 injections. It’s three months before my insurance would cover it again, but there’s no way to know if this shortage will be over by then. So I’ve decided to do my injections 8 days apart instead of 7. That way, In 90 days when I’m eligible for a refill, I’ll still have almost 6 weeks to hunt down a pharmacy that has it in stock before I run out, because I’ll gain 4 weeks from the sample pen and 16 days from the “rationing.” Anyone have any alerts or concerns about this plan? Obviously 7 days is ideal and correct, but given the shortage, I’m concerned about it taking weeks to get a refill when insurance won’t let me start trying until the current prescription is about a week from running out. Thoughts?
