Hi finally joined the PC world after being with mac using windows on it for so long I just bought my first PC spec list is AMD Ryzen 5 3600 Mobo B450 pro Graphics card RX 560 Ram Viper eilte 2 4 gig and a 8 gig stick for a total of 12 gigs of ram I know I should go with 16 but for what I play and will be doing 16 is overkill my monitor is an AOC G2 Series C27G2 27 inch VA panel My mouse and keyboard is a G502 and a G pro TKL with blue switches and my headset is some Steel series headset.
