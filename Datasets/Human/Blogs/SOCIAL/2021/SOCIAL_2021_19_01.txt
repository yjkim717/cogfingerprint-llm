Pete Beard is a channel i've been following for a long time now. Its based on illustrators of the past. He glances over their style and history. Since im starting to take illustration seriously, i thought i'd suggest this as i've learnt a great deal about different styles just by watching his channels. I highly recommend watching the video "illustration and advertising". There is so much for us to learn on that channel.
