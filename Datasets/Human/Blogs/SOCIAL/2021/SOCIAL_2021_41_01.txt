I recently found this recipe and I decided to try it out this morning and it is so easy, quick and surprisingly tasty! For about 8 pancakes (each made with a 1/4 cup of batter) you'll need 2 bananas (better if brown), 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of rolled oats, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of salt and sugar. This is the original recipe. Once you've cooked them you just let them cool and you can freeze them in between layers of parchment paper. Whenever you want one just throw it in the microwave for about 30 seconds and you're good to go! In the link, the calories and macros are calculated on a serving size of about 3-4 pancakes, depending on their thickness. Honestly, 2 pancakes would be enough for me on a normal week day. I added all the ingredients to loseit and for a serving size of 2 pancakes it calculated about 107 calories|2,5g of fat|0.6g saturated fat|81,5mg cholesterol|31,3mg sodium|16,3g carbs|2g fiber|6,8g sugars|4,2 protein. All of this leaves you with plenty of room for your favourite toppings! Give it a try!
