This in a scheme of things isn't a huge deal, but it's really starting to bug me. My job requires me to drive to several Coastal Bend locations every month, places like Rockport, Odem/Sinton, Robstown, Beeville, etc. One thing I have noticed for literally now two decades is how out of date our population numbers are on our City Limits signs. I actually see on a regular basis up to 3 different sets of numbers on the signs, and I don't even see all the signs in the area! There are numbers from the 2000 census, the 2010 census and some weird set from somewhere in between. The sign from the 2000 census literally has moss growing on it and shows the city stuck at 277K For those keeping track, that sign has been unchanged for 21 years! There's another sign from 2010 that shows the number around 305K and a third sign, that I can't recall it's location that shows it at 280 thousand something. Seriously WTF? I see other cities that update their numbers mid-decade and think "why can't we do that? I think this must be a TXDOT thing maybe? Not too sure, but iv'e actually been in the car when someone saw a population sign and they said "You still only have 277K? I thought Corpus was bigger by now!" I then mumble something to the effect of "don't get me started" BY THE WAY, Ive been driving the roads here since 1993 and holy crap the traffic way worse, those idiots at the census better not tell me we only grew by 2% BS! /end rant
