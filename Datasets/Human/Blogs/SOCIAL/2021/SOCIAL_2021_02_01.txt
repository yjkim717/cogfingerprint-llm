Not having your ship makes for a somewhat difficult expedition. Some necessary resources (e.g. ferrite dust) are rather tricky to find. Thankfully, you'll find most resources you need at this trading post. ~~Better yet, if you want to cheat... you can just buy a ship from here \^_\^.~~ Finally, have a look at my PSA: Refiner Recipe Cheat Sheet guide for several useful recipes to manufacture raw materials that can otherwise be difficult to find, like silver for that Pilgrim geobay if you want to get around faster. EDIT: Unfortunately, I just tried to buy a ship and it seems that Hello Games disabled this feature specifically for this expedition. Regardless... the trading post is still quite useful.
