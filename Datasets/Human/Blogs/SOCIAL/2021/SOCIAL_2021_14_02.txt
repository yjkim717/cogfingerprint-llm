I take muffins (just over a year old) on walks whenever I can during the day. I’m working from home recently so this is something I can do more often. Now that I’m working from the office 2 days a week, she’s not getting walked as often, and when I get home at 7pm, she’s crying and howling at the door constantly from 7pm to Midnight. I know she wants walks, but my house backs on to bush and I’m not comfortable with either of us going out for walks. I was able to distract her with cat treats for a bit, but now I’m out of cat treats (I put kibble in the cat treat bag and it worked for about an hour before she realised it wasn’t treats). Playing with her used to work, but now she gets bored and starts howling at the door instead of playing. I can’t actually use my TV or downstairs area of a night anymore. I end up spending the night in the bedroom in the hopes that she thinks it’s sleep time and calms down. I just want to be able to use my TV and living room again. Does anyone have ideas?
