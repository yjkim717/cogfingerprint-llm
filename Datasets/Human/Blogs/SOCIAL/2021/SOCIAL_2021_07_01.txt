lately ive noticed i havent been using my brain as much as i would like. there are so many topics that interest me and that i would love to learn more about but i have no idea where to begin, thus leaving me unmotivated and uninterested on learning anything at all. if i had an easier way of starting and finding resources to learn then it wouldn't be so hard. i feel like this is such a stupid thing to ask but i honesty have no clue where to start. edit: WOW this definitely blew up! i will read and reply to your comments when i can, but i really appreciate the judgement-free feedback. thank you so much
