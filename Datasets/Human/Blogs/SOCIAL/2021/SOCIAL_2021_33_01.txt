So yesterday I was stopped at a stop light then I noticed a cop stop behind me. I started moving after the green light but of course I was going the exact speed limit because the cop was directly behind me. This caused a huge line of traffic behind me and when we go to an area where you can temporarily pass, a car from near the back of the line got in the left lane and started passing everyone at a high rate of speed. Eventually the passing lane ended but he still had about 3 or 4 cars to pass including me and the cop. And instead of getting in line he just goes to the opposite side of the road and passes us all on double yellows. I’m thinking to myself “ooo he’s in trouble now” But the cop did absolutely nothing even though he was obviously going way over the speed limit and passed illegally. It was kinda funny though because that car ended up getting stuck behind another line of traffic and I was right behind him the entire time.
