Yeah it sounds bad, I know, but I am beyond pissed right now, and for a damn good reason. I'm a housekeeper in a hotel, and by far, parents and their kids are the worst rooms I clean, some examples, side tables covered in syrup/something hella sticky, kentic sand everywhere, dirty diapers left out, paint dried to the carpet, fuckin GLITTER. But this, one room, fuck these people, idk who they were, but I I could, I would beat them to an inch of their life. Dirty pampers in the drawers, crush *used* tampons on the bathroom floor, half eaten food thrown about, gum rubbed into the carpet, crayon drawing on the wall, sand/gravel in the beds, and so much more. And I'm thinking to myself, "oh, just parents leaving their young kids in their room again", nah, the fuckers left a note in one of the beds, written in crayon saying "Fuck You Bitch", they did this all, on purpose. Most likely in front of their kids, and this is just, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Even the bachelors working in the campers leave a cleaner mess than parents Damn it, now I'm sad, cuz I remembered that some people think less of hose who work in hospitality Edit: Just remembered, that NEITHER of my co-workers who helped clean the room knew or interacted with these people
