i dont live in the city anymore but my friend wants to get her nose pierced and i want to send her to the best professional in the city, as golden horseshoe closed and gord doesnt pierce anymore. please dont say artistics as ive had and heard of many bad experiences there. any tattoo shops with APP certified piercers in the city? or will they have to travel to toronto where we have some here?
