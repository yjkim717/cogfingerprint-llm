Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, if so could someone point me in the right direction? Hey, so I'm considering making custom game cases for GB, GBC & GBA games. Here's my plan: GBA cases - GameCube cases but turn the Memory Card Slot into a GBA cart slot GB/GBC cases - either PSP game cases but turn the UMD slot into a GB/GBC cart slot or use Cassette cases &#x200B; Anyone have any idea on how I can make these and what I would need? I wanna make these as clean as possible so maybe use Blender for 3D editing and whatnot. &#x200B; Please & Thank You for reading & replying
