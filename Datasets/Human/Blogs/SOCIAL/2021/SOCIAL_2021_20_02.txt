I'm barely passing classes at this point. Skip classes and binge watch them on 2x speed right before tests. BS the online assignments because I'm too lazy to use my brain. It's too easy to get credit without learning anything. I think I put in 1 hour of work total last week. Spend 10 minutes working then spend the rest of the day on YouTube. I've never been this lazy in my life, not sure what's wrong with me (I'm not depressed though). Who else is out here living their laziest life?
