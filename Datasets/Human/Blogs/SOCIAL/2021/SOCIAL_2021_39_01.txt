So Im a junior of highschool fresh out here f the concert with the memory now forever burned into my mind. We were playing Emperata overture and at a dixieland jazz funeral and it went weirdly ok. We weren't out of tune and we sounded like we actually knew what we were doing! However as this was my first concert in a long while I kinda screwed it over for everyone. In Emperata when it got to the fast bit I played way to fast and loud and confident that the band director straight up turned around looked at me and just I'll never forget that face. At least dixieland was better but hoo boy. Just wanted to share it while the memory was still fresh, keep practicing y'all (with a metronome)
