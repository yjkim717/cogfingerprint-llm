Why isn’t it still “VOTE TO FORFEIT?” How to make a game into a sweatbox jail cell in one update. You’re always promoting players being LESS toxic. Well that’s just BS LOL. This means there’s no game mode you can just leave. But worse than that you’re messing with player psychology. Casual is supposed to be a fun non sweaty environment where you can try new stuff and if you lose it doesn’t matter. SO PLAYERS CAN LEARN! Now not only can I not leave so I’m stuck with toxic players but I have to choose to leave and choose that we have “lost” and that all my teammates agree or I get punished. WTAF Psyonix this update sucks. I don’t care if this is so you can implement chat. It feels like you’re trying to kill what makes this game good. No wonder no one wants to play anymore. Oh right we can’t see those numbers can we…
