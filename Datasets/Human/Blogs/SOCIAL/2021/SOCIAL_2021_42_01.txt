This same man bought a church right across the street from me. This isn't a big four lane road with businesses and stop lights. This is a small quiet neighborhood with roads with no lines. No side walks even. This man turned the former church into some kind of night club. He is renting it out for bachelor parties and wedding receptions and such but on Sunday nights there is some sort of rave going on with cars parked three deep and the ***boom-bada-boom***of loud music. Now he wants to turn the lot next to my house into a parking lot for the place and cut down three beautiful 100 year old trees. I am heart sick over this. I am going to try to talk to the man, politely, and ask, plead, beg if I have too, to please build the parking lot around the trees. But I don't know him or anything about him and I still feel like I will be waisting my breath. Me chaining myself to the tree was bandied about but I have to go to work and my boss would not understand. What really upsets me is that trees don't have any protection. How can it be legal to destroy them? 100 fricking years of providing shade, oxygen, and beauty means nothing when money can be made.
