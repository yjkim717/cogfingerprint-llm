Sorry I don’t have a picture or anything visual to help. The non dominant hand, horizontal 1 hand shape, palm towards you. Doesn’t move. Dominant hand, starts above non dominant hand in open 5, palm away. Moves away into an S. I’ve seen this often enough but clearly have no idea what it actually means. Any suggestions would be great. Thanks :)
