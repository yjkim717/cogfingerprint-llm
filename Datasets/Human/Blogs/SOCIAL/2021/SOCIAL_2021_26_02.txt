So I (25F) live in a plot of land with 3 houses. Theres a wall around the land and no fences between our houses, so we share a yard. My neighbors are my family. My uncle and aunt (both 70+) live in one house with their daughter, and their other daughter lives in the other house with her husband and kids. They all have dogs, there’s 2 big dogs and one small one. So I got a dog for christmas. He’s currently 4 months old and a little devil. So we try not to give him free reign of the yard. But twice already they have asked when i’m gonna neuter him. and every time we,ve told them what the vet said: 7 months. I was just a little uncomfortable with the situation but my uncle texted my mom asking again and making a big deal about how we have to protect their little princess (the little dog) how she’s not safe anymore, etc. That got me really upset and I really don’t think I can live here anymore if I can’t enjoy walking my dog (on a leash) without feeling judged because their dog comes to smell mine?? My mom was a little annoyed at me for being upset, but I can tell the constant nagging is starting to bother her too. So, AITA for getting mad over this?
