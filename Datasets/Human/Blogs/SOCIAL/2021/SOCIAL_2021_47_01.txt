Hi everyone, Im pretty new to this and started it because I wanted to get my life a little more organized. But I really struggle to write anything in my journal. I read many posts and stuff on what other people put in their journal, with tasks or mods trackers or stuff like that, but I don’t really k ow where to start and feel like I don’t have any tasks to write down... or I forget to write them down in the first place... Any good advice to overcome this issue (I hope this is just something I’ll face at the start of this until I made it a habit to just write stuff down)
