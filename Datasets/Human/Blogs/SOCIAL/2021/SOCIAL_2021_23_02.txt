My 4 1/2 month old kitten got neutered today and he’s having a really hard time with his cone. I’m tempted to take it off of him bc he hasn’t seemed interested in licking the incision but I’m not sure what to do. I’ve seen a lot of people online say that they didn’t keep their done on their cats after the procedure.
