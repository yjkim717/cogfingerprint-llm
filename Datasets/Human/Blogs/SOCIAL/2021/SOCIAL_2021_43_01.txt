Let me start by saying this...I love kids. I have 13 nieces and nephews and I love being an uncle and my wife loves being an aunt. However, that doesn't mean either of us have ever had or will have the desire to have children. It's official now. My wife works in an industry as a head of a department and one of her employees is about to go on her second maternity leave for 12 weeks leaving my wife with a shit ton more work and overtime even more than the 60+ hours she already works as a salaried director. Last time this employee went on leave it took my wife's stress level to a whole other level and while she never complained about it....at some point it's just plain unfair. Why do women who choose to have kids get 12 weeks *paid* leave and guaranteed their job when they come back when my wife who will never have children only have more work and an unfair burden ahead of her? Obviously I'm not slamming having kids and keeping ones job; I'm referring to my wife's situation of the fact that she will never see an added cent or paid time off from covering all these women who go on leave and burden my wife with covering both her job *and* theirs. After this employee has her baby and returns another one of my wife's employees is going straight on her maternity leave and my wife will never catch a break. My wife will never complain about the work or ever smoke any of them obviously they are almost like friends at this point...but why are we only rewarding women who *choose* to have babies and not those who are putting in more hours and dedication to a company and yet will never see any kind of compensation or bonus for time worked? The amount of FMLA is honestly a bit ridiculous and the time off for these mothers extends way beyond 12 weeks when yoi factor in doctor appointments, pregnancy sickness and others. Again, just to reiterate I have no issue with mothers having kids and keeping their jobs...but why can't people like my wife be rewarded after a certain amount of time or at least a 6 week vaca which is *half* of what each of these mothers get for each leave? Thanks for sticking with me...its just been on my mind for a while.
