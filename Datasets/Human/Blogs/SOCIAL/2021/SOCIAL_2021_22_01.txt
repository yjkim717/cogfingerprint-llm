I'm just tired of all the pain I'm in. And the only relief I get is when I'm on an anti inflammatory. But the amount I take to just take the edg off is bad for my liver. So I'm hoping to get put on something a bit stronger. Should I be talking about specific medications or hope for a pain management consultation?
