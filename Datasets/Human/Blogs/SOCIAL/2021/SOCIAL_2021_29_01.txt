Ok so a few weeks ago I tried to watch the original 1998 Berserk but I just couldn't get into it so I watched something else. When Kentaro Miura's Death was announced I felt terrible & felt as if I saw a drug deal, didn't report it, & then the next day found out that same drug dealer ended up shooting & killing a kid later that night. Ever since his death was announced I've been trying to watch it to honor his work but for whatever reason I just can't get into it. I don't know if it's because I have to watch it on a shady anime pirate website because it isn't sold anywhere else, if the story just disinterest me, or if I just don't like it. But for whatever reason I can't watch it & I haven't been able to watch anything else since his passing because I feel so guilty.
