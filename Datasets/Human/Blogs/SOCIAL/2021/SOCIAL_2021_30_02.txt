I keep seeing people on here talking about Eichel like him being a ranger is inevitable, i really hope not, hes got a herniated disk in his neck which makes it hard to evaluate his future, was on by far the worst team in the NHL and and didn't do much to lift it up, they started like 5-16 with him on the ice. Most importantly he doesn't have a spot on the roster, Zibby should never be traded if he plays like he did this season shit after his slump he had 21 goals in 29 games, thats crazy... Strome is a solid C and his play for the majority of this season should merit a little bit more time, plus start thinking about cap, gonna be hard to pay Fox, Zib, Shesterkin, and inevitable Laffy, Kakko and Kravtstov, if Eichel is here many of these players wont be able to resign if we have major cap players on this team, it was one of my main reasons of liking the young and fast rebuild. Chytil shouldn't be traded and needs at least one more full non covid year to properly evaluate. 4th center next year should be Morgan Barron, he played outstanding in the few games we got to see him play, and the fact that he was already willing to fight for this team in the captials fight night game spoke very loud to me, hes a big ole yes for me. So where does that leave us, trade Zibby for Eichel, ok well its a mistake imo and Zibby is a far better player but if it happens we lose our best goal scorer and we will have issues scoring next year, trade strome/chytil ok well then expect cap problems shortly after, if we were on the cusp of a stanley cup id say sure lets trade something and see if he can help us get to that next level but even then id be hard thought about going after him or not due to his injury. I know its an unpopular opinion but imo a trade like this is detrimental to the rebuild. edit - this article is a good read about a herniated disc injury to a sports player and why its got me nervous about Eichels recovery in it self `h``ere` edit 2 - for those saying Eichel has been a better goal scorer recently, in the past 193 games Zibby has 94 goals, in the past 233 games Eichel has 91, thats a 40 game difference edit 3 - for everyone saying we need more grit, keep in mind during that scrum most of our grit was injured or not playing, Lindgren has the most grit by far, Trouba and Kreider can be gritty when needed, Morgan Barron showed he had grit, while i agree this team needs more grit i dont want to see people come in just because we need grit when our team already has it and they were just injured or not playing, they also need to be good players, plus players like Gauthier and Miller are huge and need to show more grit and Miller needs to body check more, when he does it looks like a train hits someone
