Already plan to stop communicating with my step father once I move out in a few months. But I’m also starting to think of going either extremely low contact or no contact with my mother. There’s just too much toxicity in this house. Both of them try to get back at each other by doing worse things than what was previously done. Every argument (at least 5 or so per day and have had some go on for upwards of 4 hours) one or both end up mentioning me and trying to say the other needs to stop because I need to be left alone, trying to talk to me about the topic saying to try to get the other to stop, or bringing my name up in general. With my mother saying I’m going against her because I don’t share her opinion. My body feels like it’s on non stop stress mode and I’m tired of it. Any mention of my mother restraining me for hours (ages 5-8 or 9) JUST because a DSS worker said it was ok, causing me to be terrified of being touched, being trapped in my room for hours not able to get food, water or use the bathroom, being neglected from doctor or dental care because 10 bags of the same chip and meat we won’t eat and get thrown out were more important, continually bringing in another abuser into this house and then openly blames me for her marrying this man, etc. At this point I don’t know or care about what happened in their past. I just want away. It feels like walking on egg shells all the time even just trying to express a different opinion. Even me being around seems to make them worse because they involve me. All of these excuses as to why it’s my fault she married him, why I was restrained for hours over anything, even having my extra FAFSA money taken to pay rent for her other house because her renter couldn’t. I want out. All I wanted was a normal family and peace. Just happy I can remove myself within 2 months.
