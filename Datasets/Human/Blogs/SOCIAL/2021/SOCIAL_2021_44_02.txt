This happened yesterday, but it definitely still counts as a fuckup. Last night after dinner, I was still hungry and thought I’d make myself a salad. I had some leftover veggies I wanted to use up, so I chopped them up, made myself some vinaigrette from scratch, and sat down to eat. Several things are relevant here: - I often watch TV while I eat. - About 15 years ago, my dentist bonded a new ceramic onto a partially broken front tooth of mine after the old ceramic broke (the actual tooth damage happened about 25 years ago - yes, I am old). So anyway, I’m watching my show, eating my salad, mentally praising myself for being so thrifty and creative for making a freaking salad, and not paying too much attention, when I accidentally bite down too hard on my fork. CRUNCH. It didn’t ruin the entire bonded part, but it put a big enough dent in it that I texted my dentist in a panic asking if she could take a look at it the next day. She texted back saying she’d see when she got into work, expressed surprise that it had lasted so long, and praised me for taking good care of my teeth. Tl;dr I attempted to eat a salad and literally forked up an already janky tooth. UPDATE: I have an appointment for Friday to get it fixed. It pays to have a dentist in the family.
