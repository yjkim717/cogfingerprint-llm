I just rewatched *Inside* with my fiancé and she told me to pay close attention to the use of lighting, so I tried to ask myself what Bo was saying with his use of light and color in every scene. However, I think I started picking up on something he probably didn't intend. My fiancé and I have gotten into gardening a lot recently, and in "FaceTime with my Mom" I seriously thought for a minute or so that Bo was symbolizing his personal growth with the use of grow lamps shining down on him (my fiancé assured me quickly that it was almost certainly blue to resemble a cell phone, and I know that's probably what he meant). I was just wondering, did anyone else who grows plants see a grow lamp?
