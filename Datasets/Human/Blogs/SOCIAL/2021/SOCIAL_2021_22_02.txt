I should preface this by saying I do belive nuclear energy has its place and its far better than coal/ natural gass. However one thing has bothered me for quite a while. Once the fuel rods are spent and they go through the proper procedures of storage, they are still being stored away underground because we can't do anything with it. Isn't that just as reckless? Aren't we basically just taking the waste and burying and saying "That's not our problem. That's something for future generations to worry about." Isn't the whole point of stepping away from natural gass is to help not only us in the present. But also for the next generation? And yet some how there is a lot of emphasis on building many more nuclear power plants, many, many more. It just feels kind of stupid to knowingly cause trouble and potential danger to the people later in history when we are shoving our problems onto them cause we cant/won't deal with it. Which is what got us into this whole mess in the first place. So how is this any better than what has happened in the past?
