I was diagnosed with depression and am on meds. Someday are hard and I don't brush my teeth, but do makeup. I will go full glam and lashes on occasion just to go to work, but will still not brush my teeth. My parents said that me doing my makeup makes it hard to believe my depression is really that bad and makes it seem like I am making excuses to be lazy. Now my anxiety is telling me I should stop doing my makeup so that when I say I struggle it looks more believable and I can actually get help. But they also said they believe something is wrong with me, and said my brother thinks my brain is fucked and they all walk on eggshells around me and are hurt by me not caring for anyone. They said they want to encourage me to be a responsible adult and do well in life and they only say these things because they love me. I don't know what to do. I just am done.
