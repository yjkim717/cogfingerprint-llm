So Rosie 4(years) is and absolutely lovable dog that never nips or bites, loves pets even from strangers (unless they are black, bad experience with a guy), and seldom barks even though she's an English mastiff. However when we take her to dog parks she gets really aggressive and just stays by us and barks at anything that comes near her. It's kind of a whining bark though not supper agressive but gets the point across. What's weird though is we have a second dog (Sammy) that we got 6 months ago that she tolerates and plays with just fine. She never barked at that one. So why is she doing that and how can I get her to be more comfortable with other dogs. It's a pain because I want to socialize Sammy but don't like leaving Rosie at home. Any advice?
