If disney were to make a live action film trilogy based on the Darth Bane books, who would be your dream cast? Some obvious ones I have seen floating around are Tom Hardy as Bane...again, Margot Robbie as Zannah, but can you think of anyone else who would fit as well? I think Manu Bennett could also do a good Bane, and Anya Taylor-Joy could also do a good Zannah. For the others, some of my picks would be: Lord Kaan: Rufus Sewell Lord Qordis: Ralph Fiennes Lord Kas'im: Peter Mensah Sirak: Joel Kinnaman Githany: Charlize Theron General Hoth: Toby Stephens Valenthyne Farfalla: Travis Fimmel Darovit: Jared Leto Johun: Joseph Gordon-Levitt Hetton: Michael McElhatton Caleb: Scott Glenn Serra: Brie Larson Lucia: Michelle Rodriguez Set Harth: Jake Gyllenhaal &#x200B; What do you think, who would you choose and is there someone I missed?
