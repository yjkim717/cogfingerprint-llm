I work in a small neighborhood market. As soon as I came in today my boss told me one of regular customers died last night. She came through the drive thru and always wanted to look at the lotto board. She had a dog. She just bought a new minivan and had a knee replacement. She was nice and funny and I'll never see her again. I've been crying for almost two hours and grilling other regulars about their health. I lost my librarian a month ago. I had to call the library to find out why she hadn't been coming in and they told me. If you stop at a little carry out every night to get your beer or cigarettes or to play your numbers, don't ever think we don't love you. We get used to seeing you and when your gone it leaves a void on our lives.
