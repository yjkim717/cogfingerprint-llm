My girlfriend (F, 19, 5’8”, 120 lb, white, no meds, no smoking, occasional drinking) lost consciousness from the time of the crash until paramedics arrived. No clue if it was one minute or several minutes. At the ER they said her head ct looked fine, but a notable amount of clear fluid leaked from her ear. She told the nurse about this and a neurology doctor checked her ct and didn’t see anything major. I’m concerned because they said mild even though her symptoms are nothing near mild and she lost consciousness so doesn’t that automatically make her head injury more than mild? Is it worth going to the doctor today to get double checked or should she just rest and wait?
