I quit my game a few days ago with my Seamoth safe & sound parked beside my Safe Shallows base while I was standing on the bridge of my Cyclops. When I started up my game today, my Seamoth was just suddenly gone! There's not even a beacon for it or anything. I can't imagine what I might have done to cause this - it wasn't in a place where it'd get attacked and it wasn't beached on land or anything. The only thing I can think of is maybe I left it parked too close to my base, so that while everything was loading in today it briefly got clipped on something which destroyed it? I was playing in VR mode, with the VR Enhancements mod for what it's worth. Don't know whether that might have contributed. Such a glitchy game. Still, despite that it's still among my top favorite VR games. EDIT: Gah! I think I might know what happened. Those damned crabsnakes I released into the kelp beds. They're not aggressive to *me*, but I didn't realize they'd attack unmanned seamoths. I'm surprised they never attacked my prawn suit before - I kept it parked even closer to them.
