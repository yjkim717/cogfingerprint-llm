I'm teetering on the edge of mentally breaking again, and I just can't again, I've come so far and worked so hard to pull myself up. Yet the terrible family secret my father told me about has me about to break as I just am failing to cope and process it right now. I'm seeking counseling as I just cannot regress, I have to keep moving forward, yet I'm unsure of what the future will hold for me given it's just never ending. Something new and terrible happens to me or someone I know, and it just edges me closer and closer to my limit.
