I hope this post isn't breaking any of the rules, if it is, please remove it. I'm looking for some advice and maybe some other people can benefit from this as well. I feel like nothing I do in my life really 'means' anything to me. TL:DR me whining and ranting about not knowing what I wanna be/do 10 years from now and how (/or even why) to get there &#x200B; I have no idea where I want to be in 10 years. If you ask me for my hobbies, there is little I can tell you except for the 1-2 things I do out of habit. I have no passion for my job. I am trying to better myself, i started running and plan on running a marathon this year and I started playing the piano again and try very hard to get 1-2 hours of practice in every week but I feel like I don't even really know why I do this. I don't know where I want to go with this, I can't even really describe it but to me it feels just so hard to just do anything. And then when I think about what might be in 5 or 10 years, it crushes me because I have absolutely no idea, I see absolutely no future for myself (not in a suicidal way, don't worry). I simply have no idea what I'm doing it all for. I know I'm overthinking mostly everything in my life and in the end I achieve a lot less than I could've if I had just started doing it. But what is that IT that I should start doing?? I feel stuck!
