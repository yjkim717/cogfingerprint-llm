I've started to make Naruto videos on tiktok where i explain some sub characters for people who dont know too much about the show, currently i have covered Anko, Shisui and Rin. Any more cool characters that could make an interesting video? I don't really want to talk about the main characters in the show unless there are some parts about them that cause confusion. Looking for suggestions for things that arent common knowledge about the show and characters in it so any ideas are welcome. i research what i make as much as i can to make sure it is accurate. i only have a handfull of videos but i want to make 1 or 2 a day If you're interested my username is fazefat
