I don't know where else to post /say this so sorry in advance :) Today had my 1st date in forever! Legit almost a year ago before covid started was the last time I was with a guy, that one quickly ended and good so. It felt great and he was so handsome! Seemeed to have stuff in common and come from similar backgrounds. And at the end, he asked if he could kiss me and was amazing. Wasn't just a peck, but an actual kiss. A hookup guy kissing u, but a guy u into hits different imo. Was kinda awkward on my part, hope I didn't spoil it :( I wanted to hold his hand all throughout but was too shy smh. Both said we wanted to see each other again, fingers crossed. Felt so good on the drive back home, that butterfly feeling. Sorry for the short rant, just wanted to tell anyone who'd listen. â˜ºðŸ˜„
