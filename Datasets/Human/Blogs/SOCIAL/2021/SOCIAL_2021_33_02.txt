I’m only 21 but basically all I do is work. When I finally get home after a long day at work, time seems to go by 100X faster and before I know it, it’s time to go back to sleep and back to work again. I work 5, sometimes 6 days a week. On my days off Im usually stuck doing something I don’t want to do like but has to be done like yard work, car repairs, appointments, etc the. Before I know it the whole days over immediately. I feel like there’s barely anytime to relax and do anything but the rest of my life is gonna be this way? I don’t want that. I don’t hate my job at all and I don’t mind working but I just hate the amount of time it takes up, I barely get to see my family or friends and when I do get to it’s not for very long. I get 2 weeks of vacation a year. That’s not nearly enough time to enjoy much. I’m scared that one day I’m gonna wake up as an old man and think about all the time I had and how I wasted it away working. Why do we have to work until we are to old to work anymore? Because by that time we are too old to enjoy anything.
