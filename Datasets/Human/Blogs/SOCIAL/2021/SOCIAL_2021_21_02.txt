This is probably common sense but it was not common sense to me at age 17. If you are anxious or frenetic it's easy to accept whatever advice people give you and take their word as law. However, you have to realize that in any situation where you're taking advice, your "mentor" is living a completely different life than you are, in infinitely many ways. It's important to realize that the person who understands your situation best is you, and thus you are logically the best person to be combating your own issues. While you may not have an answer to your problems now, it helps to work through them primarily using your own judgement. Ultimately it's your life, and there's no right or wrong way to live it.
