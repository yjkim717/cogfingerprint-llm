Hey guys, I'm a third year in a BSN program and I really want to work as a PCT. I have great grades, and a strong work history (just not healthcare related). I have no prior healthcare experience except my clinicals, but a lot of the hospitals near me advertise jobs for nursing students. I've applied to a few of these and got rejected from one with no explanation; haven't heard back from the other two. Does anyone have any tips on applying for these jobs?
