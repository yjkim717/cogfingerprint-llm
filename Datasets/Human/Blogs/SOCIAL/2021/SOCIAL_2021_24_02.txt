Hello everyone! I'm currently setting up a minecraft server via SSH on a server running Ubuntu without any GUI. The server is running in a screen-environment. Starting the server and playing on it is no problem. Also most datapacks (Vanilla tweaks for example) work when put into the world's datapack folder after it generates (I'm using a tool that allows me to view the folders with a GUI). But for the datapack "many more biomes" (And others that concern world generation), the instructions call for the datapack to be put into the datapack folder of the world when creating it. As there is no GUI on the ubuntu server, this option does not exist and I can't get the server to work with the datapack. I tried creating a folder with the world's name with a "datapack" folder inside, before running the command "java -Xms8G -Xmx12G -jar minecraft\_server\_1.16.4.jar nogui" but the new biomes still don't generate. The datapack is highlighted as active though, and the new biomes are recognized by the /locatebiome command, but never found. So here is my question: How do I put a datapack into the temporary datapack folder that only exists when clicking datapack in the "new world" screen, if I don't have a "new world" screen?
