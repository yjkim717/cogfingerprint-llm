I have the strongest memory of reading something on Fanfiction.net more than 10 years ago, probably closer to 15. The parts I remember were: \- Lily and Remus are prefects together. So that she doesn't realize he's a werewolf, James polyjuices himself to be Remus when the full moon overlaps with the nights they have to patrol. Does this sound familiar to anyone?
