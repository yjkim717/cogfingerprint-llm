I've been watching videos on obscure old toys and found out that a rocket-firing Boba Fett appeared on Pawn Stars at one point. I'm confused by this. I know Pawn Shops have to return any stolen items they come into possession of, and that toy was never officially released, so the seller could only have come into possession of it if an employee of the manufacturer stole a prototype. Could someone explain how this works?
