Hello all! I've been doing a decent amount of research on Nissan Leaf's the past year and I really like them. My plan is to buy a 2019 CPO that's coming off of it's lease for around 15-17K. Leaf's depreciate like a mofo. But now I'm wondering if I should just wait and do the same with a Bolt? My only concern is the seats, I can't do uncomfortable seats and I have read that the first gen Bolts seats aren't great for comfort. I'm curious to hear your thoughts and thank you for letting me join this group!
