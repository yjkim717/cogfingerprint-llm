I was just on a youtube binge of watching them shop and the show always showcased (exploited) the way that the people would shop and of course it had the comments and stares from other customers. The people would always want to shop quickly and get out always made me wondered why, if it was available in their area, they didnt put in a grocery order to be delivered but it could just be the show doing this. What are your thoughts?
