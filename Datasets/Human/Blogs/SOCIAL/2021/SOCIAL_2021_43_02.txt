I see quite a few wheelchair or handicapped people lately with service dogs lately who might go down the street or in a store but mainly have their dog lay on the ground for hours at a time. How does that dog get his energy out/be a dog at the end of the day (sniff in a yard? Do other people walk it?) Just curious and appreciate anyone who knows!
