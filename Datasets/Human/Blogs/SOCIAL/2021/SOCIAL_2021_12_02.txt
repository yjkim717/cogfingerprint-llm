First time owner. I bought a kitten yesterday around 11am friday. Its not 1am saturday morning and she hasnt pooped yet . Shes had one or 2 pees. Shes had plenty to eat and drink. I think it may be nerves but im not sure if i should be concerned. Ahe was completely fine before i picked her up so im hoping its just nerves. Ive tried to massage her stomache but nothings really heping her
