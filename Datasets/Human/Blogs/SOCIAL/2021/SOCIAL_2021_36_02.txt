Elementary, Gossip Girl, even Law & Order to some extent all do the same thing, where they act like they don't know what a pain in the ass it is to get around NYC. They show up to a place for 10 minutes, and then head out and immediately show up to the next one. The most egregious example is the Thanksgiving episode in Season 1 of Gossip Girl. On the day of Thanksgiving, in New York City, these children travel from Williamsburg to the UES multiple times in a day. Just once, I would like a show that shows what a pain in the ass it is to get around the city. Have the Law & Order detectives sitting in traffic while they try to get through Manhattan at rush hour. Show people changing trains 3 times and waiting on the platforms. Make an episode, where instead of everyone showing up to a location for 5 minutes, we only see when they are leaving, and watch them navigate around while recapping the 5 min conversation they just had and their next plans.
