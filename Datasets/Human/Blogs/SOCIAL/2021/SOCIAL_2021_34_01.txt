I intended on starting at noon. It’s 4. I’ve done nothing. I know what I need to do and it’s not too much. Well I have lots that needs to be done soon, but I made my goals for the day pretty simple and small. I just need to go through my clothes and find clothes to get rid of. Maybe go through other parts of my room after since I’m moving next week. Then clean the kitchen and start dinner. I took my adderall. I don’t know how else to break this executive dysfunction right now. Any advice/motivational tips?
