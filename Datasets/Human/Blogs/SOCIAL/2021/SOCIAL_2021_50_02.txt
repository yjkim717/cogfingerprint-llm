The majority of successful movies range from a 1 hour and 50 minute to a 2 hour and 20 minute runtime, with a few rare exceptions such as a Christopher Nolan movie, Avatar, Titanic or Avengers: Endgame. I was curious: what are some movies that are 2 1/2 hours long (or longer) which crossed at least 200 million? Ford v Ferrari is 2 hours and 32 minutes and that grossed 225 million, but I couldn't find much else.
