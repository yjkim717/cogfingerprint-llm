I don't do sausages/dogs because they make me feel sick (meat versions, at least) and I'm not huge into bacon. I'm looking into grounds, meatballs, breakfast sausage, Gimme Lean Sausage (I think like a ground), and tempeh since those are what is available near me. I've never had tempeh. PS. I hope this is vegan and okay here. I know they are plant based.
