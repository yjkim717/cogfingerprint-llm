I’m 24 years old currently. Broke the news about 3 weeks ago that I got an apartment a state and a half away. She keeps getting either mad, saying I can’t do it and will probably fail, or crying because she thinks that I’ll do what my 2 sisters have done with never seeing her or calling much. I keep trying to tell her that I won’t do that and will visit her and visit my cats. I want out of this house so I can work on other things and myself but she’s making me feel extremely guilty. Even anywhere in the state but the county I’m in she claims is too far. I understand that she wants to see her other daughters but that’s something she need to tell them she wants to see them. Is this normal?
