Ate dinner about an hour ago. It was a heavy, greasy meal. Started having some cramping and D* about 30 min ago. Here’s some backstory: I’ve been constipated for a couple weeks now, things have been slowly but surely starting to move the last few days but definitely constipated. I got my period yesterday. Today I was out in the sun at an amusement park for about 4 hours. It was insanely hot at 97 degrees F (36 Celsius) and over 60% humidity, and I was only able to drink maybe 12 to 16 ounces of water. My stomach itself feels fine. I don’t feel n*. My body feels ok otherwise, though now i’m shaking and on the verge of a panic attack. But i’m freaking the fuck out. What do y’all think is happening to me?? Am I s*?? Is this an SV?? Please help me. I don’t know if I can do this.
