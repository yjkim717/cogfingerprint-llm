Hihi! I've seen more and more art of vitiligo characters because it looks pretty. My question is, what do you think of it? I'd love to draw characters with vitiligo since I think it looks so cool but I would never want to offend anyone suffering with this disease or make light of it for aesthetic purposes. Please tell me what you think!
