I hate summer. There's this constant pressure of being happy and enjoying life. There's suffocatingly hot air that makes me feel like I can't breathe. There's everyone wearing lighter clothing that I can't wear because it makes me feel self conscious (and the subsequent "why dont you wear a nice skirt some time" by all of my relatives). While in theory I can objectively recognize that the warm weather is nice, in practice it just makes me want to curl up under a blanket and never come out for six months. And the worst part is that people always think that I'm trying to be edgy and "not like the other girls" when I start venting about this even in the slightest. I'm not trying to be edgy, I just dont like the warm seasons because they make me anxious and sad.
