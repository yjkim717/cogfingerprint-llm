Maybe not Impossible, but the difficulty spike came out of nowhere. Grounded has been pretty difficult, but always manageable and fun, but my god the part when you need to wait for Lev and Yara to open the gate for you is seriously frustrating the hell out of me. I manage to kill the first wave of infected with my upgraded melee weapon, but during the second wave with the shamblers I just have no way of doing this. My supplies are as follow: -1 heavy pistol round -1 pistol round -4 AR rounds -4 shotgun rounds -1 brick (with 2 extra laying around) Now I use the pistol round to stun the first clicker, and then one hit melee kill it. I use the brick to kill the runner that spawns next. I use 2 AR rounds to kill the remaining clickers, and one more brick to kill the runner that spawns. This leaves me with the below to kill 2 shamblers: -1 heavy pistol round -2 AR rounds -4 Shotgun rounds -1 brick It honestly isn’t enough and I don’t know what to do other than reload a save 2 hours prior to collect more items for crafting pipe bombs. Is there anyway I can avoid doing that and work with what I got?
