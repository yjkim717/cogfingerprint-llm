Ive been very consistent in teaching my dog not to bite but heâ€™s teething right now so itâ€™s obvious hard for him. But heâ€™s getting the hang of it, so much that he realizes he shouldnâ€™t. Sometimes when he really want to nibble on my arm heâ€™ll yawn and while his mouth is open just sticks my arm inside and slowly closes his mouth, heâ€™ll just nibble a couple times and then I give him the look and heâ€™ll stop. I feel like i shouldnâ€™t enable him but itâ€™s so cute ðŸ˜­
