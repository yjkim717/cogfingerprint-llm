Title says it all. I got my dream job back in August but it’s environmental work so since the cold weather hit we have been inside and it’s not good for my mental health. My eating disorder has been horrible since I was 17, I’m 25 now. I’ve have therapists and was in treatment in 2018 but left without their approval and fell back into b/p almost immediately. After hundreds of breakdowns tonight was the last one I can take and I am wanting to re admit myself to treatment but my full time job doesn’t leave much room for that. I want to take a leave or go to part time so I can focus most my energy on healing, not work but idk how to even initiate that conversation. I’m a new employee on a small team of 6 for a not for profit organization and feel like I’ll be letting so many people down :( my team members think I’m some cheery girl and my family thinks I’ve overcome this and were finally proud I got a good job and was doing “better” my bf is the only one that knows the truth and my ed hurts him and our relationship... all I want is to get better :(
