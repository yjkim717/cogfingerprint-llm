So I wanna get a condo or a small 2br close to the city... y'know... where everyone fucking works and lives already anyway. There's fucking nothing anywhere to buy. There's a glut of apartments for rent, but fuckin no condos anywhere. So I start in the main city core, there's 0. Nothing. Not a single thing that meets my basic requirements of a 700-1000sqft two bedroom. I go two cities out where I can still take a train or bike into the city. $1 million for a fucking two bedroom in a multi tenant building *in a location that's not even good.* Like what the fuck? How tf can so many people afford to buy these? I decide to check out outside the city. I see *beautiful,* renovated, absolutely perfect condos everywhere. They're inexpensive, they're basically everything I've ever wanted in a place. The town itself is slightly meh, but not bad. ... BUT I DON'T FUCKING WANNA DRIVE FOR 1-2HR TO WORK EVERY DAY. I don't want to be tied to a fucking car all the time. A little bit of traffic and you're fucking out. I keep checking in on this place and it just sits on the market, untouched, for like, a year or two. Why the actual fuck can't anyone just build more fucking condos in the fucking city????? What's so fucking hard about it? You can build and renovate in these shitty little towns that no one is gonna want to live in, but can't in the literal most desirable area?
