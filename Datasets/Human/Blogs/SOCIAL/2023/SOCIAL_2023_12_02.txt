can anyone help i had an oppo find x3 lite front camera is just so unusable. this is from its own camera app. snapchat and app based cameras are even worse. it seems to intensify the light, create a lot of noise, and wash out most the photos theres a distinct lack of options for the camera too, the rear camera looks ..ok..but cant exactly take photos of myself with the rear cam
