I did engineering in 8th grade and throughout all four years of high school. I was absolutely in love with it the whole time. Like 9/10 opinion of engineering until senior year of high school. I started my university program for it and was still at a 9/10 but unfortunately the pandemic lockdown happened at the 3/4 mark of my first year and among other things in my life, my love for engineering really took a downturn. There were a few times where I genuinely thought "damn this is not worth all the effort, I'm just gonna go buy land in Montana and be a chicken rancher" and this is where my enjoyment of engineering was like a 3/10. It just wasn't the same vibe doing classes from home and having no hands-on projects to do. As I've been back to in person classes and doing hands-on projects it's a lot better. Now I'm on my last semester as a 5th year and I think I'm sitting at like a 5/10 love for engineering. I can't tell if the passion will come back when I get into the workforce but I hope it does.
