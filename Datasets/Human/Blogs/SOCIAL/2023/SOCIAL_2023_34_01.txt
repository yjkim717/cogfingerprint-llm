First slide is current hair with peek-a-boo platinum under. The last few inches of my hair is colored pretty close to my natural color just a bit more red. I think I’m a natural ashy level 5+ that lightens a little in the sun to maybe a level 6 on my ends. I havent had my natural hair grown out since I was 15 and it was getting darker every year so Im not for sure. The second slide is a picture of what my natural color was back then. Ive heard that there’s now much less damaging lightening methods so Im wondering what those are and what may work best for me. I’m looking to be like a level 6.5ish I think? I have pictures attached of the shade I would like (3rd and 4th slide). I’m going in for a haircut next week so I’ll talk to a stylist, but just curious about all the options I have in case she is unable to do the least damaging method that way I can find a different stylist for the job. (Also I’m willing to wait until all of the colored hair is grown out and cut off if it’ll make a big difference in the process).
