Mainly making this as a PSA for people to know how to stop them from following you. If you go into your account settings, you can turn off the ability for people to following you, disabling them from them being able to spam you constantly with follower messages. As the infuriating part is you can't report them, and they know that, and it's why their doing what their doing. Personally I got several follows over the past few days, and thankfully learned how to stop it. So hopefully this helps others that are getting just as frustrated with it too.
