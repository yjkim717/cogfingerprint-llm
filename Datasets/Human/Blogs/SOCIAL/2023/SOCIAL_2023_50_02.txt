I watched the movie in cinemas two days ago, and it is incredibly arthouse and not at all friendly to mainstream audience. It clearly has no financial viability, and despite this, A24 greenlit it with a 25 million budget, only for it to make 2.7 million in its opening weekend. My question is: what is the thought process behind green lighting something with such little box office potential?
