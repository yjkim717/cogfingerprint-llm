The underlying connotation I'm looking for is someone who's almost aggressively watching something, like a cat hunting a mouse or something Imagine a boss who, every day, checks every employees check in time and disciplines anyone who was any amount late >He watched the attendance so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that even 1 minute late would result in a penalty to pay I want to say "hawkishly" but that doesn't sound *quite* right.
