I ordered my first Subaru in November! Super excited. My dealer tells me that it still says “January” is the estimated delivery, and there’s no VIN available yet. I’m not at all trying to complain—I know about the chip shortage and this is just reality of car buying these days. However, I’m moving mid-February, so I’m a little worried. How far in advance is the VIN and delivery date usually available to the dealer? Thanks!
