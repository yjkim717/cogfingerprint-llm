I dunno what happened in the middle, but I was pretty happy with how this game started and ended. But for those who are more skilled than I, I have a question, how do you find a good budget ball (used is fine)? I'm looking to get my own ball so I don't have to use the house balls that differ every time I go bowling. (Or anyone in West Houston want to sell me a ball? Lol)
