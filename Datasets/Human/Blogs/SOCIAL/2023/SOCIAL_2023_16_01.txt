I hate the terrible job blizzard does with balancing the game, although this is true for all their games, they pretty much are infamous for this issue. Along with the community sucks IMO, people are crass, rude and have a hairline trigger temper tantrum given when you get curb stomped for an entire match. It just brings the worst out of you given you typically are up against high end players or smurfs that are stomping ants in competitive or quick play. That just turns me away from the game for long periods of time, I like the concept and how the game works. Yet the above issues just bring the worst out of me each and every time and eventually steers me away from the game for months at a time.
