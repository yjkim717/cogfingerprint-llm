I bought a PC a few years ago because graphics cards were so expensive. I'm now looking to upgrade my graphics card and memory. I'm a casual gamer and am thinking about the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060. Is that something that will be good for the next 3ish years? I'm not getting the latest games, so I don't need the best and latest. In addition, I want to add more memory. I have open slots, but am not sure if it's better to replace my existing cards or to just add in more? I have an HP Gaming Desktop TG01. I'm looking to improve my experience with Borderlands 3 or Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. I can run both but it's painful. I figure the memory will help
