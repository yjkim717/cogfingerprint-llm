My homeless friend asked for some sports bras or leggings to wear under their clothes (they didn’t elaborate but I assume it probably has to do with them being closeted trans/feeling like a woman). I’m not trans but am a lesbian so I have some knowledge of trans issues and understand that if they have to live on the streets for the foreseeable future then they’ll probably never feel able to be out for safety reasons. I’m going to get them what they asked for but any other ideas on how else I can help them/other items I can get them? They were really nervous to ask so I feel like there’s probably more that they’d like but they just went with the safest ask. I don’t get the chance to regularly speak with them as they’re just someone I see once a week or so on my way to work and chat with while at a red light. Finally had the chance to meet on foot and chat for longer than 2 minutes when I drove around the area to find them and give them a care package.
