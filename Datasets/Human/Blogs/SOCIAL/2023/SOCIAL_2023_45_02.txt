This is my first cruise on RC, so I wanted to see if what I've done on other cruise lines will work on Voyager of the Seas. I prefer to charge my phone on my night stand, and I also like to have a small USB-powered fan there too. So on other lines I bring along a pass-through plug adapter that has several USB ports. I unplug the lamp from the outlet underneath my bed, plug in the adapter, plug the lamp back into it, then use the USB ports for my phone and fan. Works like a charm on nearly any Carnival ship. Will it work on Voyager of the Seas, or are the lamps hard-wired or something unusual like that?
