I'm doing my second playthrough and the first one I found a note on Art that helped advance the quest. This time the fists are guarding him and said they found a note on him so I figured Id get it but they didnt give me anything. I than went exploring and a long rest figured maybe I need to wait. I had the fight with Marcus and went back but all the fists still have nothing for me its just repeating dialogue. Am I going to have to re load so I can progress this or is there some fix? TIA
