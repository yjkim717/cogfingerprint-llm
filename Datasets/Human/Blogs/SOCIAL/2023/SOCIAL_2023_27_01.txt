25m 2 years in part time. I've accepted it's gonna be a while before im a RPCD, So I started thinking about staying a preloader at 3am, then driving to FedEx Ground at 9am to deliver for a contractor until peak season when I drive for UPS. Being on call at UPS makes it hard to keep a second job. Any thoughts?
