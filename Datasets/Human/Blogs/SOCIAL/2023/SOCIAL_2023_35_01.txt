Hi, my younger brother has an old early 90s Toyota pickup. The rear end blew up on him, he has all the parts to fix it, however, the bolts rusted to the point they seized. When he tried to remove them, the bolts ended up becoming stripped. We do not have a cutting torch, so hoping for some strategy to get them loose without one. If anyone has any ideas I would love them. I am not a mechanic in any way, but really would love to help him.
