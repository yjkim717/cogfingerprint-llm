I got a card at a gas station because I had to have $60 on a card by 10 am the next day. I went to activate it so I could pay my bill. Apparently I had a NetSpend card 10 years ago so I can never have one again. So after an hour on hold I finally talked to someone who told me, sorry but you can't have your money. We will have to send you a check in 10 to 15 business days which is about 2 or 3 months. I am so angry. I told them to overnight the check to me but of course that can't do that. I am screwed because that was my last $60. So I can't pay tomorrow. So I have to leave the motel and go, I don't know where. I have no idea. I'm screwed because I put money on a NetSpend card.
