I know this might not be the best place to discuss this, but Iâ€™m going to post here anyway to try and get some input. In the final season 19 episode, David talked about the Season Pass was going away and being replaced with a subscription model for seasons 20 and beyond. My question is will I have permanent access to season 20 and beyond? The advantage of Season Pass was that once I bought it, I have permanent access to the episodes forever. I love it. Will that be the same thing for the subscription model? Or if I stop paying, will access to past episodes disappear? Will the RSS feed be smart enough and cut off access to past episodes if I decide to stop the subscription? If I can only access the episodes when I subscribe to this format and only this format, then I am very unsure if this is a model I want to support.
