I want to read some books with melancholy scenes where the character finds themselves somewhere at night, perhaps in a strange place, directly or indirectly contemplating whatever situation they are currently in. >!Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto and The Goldfinch/The Secret History by Donna Tartt!< are books that have several scenes like this that I love. TIA
