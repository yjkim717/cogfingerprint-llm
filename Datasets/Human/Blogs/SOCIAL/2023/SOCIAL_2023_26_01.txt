I have worked at this place for 3 years now and have suffered every single day. I don't know if I'm being dramatic but I felt like my brain could not keep up with how many things we had to do, so I would sometimes I would get behind on due dates or just forget some things. Last week I was told they're looking for my replacement. They haven't found anyone so it's just a heads up for me to start looking but it sucks.
