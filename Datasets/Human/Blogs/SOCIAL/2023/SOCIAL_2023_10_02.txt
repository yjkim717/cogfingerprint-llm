Just to learn rshiny, I made a budgeting app and an exercise log app, both of which require a data frame to be updated and maintained. I can run it locally, but I would like to be able to run it from my phone while I am out. shinyapps.io seems to only allow me to upload a static app or at least not store and update my dataframes. Are there any good, preferably free or cheap options? Any help is appreciated, thanks.
