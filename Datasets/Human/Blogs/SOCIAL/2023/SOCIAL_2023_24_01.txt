This is kind of a response to the post with the opposite claim but was also something that bothered me before. There already are millions of diseases that are deadly to different species and the risk of a Zoonosis, meaning that it becomes a risk to humans as well, is ever present. Adding another disease to the mix doesn't change the risk calculus at all. Especially considering how different the terrormorph's biology is from our own. Another important factor is that humans seem to have mastered disease in the starfield universe. The aid items cure so many different ailments instantly and doctors are able to fix you in any situation. The real danger of releasing a microbe like that is to disrupt existing ecosystems. But in this case that's the intended effect. Introducing the terrormorph's apex predator into the wild again on the other hand would not drive them to extinction due to the predator-prey cycle. Most likely both populations would oscillate around a stable level and coexist. The same way that foxes didn't drive rabbits to extinction, because the foxes would die out too. Only the microbe makes sense. And the dangers and not really relevant.
