In the land of data structures, where many forms do dwell, There's one that stands out brightly, with a story to tell. Its name is Hashtable, and it's a curious thing, With speed and efficiency that makes programmers sing. Now listen, my friend, and I'll tell you the tale, Of how Hashtables work, in every detail. With keys and values, they store information, To help you retrieve it, with great jubilation. An array is the backbone, but it isn't enough, A clever trick, makes the Hashtable tough. A special function, called hash, you see, Takes a key as input, and gives an index with glee. The hash function's magic, is to change the key, Into a number, an index, just as quick as can be. With this index in hand, the Hashtable is fast, To store and retrieve, the data that's asked. But alas, my dear friend, there's a challenge to face, When two keys collide, they must share the same space. This problem we call, a hash collision, To solve it we use, a technique with precision. Two methods stand out, to resolve this plight, Separate chaining and open addressing, to set things right. With separate chaining, a linked list we use, When keys collide, we just append, no space to lose. But open addressing, takes a different approach, When keys collide, it searches for an empty spot like a coach. Linear probing, quadratic, or double hashing, it tries, Until an open spot it finds, or until it sighs. So now you know, the story of Hashtable, the great, A data structure that's loved, and seldom met with hate. With clever hash functions, and collision resolution, The Hashtable stands proud, in data structure evolution.
