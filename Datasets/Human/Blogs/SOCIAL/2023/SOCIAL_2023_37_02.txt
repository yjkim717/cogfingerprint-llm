Late Modern is usually considered to be the period roughly aligning from 1800 to the end of WWII. What are your favourite Fantasy's set in this period? A favorite of mine is Temeraire, a series which depicts the Napoleonic wars with Dragons involved. I feel Carnival row also counts. It is not set in our world, but the technology roughly aligns to our early modern era.
