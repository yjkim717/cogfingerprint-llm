I have been playing the piano for about eight years but my teachers always put little to no emphasis on music theory and I would really like to know more. Whenever i ask though, everyone is reluctant to teach me even the basics. I might consider attending the conservatory in a few years and i would like to get a better idea of what this stuff is about before then. So if you could recommend me some books id really appreciate that!
