My nan died recently, she had cash assets that will cover the cost of a funeral. Now the issue is that she had a joint bank account with my grandad, once her death is reported to them it becomes a sole account for my grandad and he would need to pay it instead of claiming from the bank like normal. They told me they would not pay a funeral invoice due to this. He has very late developed dementia and alzheimers. He cant remember the planet hes on, he has no capacity to make any financial decisions, he isnt even capable of deciding jf he wants to have a glass of water, and we have no way of accessing these funds. His finances were managed by ny nan, this was all sudden and there was no way of knowing so nothing else was put in place. I dont think he has a deputy and has been in the hospital for over a year. Is there any way we are able to use the money in his account to cover the funeral costs, i dont want to arrange something just to be billed and they wont cover it. Its something i cant afford and frankly dont feek comfortable paying for. Im not sure if it matters but we do know that my nan had a text saying her bank account was blocked and never managed to call to unblock it. I just need help, who do i speak to, who can approve this? I dont even think we would qualify for a public health funeral . , i dont even know how to arrange a funeral, ive never been to one, its on me. My mother is in full time care due to a stroke, paralyzed, but retains full capacity. I feel like my mind is melting and everyone is fanning the flame
