So I have been thinking about trying to make some broth (don’t know the exact name in English) by cooking it for a long time and tried to check what kind of pot I should use. Now, having paid attention in physics class I would’ve thought I’d have to find myself a very tall, slim pot to reduce the surface area and evaporation so I will be left with more liquid after 15-20hours of simmering. But now having looked für some input online, I found several sources saying that you’d rather use a wide pot to use for stock/broth… So now I’m wondering…. Is my physics knowledge rusty or am I just thinking wrong here and you would want a lot of evaporation? Looking forward to your input :)
