I always get woken up by the mutt next door. I've tried combinations of good earplugs, a Lectrofan white noise machine (which doesn't help unless it's on max volume but then it's really hard to sleep), and noise-cancelling headphones, but the barking still cuts through and wakes me up (sounds like it's in the same room). Plus it goes on and off all morning so I can't drift back to sleep. And yeah I've already gone through the whole talking to neighbors 100 times ritual (went as you would expect) and the authorities aren't helpful. I'm still trying, but I really need to fucking sleep in the meantime. I would greatly appreciate your suggestions for sleepable yet loud bark-drowning solutions.
