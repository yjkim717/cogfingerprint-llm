Hi all, Really hoping no one gets mad at me for asking. My ob offered the generic carrier screening. We weren't sure what do to so we asked to get back to her. Thinking about it more, I feel like the results will worry me. Husband and I are young and both healthy will no known family history of any of the over 500 genetic disorders that the carrier screen tests for, but I have a health related anxiety condition which is why I think the results could worry me.
