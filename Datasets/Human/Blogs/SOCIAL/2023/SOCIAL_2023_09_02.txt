Not counting TOS, I feel the Klingons have always stood at least 6 inches taller than most humans. The actors would sometimes wear platform-like boots to amp up the height. In Ep 1 of S2 it seemed like the Klingons were shorter now and spoke without the Klingon growl and snarl. They just sounded like humans mostly. Am I the only one that noticed this?
