Whenever someone asks a question like “am I the only one who thinks The Shawshank Redemption is overrated?” People have a tendency to say things like “what a silly question? Obviously you’re not the ONLY person in the world to not like Shawshank.” I personally don’t think there’s anything wrong with phrasing a question like that. It’s a figure of speech that isn’t meant to literally imply the user thinks they’re the only person in the world who feels this way, and taking it in literal terms is silly when you clearly know what it means.
