I have a hairline fracture on my patella, but itâ€™s day 4 and I have almost full range of motion with minor pain if I move it slowly. Still tender and painful when moving quickly, but I can remain seated upright with a 90 degree bend no problem if I ease into it. Do I still need to keep it straight?
