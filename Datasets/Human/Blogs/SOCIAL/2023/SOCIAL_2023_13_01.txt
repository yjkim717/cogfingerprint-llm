Posting here because the Dallas sub is dead. Just moved to the area. We've tried 3 or 4 so far. Pros would be: Intergenerational or at least some young people Option for small groups Nursery or nursing room AWANA Non-denominational, Baptist, Evangelical (open to others) About 1 hour No LDS, Catholic, thank you. Does not need to have all of the pros, just things we would look for.
