For instance when it comes to Chinese, Korean, and Japanese they may sound similar. But there are differences that can be recognized by ear without understanding the words. Chinese tends to be very tonal, with variations in the inflexions on words. Japanese has pretty recognizable endings to words such as ni, shtah, Chan etc Korean by way of elimination doesn't use honorifics like Japanese does. So if you don't hear any, then you can safly bet that it's a Korean language being spoken. With all that being said, is there anything like to easily distinguish between the slavic languages without being an expert?
