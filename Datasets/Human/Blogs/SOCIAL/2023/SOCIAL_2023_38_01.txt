Okay, just wanted to throw this out there: We need to be more willing to watch TFM content for the purpose of documentation. I feel like just posting screenshots comments from Randos means we're kind of giving them license to move their goalposts without anyone calling them out on it. The most hilarious example of this is Doomcock. The guy is obviously full of shit, and I'm glad there are a series of videos documenting every claim he's ever made that's been proven false. It's good that there's someone out there calling bullshit on him to any of his followers who are willing to hear it. Here's the thing, though: the person documenting Doomcock's bullshit is Knights of Melvin! If the best cop on the beat monitoring TFM is another member of TFM, then why do we even have this sub?
