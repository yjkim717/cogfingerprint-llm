Ok so I've been wondering how does hrt effect someone skinny. So little rundown I'm trans but also have been really skinny my whole life due to an insanely high metabolism, so how is hrt going to effect me? Is it possible that I may just not get any feminine curviness from fat redistribution? Can it repel my metabolism in order to gain weight? Do these 2 things even correlate to each other at all?
