Hey all! I am brainstorming options for a new desk on a budget that also has storage capability. I keep seeing IKEAâ€™s Alex cabinet/drawer units. I like the concept of using them to support a desk top and for storage. But the price is a bit much considering my plans (considering multiple units). Does Menards have anything similar to the Alex units?
