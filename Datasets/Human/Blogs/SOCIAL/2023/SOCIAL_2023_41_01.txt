So I have 2c-3a low porosity hair (I think lol) and I usually style it using an overnight method for waves (i twist sections of it around a silky cloth to create the curls) and I have been doing it for about a year. I dont know if I damaged my curl pattern this way (?) but recently i have been wanting to change to styling my hair with some products so I have bought minis of the Curlsmith hold me softly style balm and hydro flexi jelly to try them out. Basically what I do is shampoo my hair, twist it to get the water out, put on conditioner on the ends and start detangling and combing the hair. Then I rinse the conditioner off and part my hair, apply the hold me softly style balm (about a quarter sized amount maybe?) and scunch and squish the hair upwards. Then I go in with the same amount of the flexi jelly and do the same and dry my hair with the diffuser attachment with my head upside down. Problem is my hair gets super poofy the day after and has no definition so I must be doing something wrong. Doing the overnight styling method is not always super practical so I'd like to learn how to style my hair with product as well. If anyone has any tips on how to use these I'd be super grateful!
