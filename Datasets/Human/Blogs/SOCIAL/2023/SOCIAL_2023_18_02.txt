Is there any way of spicing up the fighting system? They thought the regular old security guards from the book were way too OP, and I don't really know if I should fudge the rolls to make it easier for them somehow, or if it's just the nature of the game to be that difficult. I think they're just used to DnD, where the combat system is super easy and the armor system is pretty straightforward.
