Hi, i took my car (2014 nissan rogue select AWD) into the shop for a front right CV axle replacement, originally i was told it was gonna be around $300-350, i called the guy this morning and he said its more difficult that he originally thought and the mechanic was sitting their chipping away at something with a pneumatic chisel....anyway he was saying then it was gonna cost around $700, that was two hours ago and every hour they are charging me around $100 in labor, how is this ok, i didnt get a call this morning i had to call him, isnt it customary to call someone and tell them hey this is gonna be allot more expensive and time consuming, honestly i would of bought a CV Axle off RockAuto and had my uncle help me, i didnt want to deal with the fluids and stuff at first and figured 300-350 was worth that cost, now im fucked, what can i do, this is getting out of hand.
