It may have happened in early-sound cinema as well, but the silents seem to have been where it peaked. Typically what will happen is this; an actor will get shot, fall to the ground, kick their legs in the air a few times rapidly, then lie dead. I’ve seen it predominately in westerns, but that may just be because they were the most popular genre at the time - certainly the most popular one were people regularly get shot. Regardless, it looks to have disappeared entirely after the silent era. I don’t recall ever seeing it in any sound westerns and that doesn’t seem to be the way getting shot goes in real life. My best guess would be they did it to put heavy emphasis on the death, without being able to use blood or audio. A lot of silents famously have incredibly theatrical and showy acting to compensate for the lack of dialogue, and maybe this is just one of the flourishes they added. Did I guess right? Was it something inherited from the stage or vaudeville? Was this an actual thing that happened when a musket ball lodged itself in your nervous system or something that just became forgotten/ignored as time got further away from that era?
