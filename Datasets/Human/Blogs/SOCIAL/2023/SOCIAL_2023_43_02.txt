39M and have has this for over 15 years but lately it's been getting increasingly worse. Doesn't matter what I eat (I've eliminated almost everything over the years), extremely healthy eater and weight lifter. Right after anything (protein shake, some air fryer chicken, rice, oatmeal, pizza, you name it), I will have anywhere from 30 seconds to no more than 3 min to find a bathroom before watery explosive diarrhea. I've almost been arrested having to go on the side of an intestate and have no dignity left. This happens 6-12 times a day at least. I don't have to go until it hits me like a truck. I've had stool samples evaluated (been abroad to a lot of countries so they checked for parasite/foreign cause), colonoscopy all clear and blood drawn all come back as if I'm healthy. This probably is irrelevant but I was also on 50-100mcg fentanyl patch for over 10 years for a failed back fusion syndrome before I detoxed off it around 3 years ago. Is this just something I have to live with the rest of my life or is there anything else that can be done? My life is extremely restricted. Thanks in advance.
