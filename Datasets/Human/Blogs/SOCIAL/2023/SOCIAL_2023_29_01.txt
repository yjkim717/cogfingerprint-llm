Got my hormone levels results today and I think I'm off to a great start being at E 299 for my first time. Unfortunately I could not find my T levels on the lab results summary, but I'm sure they are much lower aswell. As some bonus info I've expirenced a ton of desire effects including: drastic facial changes, breasts budding, change in odor of sweat and pee, a bit of thigh/hip fat redistribution, reduced libido and less elections, shrinkage of testicular volume, clearer skin, & suprising enough a growth of hairline consisting of newer baby hairs. I've been told by the people that surround me that they have watched me physically change and have seen an improvement in my confidence aswell as being more outspoken and comfortable with myself. Slowly but surely I am taking steps to feminize myself even more. The biggest in the last 3 months are I got my ears pierced, have started laser hair removal treatment, and plan to start dating very soon, which was all super scary at first but thrilling to find the courage to do. I'll keep updating down the line, that's all for now ✌️
