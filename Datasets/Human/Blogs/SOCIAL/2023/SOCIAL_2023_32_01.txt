Would it be difficult? Especially if you aren't wanting to harm yourself or anything like that? Can a PCP do it or would it need to be something like a therapist? Ive heard your PCP can either diagnose or give a referral. I have an extremely strong suspicion that I have some sort of depression and potentially several other things due to things in my childhood and past in general. Starting at things that happened during the summer before 6th grade (25 now). I remember completely not taking care of myself. Just totally stopping brushing my teeth for weeks on end, not showering for weeks or upwards of a month for reasons I can't explain. Wore the same clothes multiple days, mostly in the summer though. Lost interest in things like pokemon and swimming which I had been obsessed with and still go back and forth between being interested and stopping. Given anything I tried to ask others about in my real life ended negatively about either me lying or that others had it worse makes me feel it'd end up the same. That I'm just an impostor because I can get out of bed and act like I'm fine around others but get stuck in my head when I'm alone or go off into some fictious world while listening to music. Would an actual diagnosis change anything?
