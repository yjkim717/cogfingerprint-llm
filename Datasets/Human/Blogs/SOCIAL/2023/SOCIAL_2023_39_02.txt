I have no clue how to get a starter for this one. I thought maybe a leather whip, but zoologist is not unlockable Maybe Abigail's flower, the flower doesn't spawn on jungle grass Ok finch staff, no large trees Flinx staff, there's no cold biome I don't think I really want to do a summoner only playthrough but like, how do I start it. I ended up just going around catching a whole bunch of critters trying to get 10% on the bestiary and then fishing for an hour to get some armor. Any advice would be appreciated
