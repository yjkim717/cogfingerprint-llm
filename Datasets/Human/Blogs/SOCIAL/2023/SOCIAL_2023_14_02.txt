Info: 26F, diagnosed with PCOS, Visual Snow Syndrome and ADHD. Currently taking Ritalin. Average 1-2 drinks a week, no drug use or tobacco use. I have been bleeding consistently since October. Sometimes very heavily, sometimes lighter but always way more than usual spotting. I’m also passing thick jelly like clots consistently. It’s like my period started in October and just hasn’t stopped yet. As well as this, constant severe period pain and cramping is always cropping up (to the point where it is happening up to 2-3 times in a week where standing is a major struggle). Period pain relief medications do nothing for this. Today’s flow is heavy to the point where I’ve gone through 2 tampons in the past 3 hours, and I’m getting severely concerned- I have asked about this in the past to this sub but have been reassured it’s normal for PCOS, but now I am really worried- how concerned should I be and how urgent should any action I take be? This is affecting my work life, my personal life and every aspect of my social life and I’m sick of being in constant pain. Thanks!
