27F with Anxiety. Medication: Roaccutane (Accutane) Every time try to make a habit of going to the gym I always get "sick". Right now my head hurts and my throat feels weird. It doesn't exactly hurt but the sides feel swollen(?). Im guessing this is probably just the flu or something but im just curious... I've always struggled with drinking enough water, what are the chances of this just being me being dehydrated ?
