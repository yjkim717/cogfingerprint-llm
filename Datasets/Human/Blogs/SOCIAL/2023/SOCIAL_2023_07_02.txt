since every post in this sub is basically about people asking current stock questions, i figured a discussion post would be nice! what is the absolute best thing that you would buy religiously that is now discontinued? for me its the Mediterranean pasta salad from the deli or the balderson 1 year aged cheddar slices. the pasta salad would last me 3 days for lunch (i work there so I'd just leave it in the work fridge! so easy!) and the cheese was the absolute BEST!! they only have the aged yellow cheddar bricks from balderson, and 2 year + aged cheddar in bricks as well. the 1 year was the best and im so bummed we dont sell it anymore ☹️ what about yours?!
