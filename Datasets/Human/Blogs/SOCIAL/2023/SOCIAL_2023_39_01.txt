So I'm like 80% sure this is wrong but it came to mind. Why do the Pikmin follow olimar? It's been assumed that they just kinda love him for birthing them but what if Pikmin have a king or queen that they normally have to pluck them that looks like olimar. Basically I don't think olimar is dead in the fourth game. As we've seen in the first game the sprout the onion makes has a brown stalk and very kopait features including difrent skin but also physical features like smooth skin and ears. I do think it would be weird to suddenly show a king of Pikmin but it would answer the two questions of "why do the Pikmin follow olimar unwavering (even to death)" and "how did they even develop as a species and survive withought olimar?" What do y'all think, just something I thought I'd share.
