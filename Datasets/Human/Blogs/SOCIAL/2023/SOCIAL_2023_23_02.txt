Now that I’ve had top surgery (and started a new job) I’ve decided that for my own peace of mind as well as safety I would be stealth in the workplace. This has definitely been a good decision (a coworker has said some really yikes things about gnc presentation) and no one has clocked me but I feel fake. It feels like, even if no one has gotten my pronouns wrong or anything that they *know* I’m not cis. While I’m sure it’s 100% in my head I just wanted to know if other people had ever gone through feeling in a similar way and if you had any advice.
