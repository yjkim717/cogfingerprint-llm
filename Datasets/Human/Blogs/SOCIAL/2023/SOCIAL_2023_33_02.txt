I’m trying to get all of the trophy’s and I’m having trouble with the one for surviving a bounty. I know I have to survive for 48 minutes but I’ve tried so many things, I’ve tried hiding on high buildings/mountains. I’ve tried driving/flying away from players. I’ve tried hiding far in the ocean and I just recently tried hiding in the tunnels, nothing works. I always get tracked down and killed by other players. Is there any easy way to do this ? I’m a lower level and I don’t have much money for things so I can’t buy much
