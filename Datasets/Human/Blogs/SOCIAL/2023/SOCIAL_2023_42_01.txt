I was watching Star Trek TNG. In one episode, counselor Troy takes the bridge officer test. When she passes and she's doing brige duty, she tells Data to call her Sir. And all I can think was, 300 years in the future and a woman still cannot have authority unless she styles herself as a man. What next will they make her wear a little beard too. And watching Castle. The new captain, a woman took offense to being called ma'am and said she is to be addressed as Capian or Sir. It just annoys me so much. She is a ma'am. It feels like an insult to every woman who was denied a leadership position just because she was a woman to call a woman leader Sir.
