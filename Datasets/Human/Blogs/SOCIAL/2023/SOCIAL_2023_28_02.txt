So I am, a senior who’s in high school. I didn’t go to school today because all my classes are done so I will just be is sitting on my ass. So I decided to skip school and go to work. And then I have an appointment at 2 o’clock so I would be excused for that day so I asked my dad not to tell my brother because my brother would get violent and yell at me for it then my brother literally said I’m gonna kick your ass when you get home, and then I said to my dad I do not want you talking to me and you can go to hell and then I told my sister what happened and she said I took it too far. So I am asking for advice on whether took it too far. By telling him to go to hell and is this a bad situation to be in. And is there a way for me to call the cops if he actually meant that threat and did get violent.
