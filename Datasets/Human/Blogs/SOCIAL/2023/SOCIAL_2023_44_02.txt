Whatever "non-traditional" means to you. Futuristic, different time period, etc. For me it would have to be the Opera San Jose production of Marriage of Figaro set in 1890s India during the British Raj. Visually stunning, and the setting not only worked but drove home Beaumarchais's points from the original play all the more.
