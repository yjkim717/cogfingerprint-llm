I think around 2018 or 2019 Stripes was purchased from Susser by 7-11 corporation. I remember that the people that worked there were super friendly and the stores were always being cleaned. The pumps seemed to always be operating and were also kept clean. Laredo Taco would open early for breakfast and close in the afternoon after lunch time. Then the folks would spend quite a long time getting everything cleaned up. Flash forward to 2023 Cashiers often won't even make eye contact with you at the counter, many of the employees are dressed like slobs. Recently I've seen a few employees that are working there in their street clothes without a uniform. And the stores are very dirty now, the floors and sidewalks are disgusting, heck the sidewalks are so dirty that you can feel the grease sticking to your shoes in the summer heat. The windows are covered in layers of dirt and filth. The pumps are gross and uncleaned, there are thick layers of oil and grease where you park by the pumps. Everything is grimey and gray. Even newer locations like the Stripes on 37@McKinzie is already filthy. Laredo Taco is now open all day. The food sits in the steamers for hours with flies buzzing around. It looks disgusting. Plus since they are open all day I'm guessing they don't spend as much time cleaning the equipment as they used to. When you look at a company like Buckees which prides itself on having clean and friendly locations and then you look at what 7-11 has given us and compare it to what we used to have it's really sad. I'm not one to complain about things too much, but this doesn't seem like an isolated situation as I've been in quite a few different Stripes locations in different towns and they all are gross. I hope things change soon, but who am I kidding, Stipes owns 80% of the gas stations around here. Why do anything?
