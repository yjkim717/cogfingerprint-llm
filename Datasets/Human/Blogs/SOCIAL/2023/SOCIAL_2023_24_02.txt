I started playing Deathloop three weeks ago and since it has become one of my all time favorite games. I was extremely sceptical at first, as I like to save-scum and normally don't like repeating a location but after really enjoying prey I decided to give it a chance and oh boy was it worth it! The world and the mechanics are so incredibly well connected, the atmosphere and visuals are awesome, the voice acting is on point, the setting is unique and everything has a very distinct vibe to it. Everything fits together so satisfyingly and the game gives the player so many options to tackle a problem that I'm still discovering new and fully fleshed out mechanics. My only 'problem' with the game (besides PvP rubberbanding) is that I can't play it for the first time again. I wish there were even more weapons, trinkets, secrets and locations. I really hope Arkane is going to release DLCs and a sequel at some point. I know the game wasn't a big commercial success but maybe it will become more popular as time goes on. I want to explore a world like this again!
