So I just finished my first playthrough and compared to my husbands two endings so far mine was pretty good: Illithids are all gone, no more tadpoles. During the second to last cutscene it had Astarion running away bc sun and Karlach and Wyll go to Avernus because her engine is giving up. 6 months pass and withers organizes a nice reunion dinner that also included a bunch of kind words(letters) from people we helped. \-Gale and I live happily in Waterdeep where he is an academic and no longer has the bomb as Mystra disable/removed it. \-Tara is sassy lol but talks to withers a lot. \-Halsin has the now non-shadow cursed lands thriving with rich harvests and harmony. And is basically a dad/care taker for a bunch of kids and Thaniel and Oliver are so happy about that. Hes also taking in the armoured owlbear. \-Shadowheart is happy wandering and being apart of Selune temple. \-Astarion is also happy being an adventurer of sorts. "It turns out no one actually cares about murder, so long as you murder the right people. And apparently I'm rather good at it." \-Volo is Volo and just using our story to become famous but whatever lol \-Wyll and Karlach are doing their best in Avernus, seemingly in love as well. They found blueprints that could help fix or remake Karlachs engine to leave Avernus forever. Starting a new run now, not truly dark urge but Ill try to be more idk rude? lol and break some more hearts. &#x200B; What a great game.
