I am going on my second date with her. I paid for the 1st date, and took her out to lunch on 2 other occasions (we work together). The second time I asked her to lunch she explained she didn't want me to keep spending money on her. That's fair, I understand that. But now our actual date is coming up, and I want to say to her "I am more than willing to pay for this date, but I feel it would be disrespectful of me to pay without asking how you feel". I offered to take her to the movie for the date, but I don't want to ignore the boundaries.
