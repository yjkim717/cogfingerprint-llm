I've had both hard-core Capitalists and hard-core Socialists scream at me online about this, so figured I'd throw it up here. Listen to someone who defines themselves as a "Capitalist" describe what "Capitalism" and "Socialism" are. Now do the same thing with a person who defines themselves as a "Socialist." Does it sound like they're remotely talking about the same things? In particular, I've noticed that they both tend to insist that the State is a tool of the system they don't like. Since words ultimately only have meaning if we agree that they do, people using words to mean totally different things means that they either have no definition, or at least have multiple definitions. I don't say this as a good thing, just a fact of life. Pretty much any debate of "Capitalism" vs "Socialism" that doesn't start with both parties agreeing to shared definitions will inevitably turn into the two sides arguing for and against totally different things.
