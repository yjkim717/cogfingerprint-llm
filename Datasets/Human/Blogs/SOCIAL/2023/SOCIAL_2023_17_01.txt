I’m a 21 year old female. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, and depression on and off since I was about 13. My mood had been a lot better for several years until recently. I’m going through a messy situationship (we broke up, got back together, it’s casual, etc it’s a mess) with someone who does not treat me well, objectively; he calls me names, puts me down, ignores me, etc. and it’s combined with other things in my life (college graduation and getting ready to move) to result in the worst depressive episode I’ve ever experienced. I can’t eat. I can barely drink. I can’t get out of bed. My doctor prescribed me Effexor (which is what I took in the past) but I’m afraid to start it because I’m afraid of getting worse. I do see a therapist as well. I guess what I’m looking for is some hope. Someone who’s been in my position who got better eventually. It feels impossible right now. Thank you.
