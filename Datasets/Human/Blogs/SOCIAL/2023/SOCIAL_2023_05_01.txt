I just started my new job a little less than 2 months ago. I requested a laptop as I travel between my current state and home state quite frequently. My last WFH job in the same industry (Mortgage) at a smaller company gave me a laptop no problem, but I was told from my boss that if I plan on traveling my only options are PTO or working at a corporate office in the area I’m traveling in “for the time being” Is there legitimate reasons for this? Or did I likely ask for this benefit a bit too early into my job?
