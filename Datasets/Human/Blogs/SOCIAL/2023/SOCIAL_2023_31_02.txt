Is it normal to remember a good hook up and want to do it again even though I (24) am in a relationship? Me and my BF are attracted to each other etc. I would never cheat or act on anything like that. Just is on my mind sometimes. Don't care enough at the same time to do anything about it (like open relationship or sth). I don't like the hook up guy in any way, just his dick and what and how we did it. Just a good FWB I guess. Its been a few years since I ever saw the hook up.
