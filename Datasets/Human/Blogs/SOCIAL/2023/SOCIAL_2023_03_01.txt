Picking my 2-year-old up yesterday from preschool I was able to bear witness to a mom flipping her s*** on a couple of the teachers because they had been writing her child's name down with a capital A as the first letter...like you're supposed to do in the English language for proper nouns. Apparently not though as the woman began scream\wailing at one point "IT'S SPELLED WITH A LOWER CASE A!!" Unfortunately the stupidity of the whole argument was too overwhelming and the teachers and I were left speechless after the mom left. I'm still in a bit of a daze from the whole thing ,my faith in humanity is shaken, truly we have strayed far from His light.
