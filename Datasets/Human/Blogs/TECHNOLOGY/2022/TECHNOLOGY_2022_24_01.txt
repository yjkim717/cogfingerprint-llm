For years, I haven't seem to figure out what kind of hairstyle would suit me. I don't even know what to ask my barber. I go QB house or Okinawa and I honestly don't even know what to say. I've been using the "high slope, number 1 side, side part" for years and it just doesn't seem to fit me. Now, I'm just growing my hair out and honestly just stuck on what to do it. Any tips from the more stylish men out here?
