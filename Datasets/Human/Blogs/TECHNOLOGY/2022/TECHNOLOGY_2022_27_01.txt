Only reason I ask is because I trust the people on this sub a lot more than the main sub haha Edit to share thoughts: it's disappointing, it seems like TAZ takes itself too seriously. Balance was good because it was all a big joke, and then became something pretty cool. Amnesty tried to jump in the deep end, and they've recognized why that went wrong. Grad was a mess. I was hopeful Ethersea was the one they got right again, but I guess not.
