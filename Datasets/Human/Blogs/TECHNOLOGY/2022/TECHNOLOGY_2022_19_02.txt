A bit of backstory. I grew up with a control freak of her mum (Her words not mine) so she was constantly trying to interject and control things when i brought them up (Her way of dealing with her anxiety i guess). The consequence of that is that i am now FIRECLY independent; i want to do everything myself and if i need help i will ask for it. I don't want other people just butting in Anyway as i get closer to my move in date my girlfriend is starting to look at furniture etc. she often goes with her mum and her mum will often interject with things like "If you need help with x & y i know someone". This gets on my nerves A LOT because it sends me right back into when i was a kid and my mom would try and control me I want to do things myself, and if i fail i want to fail so i can learn, i don't want someone doing it for me; i feel useless if someone does that when realistically i could do it myself (Like laying down a lawn or putting up a wardrobe, that kinda stuff) I'm aware that her mum isn't being malicious with this she is just offering to help because that's what people usually do and that it comes from a place of care and 'love'. However every time she does i get very defensive and want to put my foot down and basically shout at her to stop trying to pry into my and my girlfriends life, if we need her help we'll ask Now i'm aware that is not the best way of handling the situation (Someone extending an olive branch and i just take out a Howitzer and shot it). But i legit don't know how to convey my point that doesn't wind up on one or more people being offended or flat out taken aback and basically give me to cold shoulder
