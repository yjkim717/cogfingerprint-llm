From my eyes most of social interaction are meaningless or futile because I do not understand "why". By the way, People say about me I am cold hearted, always sceptical, not really affected by someone else and so on. People say I'm thinking too much sometimes they say I have autistic behavior. How to improve myself to be more social?
