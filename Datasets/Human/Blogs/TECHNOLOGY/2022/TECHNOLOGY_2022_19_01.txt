This seems to be most prevlant in my hobbies were im on display as it were. Namely guitar and dancing Im always comparing myself to others i use it as my yard stick. I look all the dancers that are better than me and telling myself what is the point of dancing with her i cant add anything to what the previous dancer did People are telling me that i can never be "the best" its an unachievable goal. Thing is i take that as a challenge and a overwhelming desire to prove them wrong festers in me When dancing you want a fantastic dance with great technique and moves. To do it for anything else other than that seems pointless to me, why half arse it when you can own it
