I guess my problem is that I rush into things all the time and I have a hard time sometimes. I work IT and I've been noted by my peers for being above average but also someone who rushes into things with the mentality to get things done, IE quantity over quality. I'm well liked and everything but, I've gotten in trouble for it a lot and I'm not sure what to do. It really bothers me because I feel like it shouldn't be like this and I don't even know where to begin. I know it's a problem and I need to solve it but I feel like it's something I forget very easily during the day and I wind up reflecting back on my day and realizing how bad it was and where I needed to slow down and focus. I can never remember it when I need it. I don't see anyone other than my GP and an Endocronolgist for my Diabetes. I have asked my doctor before and she said she'd want to talk to me about it befor making a referral.
