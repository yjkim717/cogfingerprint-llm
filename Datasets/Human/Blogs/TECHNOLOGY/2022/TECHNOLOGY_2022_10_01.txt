I’m curious if any of you guys have specific players you’d like to see targeted. For me, if one of Boeser or Garland is dealt, I’d love if they could do a deal purely for futures and then go after Burakovsky in FA. He keeps putting up better numbers every year and doesn’t spend much time with Mackinnon. He also would probably command around 7x7 on the open market. I personally would rather pay 1-2m extra to have him replace Boeser or Garland, plus we’d also acquire whatever futures we can for trading one of those guys. Another guy I’m interested in is Braden Schneider (dead horse I know). I think he’s the perfect partner for Hughes long term.
