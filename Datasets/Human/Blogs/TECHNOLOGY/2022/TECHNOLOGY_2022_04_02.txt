I'm new to smoking shisha. I'm wondering what is the best way to buy flavours in the UK. UK based websites have overpriced flavours, I'm guessing that it's because they're resellers. Stores in the UK are also overpriced unless it's Al Fakher. I don't want to limit myself to one brand though. It seems US websites have the best prices, literally 3 times cheaper. Although the shipping fee is usually $50. Even so, does anyone order from US? And does anyone know what the limit is to how much tobacco you can order at once from US to UK? I was thinking the most cost efficient way to get good flavours would be to order a bunch of them at once from a US website and use a shipping service to send it to a US temporary address. Buy my own label, and get it shipped from there to UK for a much lower shipping fee than what the website would offer. But how do you guys get your flavours? Specifically brands other than Al Fakher.
