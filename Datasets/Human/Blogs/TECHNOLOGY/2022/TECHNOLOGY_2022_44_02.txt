I have to do some travelling for business reasons and I'm wondering if there's anyway to gain a financial benefit here. Does anyone have experience or tricks to this? A good example, from what I've gathered is. Use a cash back credit card for spending. The costs covered by work, pay the credit card and the cash back I get to keep. Any other opportunities here?
