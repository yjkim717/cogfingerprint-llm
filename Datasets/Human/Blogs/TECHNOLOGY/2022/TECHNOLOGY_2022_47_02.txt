So I made it through two of three rounds of interviews, last one is tomorrow afternoon and the timeframe was stated to be between 2.5 and 4 hrs in length with interviews with five people in total. This is my first admin position if I get it but, this seems a bit excessive to me. I'm not sure if it's me or not.
