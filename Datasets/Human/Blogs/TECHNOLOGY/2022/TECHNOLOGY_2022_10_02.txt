I found a local music shop that has a brand new in-box pod xt for sale and I want to buy it for the big bottom amp sim because my favourite band uses it (as far as I know anyway). I called my regional line 6 distributor just to double check that the Pod xt will still work and everything, given that it's been discontinued for so long. He said I would need a software called "Line 6 monkey" to connect the pod xt to my computer and make updates (including installing the metal shop pack which contains the big bottom amp). However, it appears that monkey is only supported up to Mac OS 10.14. We're way past 10.14 now. For those of you who have a pod xt, do you just have an older computer? Or do you never update the pod xt anymore? Is there some sort of workaround? Update for anyone who reads this in the future: I bought the podxt and tried to use a virtual machine running windows 10 to install the metal shop pack but there were issues updating the drivers for monkey. I had to actually find someone with a legit windows 10 computer. After the installation it works great!
