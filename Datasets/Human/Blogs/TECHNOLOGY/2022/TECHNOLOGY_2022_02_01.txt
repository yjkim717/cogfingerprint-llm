Hey guys, I’ve had an iPhone 11 and 12 ( on T-Mobile and Verizon, respectively ) and both had this “special voicemail” that I really liked. It reminded Me if Google voice, but integrated into the phone app. In the phone app, under voicemail tab, I could play, delete, and read voicemails transcripts. A couple days ago I got an iPhone 13 on Verizon but my voicemail tab only has the option to call my voicemail box. Any ideas??
