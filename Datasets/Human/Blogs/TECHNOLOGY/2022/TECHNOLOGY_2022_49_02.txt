I only have a picture of my vaccination card, and I am traveling through Spirit airlines to Medellin, Colombia from Boston, Massachusetts (Fort Lauderdale airport in between). Will just a picture from my phone pass? I could print it if need be as well. I'm traveling on Wednesday March 30 and coming back April 3.
