my 6yo son added a bunch of friends to minecraft and now they enter his creative worlds and blow them up and it's upsetting him. i don't want to disable all players from joining because his siblings are friends and they play together. i tried googling how to remove friends but couldn't find an answer. he's using the windows 10 edition if that matters thanks.
