I live on the south side, and have to park in front of my house. My neighbors to the left have recently decided to start parking their vehicles in front of my place along with mine, forcing me to now park further down the street. I've tried asking them to not park in front of my house but that hasn't worked as of yet. I know parking on the street is fair game, but does anyone have any suggestions/tips for my situation?
