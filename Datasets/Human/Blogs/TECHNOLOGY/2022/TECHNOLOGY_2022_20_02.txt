Tried to use askdocs but having no luck with responses and I’m really getting worse. Previous Context: I just recently went into the ER after MONTHS of battling whatever seems to be knocking me down with headache issues, fatigue and tingling. I was told via CT scan that my 3rd and Lateral ventricles were prominent, that I might have hydrocephalus and may need to have an MRI with contrast done. I’m worried, my head feels like it’s going to explode and I’m going in and out of lightheadedness and control of my eyes. The next appointment with my PCP is Monday, but to be prepared I called around neuros in network and they’re out until late January. Do you guys think I should be concerned for seizures, brain damage, or any other major issues while it could possibly get worse in that time? Thanks in advance. New Info: My face, arms and hands are tingling a lot, I’m abnormally confused a bit more often about things, I’m having severe head PRESSURE/headaches whenever i am not laying flat on my back, severe anxiety about dying in my sleep so I cannot sleep at night anymore, and chest pain. I really really need guidance. I’m really worried.
