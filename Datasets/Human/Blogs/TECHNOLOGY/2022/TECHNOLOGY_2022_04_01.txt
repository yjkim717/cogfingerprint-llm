I got jumped in my ends couple of months ago by some yutes I never seen in my life. I don't associate with anyone from my block anyway. Yesterday I saw a video of a school yute explaining how he got g-checked and rushed by olders for no reason. Real talk tho, why the fuck is g checking man you don't know not considered pathetic as fuck. It should be embarrassing for these man to be doing this shit to people they don't know just cause they black or got a tracksuit on. What sort of dumb shit is that let's be forreal. Anyone that g-checks or even just asks "where you from" to a yute they don't know is straight pussy. Like go g-check your opps not civs and yutes you don't know ðŸ˜‚ I know it already is considered pathetic from the outside, but I really don't get why the energy ain't the same within the hood.
