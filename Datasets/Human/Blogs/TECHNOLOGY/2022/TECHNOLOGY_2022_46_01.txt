Per suggestion from a couple folks over there, posting this here: I've worked in IT for over 20 years now, and I've been meaning to put together a guide for people who've never worked in the industry, as something like "how to enter the IT field." I have a few bright, capable, hard working friends who are woefully underemployed and who have expressed an interest in getting into the field, and given how much smarter and harder working they are by comparison to a LOT of IT people I have worked with in the past (and a few I currently work with), I thought it would be helpful to put a guide together for "how to get into IT." Problem is, while I've done plenty of internal documentation for the companies I've worked for, I've never written about something like this, and I'm not entirely sure how to go about doing this. Not saying this is the "only" way or even the "best" way. What follows is just what worked for me, and I'm hoping it'll work for others as well. Please feel free to throw out your own thoughts/suggestions/feedback. About me: I have spent 21 years in IT, with 14 of that in the hotel industry (Holiday Inn, Westin, Montage), where I was an IT generalist/manager; help desk, projects, servers, virtualization, storage, networks, wireless, etc. The last 7 years have been a bit less generalized (health care field; a SaaS company for three and a half years, and recently a global MLM company) but adding backups, email, & cloud technologies as well. Including some comments from the original post.
