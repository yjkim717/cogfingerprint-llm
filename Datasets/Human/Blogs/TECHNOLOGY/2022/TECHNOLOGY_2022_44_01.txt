So we purchased a dog on Sunday, and we were told its 3m old. We asked if its been vaccinated etc and they replied, they don't need it. We took it to the vets today, to find it has two microchips. One is blank and one is registered to another person. The dogs age is 6m old as well. I reached out to the seller who wouldn't provide answers, so what can I do to report this seller. I have obviously lost a substantial amount of money here if the registered owner wants it back. I have all the evidence of what has happened and simply want the seller to be investigated, but who do I report this to?
