Other than negotiating your offer, I am curious if high paying jobs are more work, stress, and working hours than lower paying jobs. For example, my current job pays TC 168k and I feel it takes up 9 hours a day, and I still feel like I need more time to study all the important concepts and skim through all the important information. My first 2 job offers had paid 45k and 69k and there was a lot of time spent waiting and not as much information to consume (though the culture wasnâ€™t as great in the 2nd one). Any thoughts or experience on this? I am asking because I would like to be happier even if it meant I earned less.
