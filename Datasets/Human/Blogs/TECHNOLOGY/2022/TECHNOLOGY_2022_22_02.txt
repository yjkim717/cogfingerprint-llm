I can't remove this screw. I've done everything from vice grips, to hammer, to wrenches now to speed out. Nothing breaks this bolt and I can't remove and replace the spring bush as a result. Not only has this part broken after 3 months of use, it's seemingly next to impossible to replace with the parts they shipped me. I'm at my wit's end at this point. This is the worst $1820.00 investment I've made in a while. Does anyone have any suggestions before I just give up and demand a new machine?
