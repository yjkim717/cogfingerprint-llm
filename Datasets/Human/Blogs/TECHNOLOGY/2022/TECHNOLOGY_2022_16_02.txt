Hi, I want to use a psn code for topping up the credit balance/add games. My account is Italian( I am from there) but I know live in the UK. What does PSN check in order to decide if I can use a PSN code? Where my account is from?(address), where I currently live?(IP) or both? I would like to know If I need to buy Italian or UK codes (or just europeans) Thanks
