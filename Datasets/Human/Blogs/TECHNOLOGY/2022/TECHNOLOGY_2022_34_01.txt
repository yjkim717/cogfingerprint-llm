The only differences I could tell between the 400P and 400P-RV were: * Extension Air Hose * 45-Degree Extended Reach Chuck (For Dual Rear Wheels) * 90-Degree Twist-On Chuck Price: * 400P(Automatic Function) - $299.95 * 400P-RV - $369.95 I drive a 2013 F250 and pull a 284 BHS. Given I don't have dually I won't use the 45-degree extension. I probably won't even use the 90 degree either. 30ft will be pretty close to reaching my TT tires from the truck if my measurements are right. I should be able to connect it to the TT battery and easily reach I think. Worst case I buy another 25 feet of hose for $18.99
