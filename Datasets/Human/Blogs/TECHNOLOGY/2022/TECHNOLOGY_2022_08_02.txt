Hey guys, No matter how thick-skinned I try to be, each rejection hurts. I know it's a numbers game, but I'm starting to feel like even a LinkedIn Quick Apply isn't worth it when the rejection rolls in. If I invest in something and write a cover letter and apply properly, that hurts even more. But somehow even these form-rejections really get to me. I'm not strong enough to ignore them to preserve my humanity, I guess. I'm trying to play it cool, but it's still taking a toll. Do you guys have any self-care (ehhhhh, but yeah, self-care) tips on how to pivot from the rejection and preserve mental health? Like, very specific to this process where I will be receiving probably hundreds of rejections. Thanks!
