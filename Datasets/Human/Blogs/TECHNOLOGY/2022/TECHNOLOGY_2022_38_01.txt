Hi! Like the title says, I'd like to use some video-editing software to rotate some videos. Preferably, that video editing software would be free. I'd like to rotate my videos only slightly, e.g., 10 or 15 degrees. If anyone could recommend me to any software that can do this, that would be tremendously helpful.
