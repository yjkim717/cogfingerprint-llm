Hi, I staked some Eth using the Leger Lido application, but I am not sure I did a good choice. So I would like to unstack them and get them back in ETH. Can someone explain me the steps? I saw some other posts but did not find these steps. I read about curve, but curve does not see the leger account with the STeth. Do I need first SEND the STeth from the 'Lido Staked ETH' leger account to and Etherium leger account(can I move STeth to an ETH account?) and THEN swap them with curve? Can i have eth and STeth in the same leger account? Thank you!
