Asked in this steam community earlier but couldn't get an answer, so i decided to ask here as well. Copy-paste from steam discussion thread: Hi, until recently i've been plenty happy with my xbox 360 controller, now that it has retired i need new one. I would've bought same controller again - but i couldn't quite find it, so now i'm agonizing over whether i should go with xbox series, or dualsense / ds4. First - price difference(cheaper to more expensive): DS4 +10$ = DualSense +20$ = XBOX Series **My biggest concern is availability of PS controller prompts in games inside and outside of Steam**, i know there are apps that makes use of PS controllers most functions to varying degree, but slight lack of this and that in any given game is alright for me(in theory at least). Target games - anything that doesn't require much mouse usage, i.e. all Dark Souls + Sekiro + Elden Ring. Off off topic - is it 'generally' any easier to get into fighting games with PS controller? Or is it just that xbox 360 controller is a very poor match for those? Wanted to get into Tekken 7, but man .. those inputs were inaccurate as hell.
