Hi. As the title says we are looking for a fulfilment center in the eu and us (preferably a eu one with solid rates for mainland US shipping) The fulfilment center should also be able to receive all of our suppliers items that would come in as well as hold some of our stock. Some items are also on backorder and would be delivered to the center and shipped from there. We donâ€™t really have any experience with fulfilment centers so we hope that our requirements are reasonable. Thank you Edit: our items are clothing (mostly underwear) and shoes
