Hi all, I am currently travelling in Europe, and I find myself sleeping 11-12 hours per night. This is really impacting my ability to do all I want to do. But I also know I'm no good if I haven't slept enough. Has anyone else experienced this or knows what might be causing it? It's not jetlag as I've been in Europe for over a month now, and it's not increased exercise as my apple watch is constant at about 1000 active cals daily. Thanks!
