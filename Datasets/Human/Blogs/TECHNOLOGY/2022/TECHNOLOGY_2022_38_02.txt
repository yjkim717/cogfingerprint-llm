Here’s my question. I’m from the US. I’m going to flight into the Netherlands tomorrow. I have a negative covid-19 test result, but I am missing my vaccine records. Do I need these records to enter the Netherlands? Let me know if you need any more info: I’ll stay on top of this post EDIT: By the way, I already looked through the Netherlands government website. It says, “You must always show a negative test result, even if you have proof of vaccination or recovery. There are exemptions.” It is not clear from this, however, whether proof of vaccination is necessary for entry
