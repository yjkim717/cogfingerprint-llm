2022 284BHS but got the upgraded 15K BTU / 50 AMP service. Live in central TX. On our first summer trip and it was 94 yesterday. Got here at 330 and first thing I did was turn the AC on but didn't get below 80 until like 10p. 93 outside but AC keeping it at 75 but climbing. Is this to be expected? Supposedly my unit is prewired for a 2nd AC so contemplating upgrading.
