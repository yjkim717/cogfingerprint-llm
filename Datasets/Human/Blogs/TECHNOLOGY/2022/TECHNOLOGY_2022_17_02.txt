So I was just down in the workshop fixing a piece of equipment and I notice one hand is starting to sting a bit. That's odd I think, I'm wearing gloves and I've not been dealing with anything materials that usually causes discomfort (oil and grease). I dismiss it as weird, it's not too bad. Five minutes later the pain is getting quite intense so I take my glove off and throw it away, my hand is clean but I scrub it anyway as the pain is quite intense now. I go and get some lunch, hopefully it will calm down a bit. It doesn't, the pain gets worse. I'm starting to think if this doesn't stop soon I might need to seek medical help but this is crazy. I've worked with all these thing many times before with no ill effects. Just as I'm starting to think I might have accidentally done something stupid I realize I've accidentally done something stupid. One of the gloves I put one wasn't new, I'd been processing ghost peppers over the weekend while wearing it. I must have turned it inside out as I took it off thus putting the spice against my skin when I reused it, whoops. I lick the back of my hand. Whoa, seriously spicy. Morale of the story is don't be tight and reuse gloves!
