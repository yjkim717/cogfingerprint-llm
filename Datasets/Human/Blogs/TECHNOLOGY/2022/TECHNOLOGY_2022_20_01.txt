Hi Everyone! 👩‍⚕️ 👨‍⚕️ 🧑‍⚕️ I have been going through some weird symptoms for the past 2 weeks. It started with a bit of a migraine (I get those chronically) then progressed into head pressure and lightheadedness for a few days until I woke up and freaked out because my head felt so pressurized and I felt like I was still dreaming. I went to the ER and was declared non-emergent after a CT scan and blood work. I don’t have a PCP and in fact I was too fatigued to try to find one. Then about 6 days into my symptoms, I developed a slight chest pain as if I had heart palpitations. I went to the ER again, and after a EKG, blood work and chest x-ray, I was again declared non-emergent. I remembered i had a deer tick that I improperly removed so I went to get a Lyme test and am on doxycycline but I never got a bullseye rash and my joints don’t hurt at all. I’ve started to develop slight burning sensation in my elbow and forearm, intermittent pins and needles, newfound motion sickness that i did not have before, shortness of breath, and a very slight sore throat. I also wake up with a rush of anxiety filling my body and I don’t feel calm all day. I went to visit the walk in family doctor here and they said they’ll have me wear a heart monitor for the palpitations and refer me to a neurologist (who can’t see me until first week of October). I’m scared I may have a brain tumor or something but that would come up on a ct scan right? Thanks in advance for any help!
