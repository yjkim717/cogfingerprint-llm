Just a heads up, I live in the Sengkang area so commuting is genuinely a pain in the ass (1hr to and fro uni) and I go to sch everyday with 9am classes. To make it worse, I'm in an engineering course. So when you combine these two, it's the perfect mix to destroy your physical and mental health. Personally, I've been somewhat consistent in getting 7 hrs of sleep (mostly coz i prioritise the hell out of it over studying) but the trade off is that compared to the peeps who stay up (and somehow still function like wtf), I'm not doing well as them when it comes to acads. Tbh, I kinda expected this will happen since I'm prioritising sleep. But, how in the world do you guys find the energy to study once you guys come back home from a long day? I'm legit surviving on a daily basis
