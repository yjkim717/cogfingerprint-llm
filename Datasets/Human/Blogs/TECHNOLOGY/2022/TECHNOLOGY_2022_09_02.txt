You see your team with very low points and instead of helping to capture the point so you can relax and actually SNIPE CAMP, you still sit back and hope your teammates do all the work. Like, you don’t care or gave up or something? You’re nothing special if you get a bunch of kills by sniping, but overall lost the game. P.S. this might be my last post here as I could’ve ranted more before the game “died” and there’s nothing new.
