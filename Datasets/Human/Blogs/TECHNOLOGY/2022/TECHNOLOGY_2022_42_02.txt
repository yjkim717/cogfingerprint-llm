Hi, I have following low-carb (or ket, what is the difference btw?) since 2016 and am quite happy. Since then I have found alternatives for bread, dairy products, syrup, snacks, and even flour (to some extent) that helped a lot in making life easier. Now the only remaining "forbidden" item for which I have no alternative is potato, particularly in the form of chips. Is there anything you have tried and recommend? I am looking ideally for a food item with 0 carbs, or as little as possible. Hence something with 5+ grams of carb per 100 grams is not particularly interesting :-/ Many thanks &#x200B; P.S. Alternatives for rice are also appreciated. I have already tried this Shirataki/Konjak stuff which has 0 carbs, but doesn't feel, smell, or taste anything like rice :D
