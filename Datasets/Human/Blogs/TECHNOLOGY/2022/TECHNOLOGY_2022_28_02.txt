listen, we get it. Chaol's annoying. But do you think sjm went and wrote a whole book about him without realizing this? If there's anything you should have picked up by know is that SJM's writing style is so beautiful- there's so much worldbuilding and so many character arcs. No character is left as an afterthought, even>!maeve ended up having her reasons (still not good ones lol)!<. Even if you simply didn't like Chaol, TOD is a necessary book, bc like every single book, it has a lot of important information. Now could you get through KoA 80% without reading it, but you're missing the \*experience\*. Like, you might as well just read the wiki summaries of the other books too. Most of all, because I feel like so many people need to hear this: TOD IS NOT A NOVELLA. It's not an optional book w/ background info that you can skip. Especially after EOS, I get how it may be frustrating to have to read TOD, but please, please do. You won't regret it. &#x200B; edit: There was a post similar to mine a bit earlier, quite well put and a bit more thorough. Highly recommend you check that out too!
