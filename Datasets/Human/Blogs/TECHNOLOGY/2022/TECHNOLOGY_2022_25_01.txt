I posted here but am hoping to get some direction. I can find no mention of this phrase anywhere on the Internet. "AD FS could not detect other machines joined to this farm." I am going through the process of renewing my 2016 ADFS certificate. I did this last year following steps from this link which worked before However when I go to run the set-adfssslcertifcate I get the message below. Any thoughts on the cause and/or resolution? PS C:\Windows\system32> Set-AdfsSslCertificate -thumbprint 213ae1d16d84a9aafc285a5fcfdf61555cd1b8cd Set-AdfsSslCertificate : AD FS could not detect other machines joined to this farm. Use 'Member' parameter to specify the machines joined to this farm. Refer to ' for more information.
