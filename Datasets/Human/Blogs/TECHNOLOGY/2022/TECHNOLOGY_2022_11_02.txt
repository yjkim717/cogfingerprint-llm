&#x200B; Hi, I'll be spending more time on a more Constantiam-related website, so I've moved the donation store there. Because it's about Constantiam, I can have more fun with it since it's virtually impossible to delude myself into thinking I can make decent money for myself on it. A place to flex my web design and other skills without it turning into a job like Enderbook did. Let me know what you think :) **NEW SHOP ADDRESS:** A reminder to everyone: 100% profits are sent to PhantomCaptain which means if you want to support the server without all the fluff, subscribe to the official Patreon instead: The website itself will be expanded over the next while as I make pages rich with resources from the likes of Beithir's amazing PDF, CHB's construction logs, etc. Stay tuned :)
