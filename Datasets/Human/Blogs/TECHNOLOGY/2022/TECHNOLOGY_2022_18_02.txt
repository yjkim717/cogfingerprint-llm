Hi all Working for a small company. Roughly 100 users and 150 computers in Active Directory. 2 domain controllers a couple of servers (2016) and the rest are Win 10 PC's. We did a vulnerability scan recently to help us to secure our systems and the following vulnerability was noted: **Local Administrator Accounts Allowed Access From Network vulnerability.** The recommended action was: ***"Use the Group Policy setting “Deny access to this computer from the network” to deny local Administrator accounts inbound network access."*** &#x200B; I'm creating a policy for the domain using the setting in the following location: Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\User Rights Assignment I'm using this as a guide: Deny access to this computer from the network (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs The way I'm reading the document it says to set the policy for these accounts: Assign the **Deny access to this computer from the network** user right to the following accounts: * Anonymous logon * Built-in local Administrator account * Local Guest account * All service accounts My question is, I can't seem to figure out which account to add from the domain to deny the **Built-in local administrator** account access. When I try to add the account, I can choose from all the accounts we have in AD but I can't find it anywhere in the listing of accounts. I feel like I must be missing something....any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
