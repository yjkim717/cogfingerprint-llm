I'm a Melburnian and will be returning to Australia for a \~one month for some work and to visit family/friends. It'll be the first time I've been back to Australia since before COVID. Really looking forward to it :) However, I'm coming from Japan. And I want to prepare myself a bit for the reverse culture shock, particularly around COVID stuff. So, r/melbourne, can you help me set my expectations for some of the following? (Keeping in mind I might also be missing/unaware of stuff not on the list below) * When will I be expected to wear a mask socially? e.g. bar, park, office, public transport * Would there ever be a time where wearing mask would generate some bad attention or otherwise be seen a widely silly/overcautious? * Are there any current local laws re COVID restrictions I should be aware of? * Compared to pre-COVID levels, what is foot and road traffic like in the CBD and suburbs? * Do I need to carry any sort of vaccination/testing info for daily activities? * Perhaps most importantly: I have been dying for a sausage roll and a vanilla slice. It's been years. Where should I treat myself?
