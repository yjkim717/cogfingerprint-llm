Not sure if anyone else has had issues...I can't find anything on the official Citra mmj telegram channel. When I open this game it just crashes on Citra mmj. On Citra enhanced it shows up as encrypted ( all though I KNOW I got decrypted- because I downloaded it again from another site ) Anyone have any ideas? Is it an issue with my hardware? S22 ultra SD version
