A somewhat embarrassing story, but I accidentally ended up opening a Walgreens credit card account. I signed up for a Walgreens membership for discounts and the cashier also signed me for a credit card. I should have realized that something fishy is going on the moment she asked my ssn, but by the moment I realized that I'm signing up for a credit card, it was already too late. I rarely visit Walgreens and don't need their card, but I'm curious if it's a good idea to call them and close it immediately or if I should just keep it since there's no annual fee. Any advice would be appreciated!
