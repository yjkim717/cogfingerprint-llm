"Yesterday I saw people complaining about bungie constantly feeding us old exotics through the coolest dungeons and how they never gave us anything new Today I see people complaining on how they expected mythoclast and are just getting a disappointing new kinetic fusion rifle" Original Tweet Do you have a valid reason to be upset about the reward, I dunno, I guess you have a right to be upset, but you were also the same people that set yourselves up for this. There were very little clues to it being mythoclast, or the D1 legendary or even exotic swords. It was just speculation, granted it wasn't completely baseless speculation. But nonetheless, bungie we're not the ones to over hype it. Not every exotic can be broken. This isn't like an attack at the community but I'm just pointing out that we're constantly overhyping things ourselves then blaming bungie when it's not what we want. I've seen so many people say, "Why can't bungie just listen to the community????" There are 1.3 million people in this subreddit alone. That doesn't include everyone on Twitter, the forms, etc. How can bungie make 1.3 million people happy. Not to mention, how can bungie make any reasonable amount of people happy when they just flip flop to complain like Solar Flair pointed out. Not every complaint is gonna be acknowledged, especially when people can't agree on it.
