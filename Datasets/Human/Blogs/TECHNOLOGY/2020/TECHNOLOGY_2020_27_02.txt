I live in South United States (yay). I've been nonstop angry for like 3 months now. Its ebbs and flows with my mood, but under the surface, I can barely contain my anger and frustration at all the selfishness in full view. I've taken breaks from social media and the news, but its all hard to ignore. From Covid, to racial tensions, to police brutality, to Trump, my mind just bounces from one thing to the next constantly. I'm tired of being frustrated. Anyone else feel the same way?
