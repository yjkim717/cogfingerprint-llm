So, I'm a big fan of the Dark Souls series and the combat kinda reminds of a Souls-like game. I've been watching some "beginners guides" but its so much information that I cant retain it without experiencing the game first. I would also like to play with some people to learn the basics and maybe some advance stuff. None of my friends want to buy the game so I'd appreciate anyone who wants to play with me.
