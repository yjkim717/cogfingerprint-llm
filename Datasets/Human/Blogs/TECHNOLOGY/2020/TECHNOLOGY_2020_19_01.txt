Seems like the Atlanteans left behind a lot of valuable data in Atlantis's database some of which would be dangerous if the wraith got hold of it My question then is if the lore has already established they didnt just nuke all data when they left why did they not leave schematics for how to create ZPMs in said database considering Atlantis runs on the things You would think would would have a guide on how to create more 'batteries' (Yes i know using the term batteries is not doing ZPMs any justice but at its core a ZPM is a battery just a stupid long life one)
