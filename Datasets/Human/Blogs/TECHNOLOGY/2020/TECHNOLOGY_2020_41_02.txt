Posting here because your customer service is garbage. Over 3 Months ago, I traded in my phone, my wifes phone, and added my Sister in law. When we traded phones, there was a promo where my Wife could trade in her IPhone 6s, and get an 8 for free (with promo + upgrade). They TOOK (emphasis on this part) her phone, and gave her the iPhone 8. The store manager said "You will start seeing the credit applied once they receive the phone." Flash forward to now, and the phone never made it. Still seeing the charges on the bill and had the run arounds with Customer Service, despite the INVOICE that SAYS they took our phone. Now, we just got off the phone with a Rep who said we are not getting the phone back or the promo, since there "was no promo" (other past calls with customer service said there was). Now, I've been a loyal AT&T customer for 3 years now, and also have AT&T TV. Despite them taking our channels and raising prices on AT&T TV (was DirecTV Now) we still use it. That along with terrible customer service in the past, I've just about had it with AT&T. Since customer service didn't help, hopefully this public post will. Update: Got in contact with District Manager, the phone we purchased wasn't eligible for the promo because we baught the 64GB model and not the 128GB model. However, since the storefront sold us on the phone, the manager is giving us the new phone for free, and the store employees will be getting promo retraining. Thanks for all the help guys.
