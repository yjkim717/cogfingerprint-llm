If cephalonwannab.com info is valid then i have 2 options: 1) Rattleguts-Lovetap-Splat kitgun 2) Tombfinger-Haymaker-Stitch Normally i would take #2 because of higher accuracy, however #2 is a projectile weapon, while #1 is a hitscan weapon ... Is 20 accuracy + hitscan better than 50 + projectile? I'm in a pickle, help me
