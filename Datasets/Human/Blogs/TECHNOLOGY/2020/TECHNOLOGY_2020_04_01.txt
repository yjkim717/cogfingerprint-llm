>**What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.** I use this PC mainly for Gaming. FPS games, high-end games too like Witcher 3. I do a little bit of programming too and use 2 monitors. >**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** Â£300 - I already have a bunch of PC parts, so I only want to buy some parts. >**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** ASAP, literally today, my current build doesn't work because something is wrong with my motherboard. I work remotely so ideally I'd like to have the PC by Monday. (I have amazon prime) >**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** The parts from my current PC that NEED UPGRADING are listed on the table below Current PC Parts|NEEDS UPGRADING :--|:-- Motherboard: ASUS Z87-K|NEEDS UPGRADING RAM: Vengeance 16GB 2x8 DDR3|NEEDS UPGRADING SSD: Don't currently have one|NEEDS UPGRADING PC Case: Zalman Z11 Plus|NEEDS UPGRADING **NOTE:** Preferably, I would like to keep my RAM since I don't need more than 16GB, but because all the decent motherboards support DDR4 I feel forced to upgrade my RAM to DDR4 16GB. If there are any good recommendations for a motherboard that supports DDR3, then I would like to keep my current RAM. >**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** UK >**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** Current PC Parts|KEEP :--|:-- CPU: Intel Core i7 4770k|KEEP GPU: Gigabyte GTX 1060 6GB|KEEP HDD: WD Blue 1TB|KEEP Power Supply: Corsair RM850|KEEP Heatsink: Thermaltake Tt CPU Heatsink|KEEP Monitor 1: 24 inch MSI 144hz 1920x1080 curved|KEEP Monitor 2: BenQ LED 21 inch 1920x1080|KEEP Power Supply: Corsair RM850|KEEP Keyboard: Logitech G213|KEEP Mouse: KLIM Aim Gaming Mouse|KEEP >**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** Nope >**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)** I would like to get a new SSD and use my current HDD along with the new SSD for the build. >**What type of network connectivity do you need? (Wired and/or WiFi) If WiFi is needed and you would like to find the fastest match for your wireless router, please list any specifics.** I will be using Wired connection. WiFi is not really all that needed, but it wouldn't hurt. >**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?** Whatever works best with my parts, but I enjoy LED lighting. >**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?** No >**Extra info or particulars:** As you can see I have pretty old parts on this setup. Which is why I'm worried about compatibility with the parts I'm going to keep. Preferably, I would like to keep my RAM since I don't need more than 16GB, but because all the decent motherboards support DDR4 I feel forced to upgrade my RAM to DDR4 16GB. I'm also worried about my i7 4770k, since it's pretty old now and I don't know how it will work with the newer motherboards.
