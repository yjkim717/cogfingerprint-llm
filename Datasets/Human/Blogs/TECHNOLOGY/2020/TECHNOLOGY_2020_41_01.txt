As the information presented in the link shows, there has been no major improvements made in the acquisition of weapon systems in a long time. There are major problems, some of the following being: 1. Since most if not all military programs are contracted out, there is a lack of technical knowledge required for the oversight of such programs. 2. Many of the high budgeted items are geared toward how we will solve problems 10 - 15 years into the future, instead of focusing on lower cost solutions to our current problems. (Generally, the budget for future programs destroys the budget for "less advanced" programs). 3. Many at risk programs (or programs waayyy past the "at-risk" designation) usually lack congressional oversight, since program cancellation may cost votes. Take Raytheon's OCX work as an example. They "finished" OCX in 2019, *3 YEARS* after the original projected date of completion, and are *already planning another hardware revision by 2022*. Needless to say, I'm sure there are other good, maybe even better examples, but I'm familiar with OCX. Another point of info is that these problems were written about in 2008, before Obama was elected. For those interested, read " What's wrong with weapons acquisitions?". Found here: I feel that talking about how we can reform the Weapons Acquisitions to reduce costs would score big points for Joe among Republicans who want to save money, and Democrats who want to find ways to fund social programs. What does Reddit think about this? \* Link to information regarding OCX problems:
