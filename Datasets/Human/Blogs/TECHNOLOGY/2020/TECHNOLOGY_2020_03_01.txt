Ben brought Rey to life, getting her pregnant too on the end of tros. Rey's kiss confirms that she accepts this pregnancy from him, but she cries for his death. The bad thing he can't be with her, but it gave her what she wanted most want,A FAMILY. So it's sad to think of Rey alone taking care of two twin children (she hid two lightsabers). : / But, right, star wars is not a happy ending (this is not a reylo) and always talks about family problems. So will it be that in a future trilogy of star wars the twin children of Rey (bloodline skywalker and palpatine) will have a connection with the baby yoda? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” note: i would really like the twin children of rey to be just girls to give a different series of star wars, since the star wars producers love a lot the idea of â€‹â€‹twin children very much.
