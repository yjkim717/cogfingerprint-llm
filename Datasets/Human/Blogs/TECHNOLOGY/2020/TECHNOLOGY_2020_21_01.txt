Hi friends, I'm trying to create a new live event for my organization in office 365. I am an admin user and I made sure I have the permission for creating live events in the teams & stream admin centers, but I still don't see the button to create a live event in neither app. Does it take time for the permission to go through? Waited about half an hour so far? Or did they remove that feature?
