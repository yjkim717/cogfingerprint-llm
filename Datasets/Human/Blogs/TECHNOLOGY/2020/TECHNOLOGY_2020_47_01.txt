So I ask because there are a few tiles in my bathtub that are out more than others. They don't feel loose, don't move when I touch them or anything. Look I am a new home owner and I'm a little scared so I could use the advise. I did the caulk around my tub maybe 6 months ago and I thought I did it right. There are some lines around some of the tiles that are wet looking constantly and I think that it's absorbed the water. There are no loose tiles in the shower but I wonder if the water has gotten behind it and pushed it outward or if it's just me freaking out. There are a couple like this but the one I'm looking at is one of the one's with the wet grout.
