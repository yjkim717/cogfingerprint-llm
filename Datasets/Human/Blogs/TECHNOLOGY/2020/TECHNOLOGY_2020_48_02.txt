It can obviously tow. Holy !@#$ can it off-road. Let's just not even talk about bed-size because mistaking a work of art like the R1T for a drywall trolley is borderline offensive. Also how much for an aftermarket bed extender for any ICE truck? $200? But now that the awesome truck stuff is out of the way, I'd really like to learn more solid details on the UI and the interior features like how and where stuff can be plugged in, whether a universal rails kit will be available for the gear tunnel. What infotainment features will be available? Will there be any compatibility with Android and Apple music subscriptions? Can third parties write apps for the infotainment (demo UI design looks awfully extendable)? One feature I'm particularly interested in, and would love to see confirmed, is what looks like a forward camera that gives you perspective from the cameras near the front bumper. I would love that on my CX-9. It's really hard to gauge distance when you're that high off the ground and your last car was a Civic that you drove for 20 years. I'm sure that's not going to be any easier in a Rivian with the suspension set to max-height. And what's the autonomous plan? I'm not expecting it for years, but still curious to see what you're able to leverage through partnerships like Amazon and also what level 2 features will be available right away.
