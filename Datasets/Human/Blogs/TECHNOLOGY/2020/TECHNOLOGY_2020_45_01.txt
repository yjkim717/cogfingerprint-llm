FatCoach is an experimental project for a Back-End as a Service (BaaS) framework (using the Kotlin language) which abstracts the underlying SQL database from Front-End developers. FatCoach shares a similar purpose to GraphQL; however, with a different philosophy and architecture. GraphQL was designed mainly for interoperability, and because of that it cannot expose a flexible query DSL to the Front-End. A powerful query language requires an assumption of the underlying database and its capabilities. GraphQL cannot expose SQL features because the data source could be a REST service instead. Notheless, GraphQL is being used for BaaS with SQL backends, despite the mismatch. I suppose because there's nothing better for the purpose. This motivated me to build something that was on my wish list for almost 5 years. Checkout the new idea on the project page. Feedback and help are welcome to the project. This is still very experimental, but the query language already works against a H2 database. And since it's done with jOOQ, probably works with other databases. The best help I could get is if anyone is willing to use such framework in a showcase. I'm available to improve the framework for the required needs and as long it follows the framework philosophy. Work is also required for the client side libraries, and probably for an administration web console.
