Hello! I'm not sure if this belong in this subreddit, but here we go. I'm trying to get into publishing, but I'm not sure how competitive I am. So far, I have applied to the Princeton University Press and The New Press. Here's a run-down of the most important parts of my resume: Work Experience Academic Conference Coordinator * Delegated and tracked each contributors' assignments and deadlines. * Conducted meetings with members of the editorial staff to collaborate and review conference proposals. * Proofread, edited, and evaluated final copy to verify content aligned with established guidelines. Editor and Proofreader * Researched content and grammatical issues to check accuracy of information. * Reviewed graduate student papers for grammar, spelling, punctuation, syntax, accuracy and compliance with quality standards. Editorial Internship * Drafted between eight and ten pieces each week with up to 1000 word count. * Reviewed and edited between six and eight stories every week by marking errors and assisting story development Pitched headlines and article ideas daily I graduated from Uni with an English and Philosophy major. I minored in Japanese. I completed a senior thesis. My upper-division GPA was a 3.7, and my cumulative a 3.5. I speak Spanish fluently, and I'm conversationally fluent in Japanese. I can read French, but speak it terribly. As I'm writing this, I discovered a typo in the resumes I sent to the Princeton Press and The New Press: I'm not sure if they would reject my app because of this. I would appreciate your perspective! Am I competitive? If I'm not, how could I make myself more competitive? In advance, thank you so much!
