Hello, this is my first post here, not sure if the right subreddit but here it goes.Currently I have a Logitech Z906 sound system that I use in 4.1 mode at parties. It is 500W RM supposedly, but the power consumption is like 190W, accounting for losses I am guessing it outputs like 170W (I also have a real 150W RMS guitar amp, and the Logitech system is a little louder than that). I would like to improve the volume at parties and the sound quality if possible, but also have a set of speakers I can use for my PC at home other wise. First I was thinking of a party speaker, such as the JBL Partybox 100, but they are quite expensive and I want to do them as cheap as possible. Loudness if of my main concern. Secondly, I was thinking of building my own amp based on this Class D 2x120W one, which I believe should be louder than my current setup: The problem I have are the speakers, not sure what to pair with it. I was thinking of getting 2x150W RMS bookshelf speakers, found a pair of older Sony SS-NX1, but I don't know how they sound or if they are truly 150W RMS, or if the bass of bookshelf speakers is any good. So I am looking of doing/buying some sort of high powered speakers that are also quite small in size. Don't have any tools so building my own speakers is out of the question, maybe I could just get a base cabinet and buy separate woofers/tweeters?Or are there any consumer products that fit my needs? Any help is much appreciated, thanks!
