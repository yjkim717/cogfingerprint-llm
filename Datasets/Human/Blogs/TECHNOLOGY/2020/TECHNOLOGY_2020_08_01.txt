Hey everyone! I'm just over a week sober, and I'm finding that I cannot STAND perfume/fragrances. Has anyone else experienced this? Looking through previous posts I see the opposite... maybe I'm just detoxing, somehow? I bought a bottle of an old favorite perfume to celebrate sobriety, but now I fear I may need to return it.
