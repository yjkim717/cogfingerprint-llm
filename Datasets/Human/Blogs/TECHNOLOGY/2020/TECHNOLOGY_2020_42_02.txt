Hi, My wife and I are trying to conceive. I came across these things called "Home Insemination Kits" and thought about trying them, before starting more complicated treatments like IUI and IVF. &#x200B; However, I am absolutely inexperienced in the whole thing. Does it actually work? If yes, where can I find "legitimate" kits and instructions? Where can I read more? And finally, if it works, then why should one go through the burden of IUI? Aren't they more or less the same thing? Any info and experiences are more than appreciated. Many thanks
