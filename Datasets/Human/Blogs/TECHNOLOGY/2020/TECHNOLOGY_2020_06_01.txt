2017 honda odyssey (SE) with 34.6k miles for 28k or 2018 honda odyssey (EX-L) with 16k miles for 31k &#x200B; my wife likes the 2017 bc she wants to keep payments low, and she bought her last car from the same dealer so she thinks she'll get treated better, but i think overall the 2018 is a better value. Thoughts?
