For a really long time now, my cat occasionally poops in very inconvenient places, such as expensive rugs, beds, etc. We clean it and wash it every time, but I donâ€™t know what to do. His litter box is in the garage with a little door that he can go through. Previously it was in the house though (a few months ago) and we still had the problem. Any ideas how to deal with this?
