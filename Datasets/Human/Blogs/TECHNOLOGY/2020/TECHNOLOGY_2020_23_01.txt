This started a few days ago. Every time I turn on and connect my bluetooth speaker and join a Zoom meeting, the audio routed through the bluetooth speaker sounds as if I'm on an oldschool GSM 2G voice call. Other apps like Youtube or Spotify play high quality audio just fine. A few things that I noticed: - When I change volume with Zoom audio playing via bluetooth, the small iOS 13 volume bar that shows up on the top of the screen has a little phone icon, as opposed to the normal loudspeaker icon; this confirms it knows it downgrades the audio - When I play some high quality audio from another app and I switch to the previously opened Zoom app (no active meeting, no audio, just idle Zoom app), the other app audio quality goes down to the voice call too - Airpods sound fine - Zoom with just iPad speakers and not bluetooth sounds fine - This also happened when I was on a Google Meet presentation Tried "forgetting" and re-adding the speaker via iOS bluetooth settings. This is very annoying. Please help! This happens with iPad Pro 2018 running the latest iOS/ipadOS 13 with *both* JBL Charge 3 as well as JBL Go 2.
