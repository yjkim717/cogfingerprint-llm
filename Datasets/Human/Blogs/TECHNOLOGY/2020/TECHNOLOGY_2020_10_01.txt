Looking at UBC for grad school and obviously I can get way better deals on rent farther outside the city. According to google maps, driving in to school from Oakridge/mt pleasant/upper Richmond is only like 20-25 minutes, whereas the bus is supposedly over an hour. Is this actually true? I feel like the drives couldnâ€™t possibly be that short. If they are that short, my second question is: how is the parking situation (assuming I pay for a pass)? Do the parkades fill up quickly?
