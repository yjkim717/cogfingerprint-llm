In Czech there is a class of pronouns which originated (possibly) due to the increasing cohesion between *ten/ta/to* (inflected according to gender, number and case), which are context-sensitive demonstratives meaning either 'this' or 'that', and a series of clitics such as *hle*, *týž*, *to* and *tam*. What we get in Modern Czech is, using the latter as examples: *tenhle/tahle/tohle, tentýž/tatýž/totýž* and so on. In all of the cases, the inflection is retained in the *ten/ta/to* part, e.g. *těchhle* (*těch* 'gen./loc. pl. of *ten/ta/to*' + *hle*) would be genitive/locative plural of *tenhle/tahle/tohle.* In Modern Czech they cannot be split, which means that e.g. *těchhle* is considered to be a single unit. I have encountered a similar phenomenon in Malayalam, where e.g. the word for 'everybody' is *ellavarum*, consisting of *ella*, which is a quantifier, *-var*, the personal plural suffix and *-um*, which is a suffix you always need to add to a quantified word. Then, the dative would be *ellavarkkum*, that is, the dative suffix *-kkɯ* is attached to *ellavar*, which has no meaning without *-um*, and then *-um* is combined with *ellavarkkɯ,* also void of meaning (ɯ > u is a common boundary phenomenon in Malayalam). However, *-um* is also a common clitic meaning 'and', though in the above case it is clearly grammaticalized. I think incorporation is here a misnomer, as it usually applies to verbs, but the overall concept seems to apply at least to the Czech examples. Do you know any work on the topic?
