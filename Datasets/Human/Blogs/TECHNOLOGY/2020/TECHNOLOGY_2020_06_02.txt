So I'm not a full time youtuber or anything close to that but I do love Xenogears so in between working a full time job and taking care of my kids I've been working on a "Xenogears Expained" project. Recently, I've released part 3 here: Again I don't have a whole lot of time to invest in production or anything like that but I hope you guys appreciate the work I put into it. If you think it sucks then hit the dislike but leave me a comment on how I can improve. If you like it, please subscribe as I'll be making more videos about Xenogears even after I complete the project. Thanks and I hope you enjoy. Keep in mind this is part 3 and the beginning is the intro so start here if you want to watch from the beginning. The production and sound quality does get better as I've invested in a better microphone and software over time.
