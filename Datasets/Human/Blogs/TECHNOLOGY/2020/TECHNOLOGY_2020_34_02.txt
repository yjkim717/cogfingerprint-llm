I'm calling around trying to decide between shipping and going to pick up. The problem is our largest vehicle is a 2012 Nissan Xterra. It's a decent size trunk and the seats fold down Anyone know if there's a shot it'll fit or the dimensions of the box? Would save me a good chunk of money to pick up vs have it delivered Local dealer offering $2,375 for YS640, cover, grill grates, Diffuser and 4 bags of pellets and pick up on 9/14. Pretty tempting but this dealer is 2 hrs away.
