Does anyone have any suggestions for a set of best practices for monitoring Exchange with SCOM? I'm trying to nail down a specific set of overrides, as well as trying to stop SCOM from alerting us multiple times for similar alerts. It would also be nice to set up a rollup alert that would just send a single email when one metric went down (for example), and then relegate any future alerts to the console (with no emails), as opposed to sending multiple emails when various metrics within a specific Exchange Health Set went red. Finally, is there any way to consolidate related health sets into a single alert? For example, there's an "ActiveSync," "ActiveSync.Health," and an "ActiveSync.Proxy," and while I get that they're all slightly different, given that we're monitoring Exchange 2016, they really don't seem to be (if I'm reading the descriptions correctly). This is what I'm looking at: Along with this: The Exchange 2013 MP guide tells me nothing, and everything I've found online merely points to definitions or overall SCOM strategies, but I haven't found anything yet that just says, "here's how you should monitor Exchange with SCOM."
