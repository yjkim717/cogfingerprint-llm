Hiiii people from reddit community. Well I have many doubts about how to get an opportunity to do a medical degree in Germany. I already have a degree in health and a master's degree in health sciences, even entered another health course(nursing) in my country but it is not in my interest (Brazil). Unfortunately I am not able to afford a private university so the ideal would be to enter a free university. So I don't even know where to start: - Is there a possibility for Germany to evaluate my foreign undergraduate diploma to apply for university places? - How to transfer course? - Or do I have to do a year of studienkolleg? For me it would be great if after a selective process I could take advantage of the disciplines I have already taken and also find a job to be able to support myself there in the cost of living. I particularly love cold climates and intend to do medicine mainly to be employed and to be able to contribute to the population and society. From personal experience it is very very bad to be be an unemployed young adult. Therefore my plans are to stay in Germany just to study, to graduate. It depends on a specialization, but then after I intend to go back to my country. Anyway, I would like to express my gratitude for reading this message x]
