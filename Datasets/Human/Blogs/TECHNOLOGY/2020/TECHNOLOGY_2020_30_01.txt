I managed to write a 1500 words SoP I was happy with, but most of the schools I'm applying for require SoP to be 1000 words at most. I shortened my SoP to that length, but I'm afraid that now it might sound a bit too dry and confusing. I'd like to know what you think about my SoP and would like to hear any suggestions. Let me know if you could take a look at my SoP!
