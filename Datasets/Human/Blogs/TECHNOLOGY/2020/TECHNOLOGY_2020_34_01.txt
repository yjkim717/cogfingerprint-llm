Long story short our oldest is 3.5 years old, youngest is 2. The oldest has been an absolute beating when it comes to sleep even though we've always kept solid night time routines, the younger is excellent. We start bed time at 715p with books, etc. and up at 645a weekdays. She is almost always up til 9p (as late as 11) and by 6a or earlier. Best thing we ever did was get one of those nighttime routine clocks so at least in the morning she stays in her room (most the time). The evenings though my wife and I essentially have to go to bed immediately or she comes in the kitchen, etc. and won't go to her room. Nap time at home? Nonexistent. Naps fine at day care and grandparents but won't for us. It's flat out **exhausting** and have no clue where to go from here. Also, neither has slept in our bed once and this has been an issue for the oldest about a year or more now. Pediatrician said maybe just needs less sleep than most? Edit : why the downvotes :/
