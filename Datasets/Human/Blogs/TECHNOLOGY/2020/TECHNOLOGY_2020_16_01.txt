Like many of you, now I am in Apocalypse difficulty. And if you understand the skills, at some point you will find weapons that will let you do Apocalypse without too much struggle. At the end.. it is easy.. and there are no more challenges. **Is jungle just going to add a bunch of UNBALANCED items, and monsters to kill, that's it?** **The game needs much more deepness.** And I do not mean from the point of view of the character build.. but.. for the game... the NPC is not challenging, and ***challenge other players in any form is not a thing.*** Is this GAME already dead?
