Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice regarding how safe xrays are. My wife works as a dental nurse and she is looking at persuing a career as a dentist or hygiene therapist however, after working at a few dental practices she's mentioned that an odd number of dentists have cancer, which got my wondering what kind of correlation exists here. I don't think anyone's really studied this with big numbers so I guess im a bit paranoid. She recently had an issue with a thyroid in her neck, where the thyroid has become larger than normal. This has been checked by drs and scanned etc, the diagnosis was nothing to worry about. However thyroid problems and cancer are raised as risks when using xrays. Does anyone know what the risk is of using xrays as a medical professional? In the dental industry the dentists and nurses perform about 6-10 xrays per day, so there's a good amount. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated by anyone, if your a medical professional can you also say so. Kind regards Robbo
