**I think this is a great and super fun game.At the same time** I agree with who says It could have been much better. And with better I mean deeper.. more levels, different multiplayer modes (E.g see: I agree **it is quite a short game for its price** and for what this game could have been. Said that.. is it a good move buy the Hero version without any idea of what they are going to implement, and if they are going to make good improvements? If they want my money for a Hero version I think they should do a bit better and give me some great new features to have fun with! Thoughts?
