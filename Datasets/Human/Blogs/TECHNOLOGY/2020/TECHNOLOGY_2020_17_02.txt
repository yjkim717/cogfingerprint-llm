Let me start by saying I know this is a rather open ended question. I'm hoping some kind people will be able to give me a commissioning check list or at least pointers of what I should look our for / common pit falls. I'm a software developer by day but I'm forced by circumstance to wear the sys admin hat as well. In the next few days I need to set up a server for our business to host services for a new customer. We have a hosting provider that we use that provides a decent service so on the hardware front at least I think we're sorted. The server will be running Windows Server 2019 and we only need remote desktop, FTP and HTTP services open. This will be a completely stand alone server so no active directory or anything else fancy. All passwords will be strong, randomly generated by a password generator. I run a server like this already and so far so good but whenever I build something like this I want to make sure I do it better each time. My biggest concern is the remote desktop configuration, I know our existing server gets regular login attempts from black hatters and I'm nervous having just the one line of defence (password). In answer to questions I know will get asked: Why not use AWS / other cloud? Some important pieces of our software aren't cloud ready and it would cost a fortune compared to renting a dedicated machine. Why don't you hire a system admin? We don't have the money. Every penny is accounted for and there's no budget to "do it properly". Thanks and happy holidays. EDIT: I should have said I'm using SFTP (provided by IIS) and HTTPS (provided by Apache) both secured by Let Encrypt certs, this is how my other server is set up as well. To clarify, the customers don't need remote desktop access by two people in our company do.
