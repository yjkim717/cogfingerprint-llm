So I've decided to start an Ironman due to staying at home a lot more, and it's hard to really know what to do. I got a few quests done and grinded out full graceful, but mainly because I didn't need any supplies for those outside of some cake and runes from stronghold cash. It's hard to know what to do when the game mode feels so directionless. What are the grinds I should start now? I know most people just say quest, quest, quest, especially early on, but what else can I throw in to spice it up, because I abhor questing. Thanks! Edit: And I really just need like a general idea of what to do from a guide. I found one guide in a google doc that explained everything to do, down to what items to pick up where, all the way to b-gloves, which is a little excessive imo.
