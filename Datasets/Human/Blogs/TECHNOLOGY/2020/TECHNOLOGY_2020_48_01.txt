We're 10 months out, possibly less. All anybody knows is that as of January (if you've been paying closer attention than most), a "well-equipped mid-range with an electrochromic roof, will cost 69k." <--a paraphrase but basically what was said in January. It is now 7 months later. Can we GET SOME MORE DETAILS!! Please! I'm not annoyed because I need to know things before I need to know them. I'm annoyed because I'm trying to financially plan and I have no idea what for. I make more than 69K in a year, but not in a week or a month or in a quarter.
