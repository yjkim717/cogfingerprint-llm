Hey everyone, I feel like I'm "late to the pandemic"--I've been living in my parents' home since March, but I was doing so much avoidance that I'm only now confronting my high discomfort. I've stopped drinking, but I still stay up all night because it's the only time I can have some quiet and space. I think this is giving me seasonal depression and making me more on edge. I want to wake up early and have a routine. The issue is that my room is smack in the middle of the small house. The kitchen is next door, the hall is outside my door and next to that is the living room. The front door is next to my room, up the stairs. There is a big extension now, and my mom and dad both have their own private space distant from any noise. They also both have hearing loss due to age, and dont understand or care to understand aspergers, so they just think I'm being a controlling jerk if I try to arrive at a solution. They never keep their word. Basically I'm going insane. I'm wearing bose headphones with earplugs or more headphones underneath. But I am so sensitive and have such a strong startle response that I hear their footfalls, the door closing, my mom talking (some childhood trauma there, so she's also triggering).... it's just so much, I feel under assault every waking moment. The whole reason I moved in with them is that the loneliness of being alone was horrrrrific, I knew I mentally wouldnt have survived the pandemic. But this is taking a huge toll too. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks :)
