Working my way through Conspiracy and I have a question regarding his notion that we are puppets (I was never good at reading philosophical works). From his understanding of the different philosophers he mentions, we are uncanny beings because we are progenerated without our consent and are therefore copies of copies. We are cursed with consciousness and the notion that we will one day die; to deal with this, we deliberately limit our consciousness, rendering our reality a self-imposed illusion. So, in other words, we are both puppet and puppet-master, a kind of mash-up Pinocchio and Geppetto; our own consciousness is the puppet-master that blocks us from the suffering of living. For some reason, I'm hung up on this idea that we are puppets. Anyone else have a different understanding of what Ligotti is saying?
