Hey, I’m a cs major in my last semester of freshman year. I will be a sophomore in spring. What are interviews like (questions, interviewers, and what’s the highest round you’ve done)? If anyone could answer this I would appreciate it so much. I feel like I am not on the right track to buffing my resume. I didn’t even think about internships until last week, so I think I’m too late to even be interviewed. I’m in a 2+3 program that has me in a school without any cs programs/majors for 2 years and in ba/grad school for 3 years at a college with cs. So I have absolutely no idea how to code... yet. I am going to study on my own before I get to grad school. I’m just scared I’m not on the same track as other cs majors in traditional schools. TIA
