I am very ignorant on this whole entire subject. I’ve been a console pleb my whole life. I’ve been presented with the opportunity to buy a secondhand pc at $850 and I just wanted some help with whether or not this was a good build. I want to play high res fps games like siege or apex. Can anyone help me figure out whether I’m making a good purchase or not lol? Info by seller: EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 SC ($900) ASUS Rog STRIX B350-F Gaming AM4 ($250-350) AMD Ryzen 5 1600 3.2ghz OC to 3.9Ghz ($100) Ballistix Sport LT 2x8GB DDR4 Ram ($60) Color changing fans, water cooled.
