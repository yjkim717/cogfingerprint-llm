Hi there, so I've been just buying some coins here and there with my credit card on Coinbase. I want to take it to the next level to be able to buy larger amounts and also transfer funds to my bank account. So I'm just wondering, as a Canadian, what are my options for exchanges that let me link a bank account to buy and sell and what is the best bank to go with that allows this? I'm also wondering if there is any information out there that breaks down the small fees of the major exchanges as I've noticed quite a few differences from the ones I've used. Thanks for any info, much appreciated.
