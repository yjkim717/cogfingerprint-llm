I usually start out with a build that eventually turns into a jack of all trades and I usually leave the stealth + archer part for last. It's fun... For a couple of minutes... and then I want to get physical. I tend to prefer a melee focused archer to a stealthy one. If I have to go with stealth; daggers and invisibility are way more fun but that's just my opinion.
