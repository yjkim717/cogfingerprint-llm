I graduated from University in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and English. After graduating I taught English in Spain and Japan. Now, I'm home and living with family. I want to become an associate for either a big publishing or journalism firm. I am hoping that doing this they could pay for my masters. However, I never interned during college. I was not career oriented. I was much more concerned with debating philosophy and acting Shakespeare in local theatres than I was with planning my career path. Currently, I'm interning for YourTango. It's a website geared for giving relationship advice to woman. The experience seems good: I write articles, edit the work of other writers, and pitch ideas. But, I don't know how prestigious YourTango is: would this internship make me competitive enough for fellowships with big-time journalism/publishing firms? I'm considering taking on at least two or three other internships. My question is, how screwed am I? How long will it take before I'm competitive enough to compete with someone who interned throughout college? What can I do now to make myself more competative than them? Thank you!
