Avoiding any spoilers, I was curious if u are going for using Illithid powers. I have read the abilities are so cool and powerful, but they come with a cost. Feels a bit frustrating there is such a cool mechanic in place BUT if you use it you may mess up things.. :( . I may do a run ad hoc where I am evil and use Illithid powers
