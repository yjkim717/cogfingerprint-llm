I bought a 2022 Jayco SLX last January. The first time we used the slide we had rain and there was an obvious leak. So I drove back to the dealer 3 hours away and dropped him off for them to fix. The next time we went out and it rained...leaked again....so I took it back to them 6 hour round trip and supposedly they for sure fixed it. Fast forward to today and we got some rain last night with the slide open and well there's water inside... What are my options at this point? It's going to be an issue for the life of the trailer and I can already see orange residue that I'm guessing eventually turns moldy. Am I a candidate for calling a lemon law lawyer here?
