I am a third country national needing to apply for a J1 visa in Canada. The earliest and only visa appointments available when booking the initial appointment were for 2026 and only for Consulate A. My DS-2019 start date is late January 2024. Based on it being a J visa and the start date being before the first available appointment date, I am eligible for an expedited visa appointment. In the expedited appointment request form, there appears to be an option to select *any* consulate or embassy in Canada to request the expedited appointment. Am I obliged to request for Consulate A, or may I request for any consulate/embassy in Canada? Would this choice affect the chances of the expedited request being granted?
