currently trying to get ssl certs from lets encrypt using duck dns and nginx proxy manager (just gonna shorten to npm). atm i dont plan on exposing my services to the outside world. i just want to have ssl certs for the services in my home lab so i dont get http warnings. i was following this guide ( to get the certs set up. i got up to the step where i had to create the cert in nginx proxy manager. in npm im getting this error. ( in the first image is my selections for making the ssl cert in npm. 2nd is my duck dns page (email and token blurred). i have set the ip on the duckdns page to the ip of the debian 12 box running all my services on my local network. the server im running this off of has pihole and npm running in docker containers. the docker-compose files i have used for pihole and nginx proxy manager are the template compose files provided by each respective project. for pihole the only change i made to the file was the admin password and a container name. for npm, the changes i made to the file was to add on a container name and to change port 80:80 to 82:82 (done so that i was able to get npm up and running, leaving it on port 80 caused it to not start. i assume this is because pihole also uses port 80) in my router, i set the dns to my debain box (connected via ethernet). in pihole, i have a dns record for bread.local set to the ip of the box. i also have a cname record that points my duckdns domain to the bread.local domain. im not sure what im doing wrong or know where to start looking to troubleshoot this.
