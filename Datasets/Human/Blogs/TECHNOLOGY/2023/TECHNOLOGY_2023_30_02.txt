I am considering returning to college because my H1B wasn't selected two times, and Cornell Tech seems like a good college for someone living in NYC. I already have US school credentials and close to 3 yoe, so I don't think a graduate degree would help me much in terms of career opportunities. I like the Cornell Tech campus and considering applying for their CS ME program, but there's no way I can justify the cost of attendance. Does anyone know if Cornell Tech ever gives full scholarships, and if so, what are the chances of getting one? Thanks!
