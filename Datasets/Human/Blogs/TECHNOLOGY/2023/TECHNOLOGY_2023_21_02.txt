I've been using Pioneer headphones for years now (HDJ500 / CUE1), however there is a few things that bug me: * Soundprofile: I love how it sounds when listening to music, but since they have quite strong lows, I feel like I'm having a harder time hearing steps, shots, etc. in games. * Closed back: I tend to mumble / slur words a bit when I can't hear myself talking. * Pressure: I wear glassed and the Pioneers get quite uncomfortable a couple hours into a gaming session. &#x200B; So now I am looking for the following: Budget: Around the $100 / 100€ mark, ideally cheaper. Max 150€. Source: 3.5mm audio jack Sound: neutral &#x200B; Should be comfortable to wear for long periods of time with soft cushions so they dont make my glass hurty :( On another thread many people were recommending the Philips SHP9500 as a good value choice, however that one is not available in Germany. Do you have any other recommendations for me?
