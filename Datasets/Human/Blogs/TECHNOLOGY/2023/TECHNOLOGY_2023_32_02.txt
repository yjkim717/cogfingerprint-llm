Problem: Need to set up fully redundant nework for NAS/SAN and Hypervisors Question: Looking for an affordable, but easy to manage switch/platform that will provide me with a completely redundant network configuration. Topology: |--------Primary Router------Switch-----| ISP Switch | X | |--------NAS, Hypervisor |---------Backup Router------Switch-----| NOTE: Routers have connections to both switches, and switches have connections between each other. This is the only way I can think to be redundant in the event that 1 switch goes down. I don't have a fully VRRP router setup, just online/standby. One router has to go down completely before the second kicks in. &#x200B; Additional Background: I have a iXSystems X20 NAS with 2 controllers running on my network. I have been running into issues where the NAS will freak out and drop all connections when there is a change on the local network (switch firmware update or VLAN changes). I am currently using a UniFi Switch Aggregation switch to connect the NAS to my ESXi hypervisors. I am hoping to solve this issue, but I am not familiar with every redundancy technology. I know I will probably need to purchase other switches, but need to know where to start looking and what other people have in their setups.
