Edit: Big Dot sells products on Buy Buy. Shoulda checked. Mods, feel free to lock. Original post follows: Context here: Might be a bit of a reach but I've seen this user around for a long time and user history seems legit. I haven't seen anybody claim they could dupe but it may have been a very brief window this behavior could be duped as the home page for Baby did appear up and down a few times. He claims to have seen "BBBY" (assuming he meant Baby) product links redirect to what sounds like this listing on this site here: I'm financially illiterate but a web developer so I have a tech clue. It's not impossible Baby got moved to somebody else's CDN and they plugged things in and it didn't go smoothly. Weird time of day to do something like that, of course, but if legit that big dot product data got rerouted to from a Baby product link, that could be a default setting for the "main site" to route to a random product listing or the first one in a table somewhere. Big Dot is owned by Altacrest Capital, a private investment firm. Looks like they might have partners with deep enough pockets. Obviously reaching here. But there's a hair's chance there might be something to this so wondering if anybody has thoughts on potential Altacrest involvment. Anything rule them out or in?
