Hi all Our environment is 1 vcenter server appliance with 2 connected vsphere hosts. We upgraded vcsa to 8, then upgraded each of the vsphere hosts to 8. All went well with no issues. The next day I upgraded my license keys and added them to vcenter. I was able to assign the vcenter and one of the vsphere hosts the new version 8 license. For the other vsphere host, in the vcenter inventory section the host summary details show version 8. The vsphere host admin page itself shows version 8, and the monitor connected to the physical host shows version 8. The issue is in the vcenter license management section. It shows the host as running vsphere 7. Because of this, I'm not able to assign the vsphere 8 license. I also want to add that there is a message showing on the vsphere host admin page stating I'm running ESXi in evalutation mode. This leads me to believe the issue is with vCenter and not the host (I do stand to be corrected thought!). I'm really not sure what to do at this point. Before purchasing and opening a support ticket, I thought I'd check to see if anyone here has any advice. Thanks in advance. &#x200B; &#x200B; EDIT/UPDATE: I performed the update from 7 to 8 on Nov 22nd, upgraded my licenses with vmware on the 23rd. I signed into vCenter Nov 28 and the second server was showing as running on an evaluation license. I was able to assign the version 8 vsphere license, so all seems to be good now. If I had to guess, I'd say thE vcenter checked in with vmware and since the version 7 license was upgraded to 8 and no longer valid, it auto switched to read the host as using an evaluation license which then allowed me to assign the version 8. I could be totally wrong with that guess, but I hadn't done anything to vcenter or the host since the 23rd. &#x200B;
