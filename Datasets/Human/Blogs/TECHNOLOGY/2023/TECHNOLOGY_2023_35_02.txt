Anyone read this? I’m sure it’s obvious, but this is a great companion piece to Gravity’s Rainbow. Not in terms of World War II but more the merging of sex and machine and the indelible impact of images. A wild piece of fiction that reads like Pynchon imitating Burroughs. I feel like Mumbo Jumbo, The Atrocity Exhibition, Didion’s The White Album, Disch’s 334, and Gravity’s Rainbow are the best books of the 70s. Any others I should check out? Still need to read the Illuminatis Trilogy.
