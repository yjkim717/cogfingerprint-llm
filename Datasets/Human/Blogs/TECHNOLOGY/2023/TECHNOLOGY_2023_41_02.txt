I am currently hard stuck in W3 (low accuracy and defense at the snakes) and decided to pour all my gains into Alchemy and Stamps. I'm at the point where brewing new bubbles is a waste of brews atm due to not having the resources to level up my highest tier bubbles. So, i've been boosting. My question is, what should I prioritize for my boosts? I've been mainlining Speed and Cost. Also, could someone explain what "2x Brew" does. Does this apply to only getting new bubbles, or everything?
