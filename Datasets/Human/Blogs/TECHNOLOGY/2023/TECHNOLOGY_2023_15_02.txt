Yesterday, I was going to drop some items to a friend so he could mule them to another character but no matter what we tried, he couldn't see my sign and I couldn't see his sign. He accepted the usage agreement. We set a password, made sure we had the correct settings and used the DUELIST'S FURLED FINGER to place the sign. We also used the FURLCALLING FINGER REMEDY to discover signs. What are we doing wrong?
