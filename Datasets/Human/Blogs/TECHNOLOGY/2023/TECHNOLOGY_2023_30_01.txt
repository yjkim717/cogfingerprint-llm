I recently toured a rent-stabilized apartment and wanted to apply for it. However, I got a text from a broker saying that someone is ready to pay an 18% fee (compared to 15%, which was the initial deal) and while it's not required, they're checking to see if I'll increase the bid. Ngl, it pissed me off a little bit. Are they even allowed to charge the applicant extra? Anything at all I can do in this position or I pretty much would have to pay extra to get a chance at the apartment?
