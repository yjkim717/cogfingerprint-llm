So i ordered a phone with smart Pay. $30 a month. I read each screen. On each screen it said "pay today $30" Well when I finished it suddenly charged me the full price of the phone, $800. I called them and straight talk says they can't cancel the order. They said I can only refuse the delivery and a refund will be processed in 30 days. That is absolute bullshit and a terrible business practice. What a way to run a company! My bank says they can only "dispute" the charge after its completely posted. Anyone found another way out of this? I already talked to 2 supervisors.
