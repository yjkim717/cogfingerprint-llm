Hi! My two kids (16 and 13) and I would like to canoe the Yukon from Whitehorse to wherever (not sure we'd make it to Dawson). We'd be flying in in late June, so we'd need an outfitter who can supply pretty much everything we need. Does this exist? And if so, any recommendations? We've canoed a bit in the past, and this is a dream we've had for a long time. Thank you.
