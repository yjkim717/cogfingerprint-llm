Hi /r/copenhagen I have been signed for KAB and AAB, among others, for about 1 year. I signed up for *everything* in the Hovedstaden and beyond, not just Frederiksberg. My only criteria was it needs to have a roof. When I open Bolig√∏nsker on both sites I am realising that my waiting list positions for pretty much all of their apartments are four-digit, sometimes five-digit (that's 10000+) and the waiting time is 20+ to 30+ years. And I am myself in my early 30s. I will be getting the renewal receipts soon. What's the point of renewing these for me? I understand that given enough time I can maybe eventually get some offers from the smaller, lesser known housing companies, and surely on the outskirts, but these big ones seem hopeless for someone in my position. So before I cancel and throw away the first little year of my anciennitet, am I missing something? Will I regret choosing to save the 200 kr on each renewal now, instead of staying signed up just in case? My uh-oh moment was when I was talking to my friend and I said oh look they have such a nice system, one can live in Copenhagen for relatively cheap, you don't have to deal with landlords and the whole thing is predictable and reliable. He then asked me how long is the waiting time and when I said 20-30 years he just laughed. I think he's right. If I pay for this thing every year for 30+ years and get *something* when I'm already pushing 60, the joke is on me.
