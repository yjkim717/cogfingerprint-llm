I managed to land an interview to be a PhD student in neuroscience program. All of the professors that are going to interview me are at the intersection of neuroscience and engineering. I'm a bit stressed about these interviews, so I'd like to ensure that I communicate to them how I think our research interests align. Since I'm not sure I can trust myself to articulate this succinctly and clearly, I want to convey this in writing. So, would it be fine if I email these professors a paragraph or two to convey how I think our research interests align? Thank you! EDIT: I appreciate all the feedback! I'll follow the general will of the sub and wait until my interview to talk about how I see my research interests aligning with my interviewer's
