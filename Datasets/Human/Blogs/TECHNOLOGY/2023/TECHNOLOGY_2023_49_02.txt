I feel like there may not exist a perfect set of earbuds for me. I want all the features in the title, but haven't found one that meets all of them. I need an over-ear design because normal earbuds always fall out of my ear sooner or later (frustrating). By "turns on/off automatically" I mean that it has a sensor such that when you take them off, they disconnect from your device, and vice versa when you put them on. These are some I've found so far: Monster DNA Fit: * over ear design: ✅ * turns on/off automatically: ❌ * Qi chargeable case: ✅ * high quality mic: ? &#x200B; Powerbeats Pro * over ear design: ✅ * turns on/off automatically: ✅ * Qi chargeable case: ❌ * high quality mic: ✅ &#x200B; Airpods Pro * over ear design: ❌ * turns on/off automatically: ✅ * Qi chargeable case: ✅ * high quality mic: ✅ &#x200B; O'Keefe Wireless Earbuds * over ear design: ✅ * turns on/off automatically: ✅ * Qi chargeable case: ✅ * high quality mic: ❌ &#x200B; I currently have the Powerbeats Pro and the O'Keefe ones. The Powerbeats Pro are very nice in every aspect except that the case can't be charged wirelessly. The O'Keefe ones are like a cheap version of the Powerbeats but actually has some things that are better. The case is a smaller (easier to carry around) and is wirelessly chargeable, and I like the material of the over-ear arc part (of the earbud) better. It is less stiff, more wobbly, which to me makes it feel a little easier to put on while still never feeling like it's going to fall off. The only downside is that the mic is kind of crappy. I did a mic test for both and the Powerbeats beats it by quite a bit (the test recordings were louder and overall sounded a lot better). I prefer higher-end headphones with good sound, customizable ear tips, noise cancellation, quick pairing with iPhone like the AirPods or Powerbeats, etc. Also I prefer dark colored ones, not white or anything (I found out AirPods can be painted with this company www.colorware.com/) Price doesn't really matter to me as long as it's not more than about $400.
