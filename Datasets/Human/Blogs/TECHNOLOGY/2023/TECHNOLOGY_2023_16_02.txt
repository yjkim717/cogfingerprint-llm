Judging from EA, is lockpicking worth it? Do you think is worth tweaking one of your characters to be able to successfully open chests, and doors even when difficult? OR there is always a way to open them anyway? Having a character for that feels a bit a waste... unless I can get items/equip i won't get without a good lock opener. PS: Also, am I right saying you either need "sleigh of hands" OR good dext?. Asking as not sure I want a rogue in my party
