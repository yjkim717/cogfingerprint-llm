Fingers and toes crossed I might have a paper accepted at ICLR, and I'm wondering how much I can add/change in the camera ready version. Typos and exposition for clarity, I assume are fine to add/change. And in some cases I have seen meta-reviews say "please address comments XYZ in the camera ready version", so I assume there is a lot of leeway. But in the absence of such a comment or comments in particular about something you should change, is it okay to change/add stuff? And if so to what degree (while keeping to the page limit).
