Hello Like the title says it, are there any active subwoofers that also have built-in amplifiers for outputing to 2 speakers? Or 5 speakers for surround sound? Basically so you don't need an AV receiver. Long story short, I have a Logitech Z906 currently and want something else, but don't have the space for a receiver, so I was searching if there is any sub with an integrated AV receiver basically (optical/HDMI inputs, speakers amp outputs etc).
