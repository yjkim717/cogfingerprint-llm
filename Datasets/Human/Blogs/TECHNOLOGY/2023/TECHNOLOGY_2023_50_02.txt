Hi, there. I live in a small community and I've been chatting with someone online. Chances are we know each other but our profiles are hidden behind screennames without any picture. It's getting time to reveal ourselves and we've been talking about how to do it fairly without someone getting ghosted. The suspense is killing me to find out who they are but my question is: Is the some website out there that can help us reveal each other at the same time? Like, I would submit my name and photo and when they do the same the other person would be revealed? Thanks for any help people!
