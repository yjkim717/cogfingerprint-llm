Being a bit of a left-center myself, I always feel shame when anti-capitalists start talking shit at me when I'm doing self-promo (in appropriate places, respecting the community, showing up authentically, etc). Recently, I've been dealing with a question I never really had to ask myself, "how the fuck am I going to feed myself this week?" How do you deal with anti-capitalists when all you're trying to do is **literally** eat? I have $0 in savings and I'm not even bothering to declare bankruptcy because I know I'll just restart the whole thing years later. I don't even know if I'll be able to retire. If I can live month-to-month I consider myself lucky. I really am trying my best to stay positive, keep going, etc. Been doing this for 5 years and the only other option is to just live with my parents, abandon my wife/life and let society shuffle me away. Ain't fuckin happening.
