Hi everyone, I know the economy's bad, but I've been hired to work as a software engineer for a big tech company that says it's all about accomodations. But they won't approve the headphones I need in order to work. I require good noise cancelling headphones. They cost $250/£200. These are what I need to be able to do my job. I have tried other things. I recived my current pair as a gift and when I wear them or them plus earplugs I am okay and can function. Otherwise I cannot. My current pair is falling apart and not workplace-appropriate. It is costing me thousands of $/£ to get a visa and move to this new country to take the job. I received no signing bonus or relocation. I need the headphones to do my job. How can I communicate to my employer that I am disabled and this is a big accessibility issue?
