I have lived in London for many years, it is a great city in atmosphere and I generally love it. But when looking at the housing market, I can't shake the feeling that buying a flat in London is a complete scam for the average person. Let's say I want to buy a standard 2-bed flat in London somewhere in zone 2 or 3. Then I'm probably looking at a small £400k leasehold property with a service charge. Let's use this flat as an example So let's say I save up and manage to get a £100k deposit together. This is a **huge** amount of money and it would take even successful people many years to save up this much money. So that brings the flat down to £300k which I now need to borrow from the bank. At the current rate, with a standard 25 year repayment plan, the mortgage repayment would be around £1850 a month. Now the service charge + ground rent will cost us an additional £5,750 a year (or £480 a month). That now brings our expenses to a lovely £2,330/month not including council tax or any bills - even though we have already sunk a whopping £100k into the property (which evidently also needs some renovation work in the bathroom and probably other rooms too). Also consider the fact that the service charge will most likely only continue to go up each year. Even when renting, you can generally get a nice 2-bedroom apartment for £1,750 in zones 2-3 (I recently moved into a flat for this price) - it's still expensive but at least not as ridiculous as £2.3k. I thought mortgage repayments were meant to be cheaper than renting! And I am aware that the £5.5k service charge is particularly high. But realistically, most flats I've seen will also range between 2k-4k and continuously go up over the years. To me this just feels like a complete scam to even a successful person. Maybe as some multi millionaire this would make for a nice accommodation for my student son, but how is this feasible in any way for most people? Am I missing something?
