Hello, The title may look paradoxical, but it is not. I use Assugrin as a sweetener in coffee, bakery, etc. However, the tablet form is very condensed (200 times sweeter than sugar the same weight?) and hence very difficult to adjust when baking, cooking usually resulting in some parts of the cake being very sweet and the other parts bitter! Liquid Assugrin is good and solves this problem, but I can not use liquid everywhere, e.g. in making chocolate bars. Now, is there a sweetener that, (1) has around the same "density" as sugar, (2) zero carbs, like Assugrin, and (3) available in powder form? Many thanks
