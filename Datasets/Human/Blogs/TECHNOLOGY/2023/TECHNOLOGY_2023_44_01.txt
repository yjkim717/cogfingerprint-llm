Hi, About 3-4 years ago I was diagnosed with a 4cm sliding hiatus hernia. This was off the back of experiencing chronic heartburn, which was resolved by consuming omeprazole (20mg per day). The hernia was found through an endoscopy. This week I had a follow up because I've been getting sore throats every morning for the last 9months. Anyway, they concluded that I have a sliding hiatus hernia of 2cm as a result of this. How is this possible? I'm looking for a rational explanation because I was told hernias can't fix themselves, but this movement from 4cm to 2cm implies they could potentially heal. Can anyone provide some insight here?
