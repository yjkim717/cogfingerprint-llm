**TL;DR** — Once Tara Kinesis sells out (or by February 1, 2024 if it sells out faster than I think it will), I'll be releasing a full downloadable book to download for free for everyone. **Holders** get a special edition download copy that include the below certificate, along with a print version available for purchase during a limited time (that will be disclosed here and on the official website when the time comes, the prints can be ready immediately prior to book release). For the latest up-to-date info, why not join the exoSages Discord? **Check out some teasers below!** &#x200B; Prototype of first spread of the mentioned book Sample of the mentioned extra for holders. Foil will look different since a real foil effect will be used in print. **Long version:** # It Begins with an Impetus Tonight, I did another stand up comedy set at a weekly open mic show. It was a wonderful show. Only the MC, me, and another comic showed up. And, while neither of us are pro, we handled our time like headliners and the audience loved it. Prior to the show, I asked a greater power ("the universe," "god," whatever it may mean to you) for a story based on a premise. The premise is based on the fact that I hallucinated the number 10 and 23 last night after dealing with poor sleep. After the show, I hung out with the MC and other comic. When the MC left, I asked the comic to join me at the roulette table where I put $5 on 10 and I asked them to put $5 on 23. We play only one round, a cheap way to make what I thought was a delusion go away. I thought the delusion was that the greater power would be so willing to provide a story I crafted and make it happen with real characters and a real setting (me, the other comic, and the casino). The ball spun and I lost. The comic, on the other hand, had their $5 turn into $180. We walked away. I refused to take any of the money because I got what I wanted. The story. # The Story of Stories Continues After Divine Affirmation All this is to say that I have been told by forces beyond me in a clear and striking way that my purpose right now is to continue to craft stories. For people in my everyday like with the comic, and for people like you — through Tara and my other pending avatars. I am teasing page one of a story about Tara Kinesis, a story that is near completion. It saddens me to not engage with the community as much as I'd like to, but at the end of the day, I am at my best spending most my time being prolific with what I think are truly fun and relatable characters, relatable stories, and the art and technology to make these stories flourish. The story is in a children's' book format, though with complex adult themes. That said, my hope is that the story resonates with everyone. I will tease more pages in the future, and release the book in digital format once Tara has sold out 100% (or February 1, 2024 if they sell faster than I anticipate them to). The story will be free to download for all, but holders will get an exclusive download with a certificate from the story. This certificate will be available for purchase in physical format to said holders during a limited time. # Disclaimers Delays on release of the book may be affected by when my other avatars are released in order to comply with Reddit rules about spoilers. Delays on shipment of the certificates for holders may be affected by shipping times, your geographic location, and geopolitical turmoil I have zero control over. I always deliver, so please reach out to me personally on my official contact methods before leaving a stinky review somewhere. The book contains topics and themes related to my life, my experiences, my schizophrenia, and general shitty things that can happen IRL (though I tie it all off with a silver lining and hopeful conclusion) so it's safe to just slap a broad "Trigger Warning" on the entire piece.
