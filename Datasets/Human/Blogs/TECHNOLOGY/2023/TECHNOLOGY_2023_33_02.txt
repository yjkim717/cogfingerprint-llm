After the system is on for some time, the filesystem on my main partition becomes read only. fedora is the only os isntalled on my system and fast boot and sec boot is disabled in bios.some forum posts i found on places like stackexchange say that it may be because of a bad drive or because its being unmounted or remounted weirdly. smartctl returns a passing smart test result from the drive and ive tried running `sudo mount -o remount rw /` but that returns with / being a bad or invalid mount point (or something similar). i ahve tried running `btrfs check /dev/nvme0n1p3` from my ventoy usb that had fedora, returned with no errorshere is the smart report of my drive: and dmesg logs: (dmesg), (journalctl)hw probe: edit: Now it seemingly doesnt do it anymore, been up for a good 15 mins, which is much longer than previously which wouldnt last til 5 mins. ive been having syncthing run in the background to help sync my files and now it is done syncing. i no longer get errors in the syncthing web gui saying that i lost connection for now. still need to check whether or not the system will go read only after suspend. edit 2: ive had the system on pretty much the entire day, today. most of the time was spent on suspend as it was in my bag most of the time. didnt go read only. it seemingly fixed itself? i cant tell. my issues always seem to persist until i start bitching about it on forums and they fix themselves.
