Hey all, I'm a Londoner moving to a new area in a few days. I have to leave my current place on short notice so I tried to find a new flat as soon as possible. I found a pretty good place and managed to get my offer accepted. Now I'm moving in a few days so I'm trying to get the internet sorted. For context, I work full-time remotely (zoom meetings, lots of tabs open, etc) and use the internet all the time. To my surprise, all the broadband deals in my area are terrible ranging from 6-11 mbps! With that speed, I doubt I will even be able to browse the internet with comfort, let alone perform my full time job. I thought that surely if I pay more, I'd be able to find a provider with at least 60 mbps. No luck so far. I have submitted this post on another sub and had a few people suggested 5G wifi (I believe the term is MiFi). I've never looked into this before, so if anyone can provide more context on whether this is actually viable as a remote worker and what other options are available to be now it will be much appreciated.
