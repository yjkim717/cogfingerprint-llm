\*\*AD-AAD - Won't let me edit the title lol &#x200B; Morning everyone, I've been seeing a lot of the same issue lately. People just get their accounts locked constantly. Sometimes I wonder if it's related to a password change and sometimes I think it isn't. In today's world we have: * Windows * Outlook * Word * Teams * Excel maybe * Edge * The OneDrive app, if you use it * Email/Teams/Office on your phone * Web apps for any of the above * Hundreds Admin centers for admins All of these things are trying to verify your MS credentials at basically anytime. For example, I changed my password last week. Almost every day, when I get into work ( And sometimes in the middle of the work day ), when I try to unlock my computer, it just says my account is locked out. I'm not entering the PW wrong, and I'm not trying more than once. I don't save my passwords anywhere in Windows because that's just a horrible practice. So I don't have a clue why my account keeps getting locked.. today, after being out of the office for 4 days, I come in, and my account says locked. I also have users who have not changed PW recently getting the same things happen to them. We're a small organization, but myself and the other IT person are pretty decent. Also, our MSP doesn't have a clue what can be causing this. Has anyone else seen anything like this?
