Hi all ðŸ‘‹, Here is the newest and latest update Starlite - the blazingly fast ASGI API framework! First off, we got a new logo, new docs and our own domain - check it out at The big news is that we are working hard on releasing v2.0, for which we plan to release a first Release Candidate in early March. V2.0 will introduce a lot if improvements and additions, with some highlights being: 1. SQL Alchemy 2.0 Support. 2. Rewritten DTOs 3. Improved Performance 4. A builtin event bus and "signals" 5. HTMX support 6. SAQ support 7. Improvements to caching and sessions And more! We decided upon our long term versioning strategy - Starlite will adhere to strict Semver, which means no breaking changes except in major versions. And we will release major versions more often (at least once a year if not more). We will keep the last minor version of the previous major version as a maintenance version. Thus, v1.51.* is now a maintenance version, and it keeps receiving bug fixes and dependency updates 1.51.5 is the current patch). The other news is the discord server, which got a major overhaul. We now have 3 moderators who maintain it. As always, we welcome contributors of all kinds. Join us on discord or our GitHub.
