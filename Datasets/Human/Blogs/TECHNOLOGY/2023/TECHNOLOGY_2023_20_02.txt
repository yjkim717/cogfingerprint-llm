Hi guys, I’m a 23F person who has been dealing with severe anxiety and a myriad of other health issues the past 5 months. I’m still dealing with horrible symptoms from unknown causes, but something that’s bothering me a ton is my cyst removal surgery tomorrow. I’m afraid. Very afraid. Abnormally afraid. I keep thinking about the pneumonia that the pre-op nurse gave me items to prep in order to avoid, the complications that could arise, me maybe having some horrific sickness that has been causing all of these tingliness/pins and needles, joint, back & head pains + the weakness that they’ll find during surgery, and to top it all off, I have a cold that’s making me have a stuffy nose and sore throat that’s probably gonna call off the surgery I waited weeks for. How does anyone cope with these thoughts? Especially those who KNOW they have limited time on this planet anf with their loved ones because of some illness or anything that just makes this f*cking life thing suck so much until the bitter end. I’m struggling mentally, and honesty don’t know how I’m gonna cope tomorrow.
