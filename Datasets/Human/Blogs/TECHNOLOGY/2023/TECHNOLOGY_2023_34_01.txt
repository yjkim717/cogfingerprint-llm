Mid 30s. Relatively healthy other than my LPR diagnosis. Last November scoped and found 2cm hiatal hernia. Absolutely no damage to esophagus but ENT consistently sees inflammation higher. Also had allergy test and big time dust mites allergy. I've been on various dosages of Omeprazole with some success but also still had flare ups during that time. Was up all the way to 40mg 2x day for awhile. Had a bad flare up in early July so started Gaviscon Advance then. After every meal and before bed. Been doing that since. Still issues sometimes. Breakfast and lunch are usually very light. Oatmeal with apples for breakfast like 6 days a week. I am working to cut out alcohol entirely. But down to maybe 2 days a week. I cut out coffee 2 months ago. Switched to a small cup of green tea. Might cut that out too. I try my hardest to eat early but we have 3 little kids so a hectic schedule makes that hard. Especially when the toddler has us exhausted. Example. Friday night we had activities so had a later dinner at 630. Salmon, rice and veggies. But I had 2 beers with it. Was in bed by 9. Bad idea, I know. Yesterday was bad and today even worse. Constant pain, hoarseness, choked on thick mucus earlier, constantly clearing throat. Exhausting. Painful.
