Very late to the game, but I was a bit busy with some other commitments first semester and unfortunately didn't start looking till now. I'd really like to find a cs internship at the summer, hopefully at a startup for better experience. Solid in python and java, know HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS and C++. Previous admin-related job experience. Any advice for where I can look?
