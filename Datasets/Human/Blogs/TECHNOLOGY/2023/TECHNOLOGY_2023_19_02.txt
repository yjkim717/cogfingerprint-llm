Having just got to episode 109 it's absolutely glorious and hilarious to see the prank against Scanlan. Also kudos to Sam Riegel for taking that on the chin. That would be very easy to have accidently meta-gamed but he leant into it, making it one of the most funny segments of campaign 1 thus far I'm aware that the cast all know each others boundaries but still have to applaud Sam for his willingness to go full horny bard mode on Percy, especially given that Vex and Percy are married by this point
