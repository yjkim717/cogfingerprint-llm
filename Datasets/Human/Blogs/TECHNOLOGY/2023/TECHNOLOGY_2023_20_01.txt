Hi all, I’m back on Reddit to just beg someone to help me make sure I’m looking in the right places here. I’ve been very sick for the last 3-4 months with brain fog, pressure, headaches, SEVERE malaise, body aches, lethargy, weakness, pins and needles down both arms and legs, cold feet, eye pain, chest pain, and nausea. I feel like someone hit me with a baseball bat and that my brain is gonna explode. My vital signs are always normal, blood tests are normal, & MRI/CT/X-ray all normal. I’m at my wits end. I legit hate being awake sometimes bc of how much suffering I’m in. I’m anxious 20/7 that im probably gonna just croak, and I’m depressed the other 4/7 and think I should just end the suffering myself since almost all of the medical professionals I’ve seen, don’t really care and think that I’m just complaining for nothing. I don’t drink or smoke. I legit don’t overdo any physical activity, and I was not as stressed before this as I am now.
