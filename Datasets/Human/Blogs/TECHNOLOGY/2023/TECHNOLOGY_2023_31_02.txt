Thinking about building an app and would like to build with a microservice architecture (MSA) but there is a lot of overhead for a small team. Thinking it is best to start with a monolithic architecture (MonoA) that will eventually be migrated to an MSA. How can one build a MonoA such that migration to MSA is as smooth as possible?
