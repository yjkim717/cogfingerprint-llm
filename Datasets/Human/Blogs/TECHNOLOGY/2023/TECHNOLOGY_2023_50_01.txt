Hi, I'm trying to mess around with Solfeggio frequencies. I have a nice lush pad sound from a midi track using Vital synth, a bunch of EQ and reverb. So my question is, how can I modify the pitch of a midi note to match something like 528Hz or 423Hz? I can find a pitch option in a audio clip but not in the midi note editor, and even that it only does semitones. Thanks for any help. BTW I'm trying to do this in Ableton Live Lite. ðŸ˜¬
