I’m pretty into home networking and home lab stuff. My current setup consists of prosumer/dated enterprise equipment and while I’m no means a pro, I consider myself to be decently knowledgeable for my level about hardware. However I’ve come across a pretty tricky problem. I’m moving out of my parents place now for school and leaving my lab behind. My new place does not come with WiFi or internet and it’s up to me to come up w that stuff. My problem is, all of the hardware I’m knowledgeable about is 10x overkill for what I need now. I’m getting Fios so I don’t need a modem, but I am considering getting my own router since ISP hardware *generally* is pretty shite. All I need in a router is just a decent AP (I would consider an independent AP), maybe a couple standard ports, but mostly just reliability. The last place I was at for school had the shitty router+modem our ISP gave us and it crashed once a day. I just want something that will work, and is relatively affordable. Any specific brands/products I should look for/avoid?
