Hi, There is not much to add to the title, except that I'm actually fine with non-Chromebook devices as we can now run ChromeOS Flex etc... on them. There is Asus VivoBook L210, but it has unfortunately a HD screen. Lenovo Duets are great, but they have Kickstand. So, is there anything that is also not a premium price? Thanks a lot
