In PW, Takahashi had plans for 6 episodes. Part 5 being XG's timeline with some flashbacks from prior episodes. Does anyone know what Takahashi's plans were for XS? I know he wanted 6 games--was that supposed to be respective to each episode? And since the game was cut short to 3, for anyone familiar with the story, what 'episodes' as described in PW did Xenosaga end up covering?
