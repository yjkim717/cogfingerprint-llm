5k hours into CSGO. Used to play a lot of HS and pistol HS DM so pistol rounds in CSGO felt natural to me. I could reliably do flicks to re-adjust on someone who is counter-strafing and ADAD-ing. Now that we switched to CS2 sub-tick, BRO I CAN'T HIT ANYTHING AT ALL. I have no confidence in my flicks at all, be it a pistol or a damn rifle. AWP flicks are still okay, but I feel like the muscle memory required for CS2 is absolutely different. It's even compounded by the amount of body sway that the character models have in this game, it makes it hard to even track and let alone figure out if they counter strafing. Now, regarding the sprays, I admit I used to rely on my sprays as my go to if my first shot wasn't on the guys head. However, even then, the spray was more consistent in CSGO and I could reliably adjust the spray so that its easier to let the recoil get to their head. For CS2, it FEELS like the variance or spread of each spray is WAY larger than its supposed to. I jumped on Recoil Maps with nospread off, and the muscle memory I have for CSGO spray is not translating well into CS2. All the bullet holes I see when I spray on the wall are larger, and not as compact as it used to be. What exactly is wrong with me? Or is this an issue that's affecting other people as well?
