I am an avid fan of History and therefore, play a lot of geo-political historical games such as EU4, CK3 and HOI4. One thing that stood out to me the most was the superiority of European Military over that of other regional powers such as the Chinese, Indians and Native Americans. Was it really the case that superior military technology allowed them to dominate and roll over other major nations in other continents? Or was there something else? I've read from other sources that the reason for the inferiority of other major powers in other continents was the lack of territorial conflicts going on compared to that of Europe (which was just a bloodbath in general), thereby limiting innovation due to the lack of competition. Would appreciate if anyone can enlighten me on this particular topic!
