I'm trying to understand the mathematical underpinning of linear regression, which obviously includes basic calculus rules. As someone without a strong math background, I'm having a little difficulty with basic calculus; however, I've been reading a few books and articles and watching tutorials to get a better grasp on some of the basic concepts. &#x200B; In the example I'm looking at, we have a simple cost function: sum(yi - (mx + c)\^2)--the "real" value minus the prediction of the line squared. Now using calculus, we would use partial derivatives to find the derivative for m and for x, the slope and y-intercept. &#x200B; Using the power rule, my initial understand was to take the \^2 and move it to the front, subtracting from the exponent, which would be 2\*(yi - (mx + c). However, the example has that but multiplied by -xi. Looking further into the chain rule, this make sense using the following as an example: &#x200B; Using the example above for the example I'm looking at, where do we get (\* -xi)? yi - (mx + c)\^2) --> 2 (yi -(mx + c) \* -x because the 't' in this example is not the slope m but x, which itself is negative because of yi? From there, we move the (\*-xi) to the front like the power rule again, which makes it positive? so the derivagtive is -2/n\_samples \* xi (yi - y\_hat)? Furthermore, how do we get y - y\^hat as the derivative of C? I feel like I'm close but I'm missing a crucial piece. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
