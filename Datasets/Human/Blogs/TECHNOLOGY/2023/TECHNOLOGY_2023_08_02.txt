Hi everyone, I have a new professional corporate job and joined the employee group for disability. I am attending their first event online. It seems to be all allies and me. They said it was a safe space but are recording it. I don't feel that makes it a safe space. I would like to ask questions at the end and am not sure what to do. Any input would be welcome! I've been disappointed in the employer response to asperger's and feel like this is the first forum I've found, but it's probably just another example of all words and no substance and I should observe and bow out quietly. Thanks. :)
