Current party is a Swords Bard, Stars Druid, and melee battlemaster. I'd prefer a more supportive/battlefield control playstyle. Edit to add: I think it'd be fun to play him as paranoid and conspiratorial that some vague god is out to kill him. Bonus points if you can work that in. Edit 2: Copy pasting a lower comment for little more context (TLDR played aaracokran artificer artillerist and a lizardfolk 1 order cleric/10 divine soul sorcerer) "Both were in big boss fights. The most recent was against an aboleth. My 1 Order Cleric/10 Divine Soul sorcerer had twinned a protection from evil and good on our druid and fighter. Boss didn't like that, so he focused me down in an attempt to break my concentration. However, this character had warcaster, 18 con, and proficiency in constitution saving throws, for a +8 with advantage. He never broke my concentration until I was down. By the time I went down, the party figured the boss was almost dead and decided to focus it down, but the dice weren't in our favor. Initiative order was unfortunate because I went right after the boss, so party would drop a small heal to keep me up, then the boss would knock me right back down. First one was just an insane damage roll on an ancient dragon's breath attack that basically oneshot my squishy artillerist. Still kinda mad about that one"
