I’ve seen various rules of thumb about spending no more than ~30% of your gross income on a mortgage. But this strikes me as somewhat useless information. For example, what if I have particularly high or low monthly expenses? What if taxes in my area are much higher or lower than average? What if I pay more for insurance than most people? Or if I just financed a new car? Etc. What is actually useful is the following question, which I haven’t been able to find a good answer to: what percent of your net income (after taxes and all non-housing related expenses) should go towards housing expenses (that is, mortgage+utils+property tax)?
