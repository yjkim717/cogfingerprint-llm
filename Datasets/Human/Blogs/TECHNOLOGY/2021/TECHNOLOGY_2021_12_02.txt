So, whenever I have an occupational task, be it work or university, *before* starting it feels to me like a large, immovable metal cube that I will never nudge from where it stands and I feel defeated, leading to procrastination. Afterwards, when I actually decide to tackle the task, I am struck with guilt arising from the fact that its completion took me so long, even though it is often trivial, e.g. a routine task or something nonetheless very easy. This vicious cycle is costing me a serious amount of energy and is leading more and more to patterns of self-deprecation. Hence, my question: I understand that if I stop perceiving trivial tasks the way I do, then I would feel less guilty. This seems to me to be a matter of perspectivization, that is, of changing one's abstract position with respect to the task and seeing it for what it is. Are there some sorts of spiritual exercises (Ã  la Pierre Hadot) or meditative practices that help with this? I tried the Stoic exercise which makes you imagine to be floating in space, from where all human things seem trivial, but as soon as I stop actively picturing things this way the positive effecs go swiftly away. Thank you in advance.
