Just wanted to share a story of a time i was desperate for a job when I was also in technical school (this was about 6 years ago) I applied to a lot of different places and didn't hear back from any of them except for one job at CVS. I got dressed up in a nice button down shirt and slacks and a tie and all that, showed up early and waited a half hour to see someone. The manager takes me into his office and immediately puts both of his feet on his desk and proceeds to ask me the standard interview questions. The interview lasted about 30-45 minutes or so, which he used a lot of swears and profanity (not towards me, just the way he was speaking). Then at the very end, he told me he wasn't hiring but he liked my resume and just wanted to come in in case he wanted to hire me in the future. I was so baffled that he wasted my time for no reason that I didn't even know what to say. I just left without being rude but looking back I wish i had yelled at the asshole for wasting my time.
