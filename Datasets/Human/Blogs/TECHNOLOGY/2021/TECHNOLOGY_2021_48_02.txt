Let me be clear. Like a moron, I got in at 450 with some shares. I want to feel stupid about that but I think it was the right call given the circumstances. Then the DTCC did it's thing and buying got blocked. They mugged millions of retail investors in broad daylight. What the holy !@#$ were they afraid of? That's good DD. I added more on the way down. I added my entire Roth on the way down around $128. My fucking-around account with "some shares" at $450 would be complete garbage right now if I hadn't added a lot more when it was around $50. Thanks for that gift btw, hedgies. So yes. I am committed to this. I believe it will be historical. But what I am not committed to is these fantasy price targets people keep saying aren't a meme. That if we only hold are totally possible. The truth is nobody knows. But let's be realistic. 100k per share with 100% of the float to cover. That's trillions of dollars. If I were a president or prime minister I'd sign assassination orders to stop that from happening and I hate that shit. They could have 10 times that many shares to cover. And it's not just apes in the room. It's Gamestop who doesn't want to crush the economy. It's larger tutes who don't want all of their other positions to evaporate. And it's retailers, each individual one with their own needs and their own highly specific ideas about what is "life-changing." We are not a hive-mind. Do NOT pin your hopes to a specific price target or date. Read the best DD you can on analyzing how and when this is at the beginning of the end. And fuck these guys saying hold until X amount. They don't know. They know they don't know. And I'll sure as fuck bet they know the price they're targeting is above the one they'd gladly sell at. This could be ATH again. It could be 1k+. It could be 5k. Beyond that point, keep your eyes open but don't let anybody else tell you when the time to sell is unless you know and trust them and their DD. We ARE winning. Don't let greed fuck it up. Apes don't get slaughtered.
