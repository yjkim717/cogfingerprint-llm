I currently have $55k in cash and $66k in stocks, and am thinking about investing in rental properties. In my location (small Canadian city), I can find a rental property for $300k-$350k whose units rent for a combined $3k-$4k per month. Allotting $1k per month for maintenance expenses, accounting for tax, and assuming a 20% down payment 25 year mortgage at current rates, this type of property should generate roughly $10k per year in profit after all expenses. *So, assuming a 20% down payment of about $65k, this means it’ll take about 7 years to recoup my initial investment*. At that point, I take this $65k and reinvest it by purchasing another similar $300k-$350k property which also nets $10k/year. After another 7 years, I’ll have enough money to buy two more similar properties for a total of 4. Finally, after another 7 years, I can reinvest the profit from those 4 to own a total of 8 properties. So after the total of 21 years, each of these 8 properties nets roughly $10k/year. This doesn’t even take into account the value of my stocks, or any savings from the salary I earn during my career. Does this mean I could potentially retire in 21 years? This feels too good to be true. The only downside is that I don’t actually see any of the profits for 21 years; all of it gets reinvested. Note: I’m aware that real estate prices are not constant, but I think it is a fair assumption for the sake of this argument. This is only meant to be a roughly calculation anyway.
