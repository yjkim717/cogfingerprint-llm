I have the 2WD short wheelbase and Owner's manual says the max trailer weight is 8,300 lbs. &#x200B; Do I need to get additional items to be able to haul at that max weight? Dealer told me it has the Z82 package >Trailering equipment, heavy-duty, includes trailering hitch platform, 7-wire harness with independent fused trailering circuits and 7-way sealed connector I don't think mine has any sort of tailering break controller so will I need something like this? Anything else I need?
