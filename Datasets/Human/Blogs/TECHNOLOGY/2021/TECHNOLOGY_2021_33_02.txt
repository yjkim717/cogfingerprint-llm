Sometimes when I tab out to check spotify or discord, I am unable to tab back in. When i tab back into CSGO, it would kick me back out to my desktop. I play in fullscreen 4:3 stretched. Is there a way i can solve this? I am sorry that i wasn't able to show a vid demonstrating this but i hope my explanation can help you understand the situation.
