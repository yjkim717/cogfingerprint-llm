i'm kinda lost on how to make a good list for schools I want to go to because I don't really have any major requirements other than it having a good CS program and not being in a select few states (alabama, new york). Been using collegeVine for help, and it's showing wich ones are my safeties and targets and stuff, but i'm not sure how much I can rely on it. Would really appreciate any advice :) &#x200B; TL,DR; Don't know where to apply or where I will get in, using CollegeVine but not sure how much to trust it. Have a semi-solid list of 30ish colleges but dk how to proceed.
