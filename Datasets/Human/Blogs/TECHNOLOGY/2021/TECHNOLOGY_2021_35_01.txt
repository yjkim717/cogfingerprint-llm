I’m kind of obsessed with Barron lately. Why do the followers of Old Leech choose who they do? I understand the desire to attach themselves to Michelle (Croning), so she can conduct “research,” but why Carol and Franco (Jaws of Saturn)? If Old Leechs(?) can appear as giants capable of devouring people, why not do that and get if over with? I get that they like playing with us, but toys sometimes lose their allure.
