As soon as I found out about this switch, I had to have it. I knew a lot of things about MikroTik's environment and love the home routers. However, as soon as I got my hands on it, I found out the switch only ran RouterOS, at the time. Now it has been a while and SwOS 2.13 has been released and I want to run it. However, I am running it in production as my primary switch. Does anyone have a running MikroTik CRS354 running SwOS? Update Dec. 4, 2021: I have successfully switched the system to SwOS. It is a better interface than RouterOS, for this case. I still like the features of RouterOS, it is just clunky when it comes to managing 52+ interfaces and figuring out how to prevent VLANs from using a port (trunk to hypervisors).
