Due of covid-19 and new government rules. At my work we have to renew laptops for users to let them working at home. So we have now around 100 refurbished laptops, mostly Dell Latitude i5. The company sale them to workers (I am also a worker in company) for 50 euros. So I thought I could buy 2 or 3 maybe 4 to replace my two old laptops i3 and i5 mining monero and which got heat damage. I just bought a second ryzen 7 for mining so not enough money to buy another one but 4 laptops 50 euros each one, I am able to. Bad or good idea or soso idea?
