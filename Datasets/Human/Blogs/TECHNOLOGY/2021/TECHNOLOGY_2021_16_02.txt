Hi, I come from Divinity Original Sins and Divinity Original sins 2, so no past D&D experience.Even if I do not come from D&D I really like the game BUT I have been finding difficult to understand how proficiency works, how saving, attack, ability checks, armor class, and all the other type rolls works and WHEN they are taken into account. I haven't found any tutorial in the game, or even the logic happening behind the scenes.Unless I have missed it, please add it or make it more clear.I love play at more than classic difficulty and in order to enjoy I will need to understand how this works! PS: BUGS REPORTING Secondly, If there was and EASY way, in the game, to send feedback and bugs to Larian I could contribute. Have away to make a quick screenshot and send you a message would make it effortless :) Thank you
