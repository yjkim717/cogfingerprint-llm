I'm a foreigner and have never been to the USA. From the news, it seems like a very unsafe place. But from the same news, I would say the same about the Middle East and I went there and it was nothing like that. So, I want to get some advice for a potential tech worker immigrant: 1. Is there anywhere in the SF Bay Area that is unsafe to walk around at day or night? Does this answer change depending on your appearance? 2. Would it be recommended to carry some kind of self-defence tool/weapon? 3. How safe is it to catch public transport and is safe/reliable enough to go to/from work at all hours? I realise some answers to these questions might be influenced by COVID. I'm interested in a post-COVID context since if I went there it would not be until after COVID.
