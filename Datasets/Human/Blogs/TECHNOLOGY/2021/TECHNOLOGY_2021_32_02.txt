My company purchased a bunch of Dell OptiPlex 7080 SFF with Core i5-10600, 8Gb RAM, and 512 NVMe. These were to swap out with much older Dell OptiPlex 3020 SFF with Core i5-4460, 8Gb RAM, and 500Gb SSD. We have seen hardware failure after hardware failure of the motherboards, and there isn't a recall or advisory for this model. We know that the issue is the motherboard, but not as to the extent. Signs of the problem include: 1. All webcam feeds are glitchy. It does not matter the brand or model of webcam. 2. Soundbars and microphones suddenly disconnect or become unavailable if attached to a USB hub and in a Zoom, Webex, or Teams meeting. 3. Computer goes to sleep or low power mode and will not wake up. Requires a hard reset. 4. Computer will suddenly lock up. All graphics and information on the monitor will stay up like the computer froze. Only a hard reboot will fix it, temporarily. 5. Computer monitor(s) will suddenly go blank and the computer will boot again (may be due to automatic AC recovery in BIOS). 6. Dell diagnostics will come back clean. No faults found or the tests won't complete before it freezes or reboots itself. I have a suspicion that the root cause is the power supply for this desktop model, but it only kills the motherboard and leaves no evidence. Is anyone else seeing issues with this model of desktop? Has anyone heard about Dell fixing QA issues as of 2019? Are there any other model of Dell desktops that show these symptoms?
