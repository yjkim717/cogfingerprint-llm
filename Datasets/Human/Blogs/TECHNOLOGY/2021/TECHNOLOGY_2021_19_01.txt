I'm jotting down ideas for my villain and I've decided that I want my villain to be dark; however I'm well aware that it is very easy to make dark = edge I don't have a cohesive idea for the villain yet as I'm still planning it but I have worked out that the reason why this villain is dark is due to either having BPD or Schizoaffective. I plan for this villain to be disliked right from his introduction by killing the main characters parents in front of them (which is somewhat of a trope yes I know). I know that my villain can't have no redeeming qualities so i was thinking that as 'evil' as he may be he does have some lines he won't cross. Like he won't harm a child for example During the story I was planning on having the main character go through their own mental health issues (namely PTSD (They did witness their parents death after all) as well as some other ones like issues with anger) after loosing their battle for vengeance then have them go along to 'correct' path and try to develop so it's not just 100% flaws. As you can tell I'm going for dark and gritty but I'm also aware that if I'm not careful I can make this entire thing be Edge Lord on steroids
