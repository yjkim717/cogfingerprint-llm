Hi :) Does anyone have any experience with this? We just received out very first return from outside the eu and had to pay all the customs and fees for the return. Is there any way to avoid this as we are receiving back our own items. Thanks :) Edit: For anyone wondering or seeing the post, attaching an invoice as proof of you being the seller and marking the goods as “returns” is how you get the items back without any additional fees or customs
