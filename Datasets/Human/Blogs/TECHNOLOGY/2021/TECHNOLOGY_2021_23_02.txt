Hi /r/Denmark, I'm listening to this US-based radioshow, and they talk about news like *Razor blades found in pizza dough as ex-employee arrested* here and there. What's common each time I hear them cover a story like this is: - the way I keep hearing it, these 5 hosts are neverâ€¦ surprised at the least (and it's a large, nationally-syndicated show, so lots of stories to go through); - these crimes seem downright desperate and/or crazy. To me this is a sign of an unhealthy, unequal country (or rather, society) on many levels. So in my shower-thinking about this, I got wondering about what's the situation in Denmark. From my several times visiting, I could easily imagine issues like the above are non-existent. But surely, my understanding is limited and therefore generalised. Do you know how the US and Denmark compare on these desperation and unfairness-driven crimes? Is there some kind of a World Bank chart that you know of? (I'd be surprised to know stuff like this happens in any developed EU country, let alone the one with a mature society on one hand, and noticeable efforts to integrate anyone arriving on the other.)
