We use Jamf and I have a new M1 Macbook Pro. In Jamf I did a wipe command and while trying to wipe the disk I get the error "the volume on disk0 couldn't be unmounted because it is in use by process 0 (kernel)". I cant simply reinstall macos as there is no disk to write to presumably because the disk is marked as not writable. Any thoughts?
