Seriously looking for advice here. I set up a pie for some penny stocks, thinking they will raise over 1 year, however they're up almost 200% in the first month. This has me now thinking should I be selling encase they're punp and dump stocks, or should I hold out in the hope that by Dec 2021 they will be worth more. The stocks are tlss & abml, I also have kodal minerals which hasn't raised. What's people's thoughts on this?
