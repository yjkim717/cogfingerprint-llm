Washington, DC 20019, US. TIA. I surrendered my license plates over a year ago and since then have been receiving tickets for those plates and car that is NOTHING like the one previously registered (old one was Honda, this one is a Hyundai). I’ve been fighting with my local DMV who is adamant that this IS my car. I’ve never seen this car in my life. I’ve gone to the DMV 10 times (not an exaggeration) to try to resolve this. I’ve manually cancelled the plates at the DMV 3 times. The DMV even had me go to the police station to report them stolen (yes, stolen!!!). I have no idea what to do and have over 20+ tickets on my record now.
