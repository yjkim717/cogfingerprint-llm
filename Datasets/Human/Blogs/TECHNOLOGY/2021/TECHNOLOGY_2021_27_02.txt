My friend asked me this, kind of as a joke, but it got me thinking. My first thought is a genie warlock since a magic 8-ball would be a great genie vessel. I could also see divination or chronurgy wizard working well since they have reroll mechanics which could flavor well with it. Maybe stars druid? What do you guys think?
