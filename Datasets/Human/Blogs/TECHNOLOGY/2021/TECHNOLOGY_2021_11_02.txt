Good people of Constantiam, After being approached by several of our noble citizens to make a bid for the presidency and seeing the campaign promises at the beginning of this election season, I could no longer stand idly by while empty gestures were thrown around so carelessly. I am now stepping up as the only candidate with platform policies that are within my power to accomplish, and are not focused on controlling others. Rather, they are things I can do myself or through my leadership: If these don't make sense to you, that's okay! I am intentionally being vague so that you join me at my first of three rallies on **July 31st at 4pm PST / 11pm UTC!** For coordinates to the rally, to discuss the election with others, stay up-to-date with the newest flip flops as more endorsements to my campaign roll in, and to get more details about my platform if you miss our first rally, please join the campaign Discord server: Our first rally will have macaroni salad, a rousing speech by me, and a PvP event to send things off with a bang! Please ensure your valuables are safely stored in your echest, it may get messy! Everyone in attendance will receive a Curious Markings Wallpaper mapart â€“ containing my original hand-made linostamp art!
