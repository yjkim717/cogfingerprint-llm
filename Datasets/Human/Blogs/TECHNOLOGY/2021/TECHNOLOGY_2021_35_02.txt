It took me a decade to get back to a re-read of Ellison's Invisible Man. Loved it then, and love it now. I'm stating the obvious, but the novel has only grown in importance with the racial turmoil of the past five years. Clifton's murder and the push and pull of BLM and opposing groups, not dissimilar to the Brotherhood and Ras' group. The narrator is invisible not only because of the color of his skin but his quest for an identity outside himself, each time being betrayed. I'm still contemplating the ending, which I think suggests that the only way to live in the push and pull of an absurd world is to maintain your individuality and escape underground. Can't help but think of Leary's famous quote: "Turn on, tune in, drop out." For our narrator, the drop out appears to only be temporary. What's next, after time spent underground? To live in contradiction? To acknowledge the absurdity of the world around you?
