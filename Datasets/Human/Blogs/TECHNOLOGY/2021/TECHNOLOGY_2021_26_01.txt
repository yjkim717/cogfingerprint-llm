sold. ~~Lightly used in the office only, works great. Includes USB cable, threaded connector for use with a mic stand, desk mount, and original box. Will work out of the box in Windows 10 I believe that there is a card with a MOTU software link as well, I haven't used it. The only output is to USB. The microphone also has a mini jack in for plugging in other inputs. Looking for $95 shipped via USPS. Thanks for looking, timestamps below. Please comment first, then send a message (no chat.)
