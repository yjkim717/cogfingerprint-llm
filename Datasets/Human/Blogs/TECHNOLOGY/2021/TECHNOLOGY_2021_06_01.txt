first of all, before I get inevitably flamed I want to say that Kitboga has the best channel on all of twitch. Not only is he a genuinely good person, his streams make me laugh harder than stand up comedians and it's consistently good and it's all underlined with an awareness to scams. But he's not good at preparing for the streams. Too many times Kitboga brings up some of his coded stuff while the scammer is connected and it's broken because of some edit he did or some other reason, or his internet doesn't work. Sometimes he's able to recover but many times it ends the call because they realize he's baiting them. Before the calls start he usually spends a good 30+ minutes talking to chat so I wonder why he can't check to see if his bank and other programs work during this time before the scammer calls, or even he could do it while pretending to type out anydesk or something since they can't see what he's doing anyway before they're connected. It's such a minor complaint in the grand scheme of how awesome the overall stream is, and it's probably because I like the stream so much that I spent the time to write this out and it may not bother other people as much as it does for me, but I still wish he just did a slightly better job at preparing for the streams
