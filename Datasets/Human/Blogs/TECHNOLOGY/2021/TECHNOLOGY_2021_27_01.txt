After seeing too many Fioras, Ezreals, and Yuumis, I've gotten kind of bored with URF. What are some fun builds that aren't broken but can still hold their own? I'll share my current fave, I've been messing around with bruiser rumble, riftmaker into demonics embrace, max w. Then armor and mr items, zhonyas/banshee veil if I want more damage. The resists make you shield last longer while you're also healing from riftmaker. Makes for a pretty unkillable rumble, especially if you take exhaust or the the enemy team is all one damage type.
