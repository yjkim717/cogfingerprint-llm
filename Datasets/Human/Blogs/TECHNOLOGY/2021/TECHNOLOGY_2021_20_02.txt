TIA Hey guys, I’ve been dealing with this memory for about 45 mins and cannot figure it out. It may have been a show, movie or book (or none of the above), but this female character dreamed of having a ‘Beauty and the Beast’ inspire library and her SO surprised her with one. She was upset because she felt he was invading her dream and this was the one thing she wanted to keep to herself.
