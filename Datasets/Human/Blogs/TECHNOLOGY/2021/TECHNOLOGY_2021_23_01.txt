Hi /r/Austria, I'm a non-EU third-country national from Europe, I have recently learned about the settlement permit - gainful employment excepted and I have a few questions. - The page mentions quota as a requirement, does anyone know what exactly the quota is and how large or long is the waiting list? - Initially it lists *pensioners, financially independent individuals* as examples, but later it also mentions *profits from enterprises abroad, income from assets, savings or company shares* - so does this mean I can run a startup in the US or Czechia, or even Austria for that matter, and while collecting the profits will make me eligible, my simultaneous contributions to the startup won't be counted as employment i.e. I'm not competing on the Austrian labour market, therefore not breaking the "gainful employment excepted" requirement? - I'm seeing an alternative Start-up founders option which doesn't mention any quotas or minimum monthly income requirements. Is this correct? Or are there any? As in, I would imagine a line of oil-wealthy russians may eat up all the no-gainful-employment quota, and if the Austrian government solves this by sorting the table by the *proven income* column descending (which according to the very nature of this visa makes sense), my chances are slim because I'm not one of those, and so I should do my best with the actual start-up option instead. Please let me know if you know, or if this is a wrong subreddit to ask. Thank you!
