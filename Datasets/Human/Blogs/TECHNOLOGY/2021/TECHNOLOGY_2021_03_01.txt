Hi friends, I decided that I will change my laptop's operating system because I no longer want to suffer from the bugs, slowness and screen errors that Windows gives to any application that I install from a program. In these last days I fixed the problem of the lack of audio out of nowhere and today the laptop literally died, it stayed on the eternal startup screen. It is the last time I tried (I got tired of it you know) and like I intend to first open and get all the data and documents I have from the storage first and then safely install another operating system (I am going to install debian 9 or 10,think 10, and already worked with ubuntu but this also gives some internal input errors when booting because on my master of health needed to work on version 12.0 ). I don't know why windows always go wrong and especially when I need to use the laptop, boring thing I don't know why I insisted on it üôçüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. (at least I can use my cell phone to study) Anyway I'm going to miss the notifications I get from Outlook, this type of email has a nice look to see the messages so I would like to know how to receive the notifications and install it on Debian, so is it possible to receive outlook email notifications on debian linux?
