For some reason i always get confused about spellcasters when it comes to spells they can have prepared/known. Wizard i'm think i've finally got my head round. However my backup character in one campaign is a Bard; currently the only spells i have listed are the ones i can cast. I understand that spell slots are limited Does Bard have the same thing as Wizard where you can have more spells known than prepared? For Example my level 7 Lore Bard Currently has: Cantrips: \- Prestidigitastion \- Vicious Mockery \- Dancing Lights 1st Level \- Cure Wounds \- Tasha's Hideous Laughter \- Healing Word \- Dissonant Whisper 2nd Level \- Shatter \- Heater Metal \- Phantasamal Force 3rd Level \- Dispel Magic \- Hypnotic Pattern \- Leomunds Tiny Hut (Thanks to Lore Bard Skill) \- Fireball \- Counterspell 4th Level \- Dimension Door Can i still have additional spells known? Or is that it?
