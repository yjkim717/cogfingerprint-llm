So the paper LED on the front is flashing orange. I checked the paper tray and it's full. I have rebooted the printer and the error light went away breifly but reemerged after I attempted to redo the print job. The printer is on an older connection, one with pins in it. It's connected to a lab machine so there's no UI to update drivers onto. I checked the Lexmark webpage but did not find anything in regards to a firmware update. All firmware updates appear only appropriate for Windows enviornemnts and not loadable into the printer itself. Can anyone direct me to a firmware download link or have any advice on what might be occuring? I have pulled the tray out and found no obstructions below or inside the front covers. This might be related to something that happened earlier, we moved the printer due to an unrelated incident where someoen reported black streaks on the paper. We moved the printer and put it back afterwards though it was not unpowered or disconnected. The paper tray now has loose toner in it and leaking onto the paper in the tray itself.
