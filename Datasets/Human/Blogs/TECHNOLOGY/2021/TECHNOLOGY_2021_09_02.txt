Mostly for KotH or Zone Control. Yeah, they maybe be weak and not have strong weapons, but I barely see them pushing the circle and when it is cleared I’m the only one really capturing it and have to solo to finish capturing only to die. All I ask is to push the circle, I don’t see that when I spectate after I die. Also, don’t be the “hero” and try to frag out before capturing the circle.
