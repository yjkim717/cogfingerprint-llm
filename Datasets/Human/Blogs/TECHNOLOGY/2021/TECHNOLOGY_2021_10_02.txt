I'm going to be driving across Canada soon and I'm trying to plot my route. I'm starting from New Brunswick and working my way west. On the first day, I should be able to get to Ottawa, or at least Saint-Jerome QC. After that, I'd like to stay in Canada for the whole drive, so I'll need to spend at least two more nights in smaller Ontario cities. I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for places to stay (or places to avoid). To give you an idea, I've been looking at places like Cochrane, Sudbury, Thunder Bay, or Longlac, but I know nothing about these places. Wouldn't mind driving a couple hours out of the way if there's a way nicer/safer city to stay in overnight. Any thoughts?
