I'm a graduate student and wrote my master's thesis on the **ethics of euthanasia** (focussing on analysing proposed laws in Australia). I recently spent some time turning that thesis into a long-form video, mixed with interview footage I took from interviews with Prof Bernadette Tobin (Catholic ethicist against euthanasia) and Prof Eduard Verhagen (Dutch paediatrician who developed the Groningen Protocol for euthanasia of infants). A full copy of those interviews are also available. Hopefully it can be a helpful resource for students new to the subject. Video, titled **"Why Should the Baby Live?"**: Full interview with *Prof Bernadette Tobin*: Full interview with *Prof Eduard Verhagen*: Based on my thesis, which can be read here:
