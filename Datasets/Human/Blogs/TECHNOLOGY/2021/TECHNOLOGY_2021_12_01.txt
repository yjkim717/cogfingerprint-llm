I have a very broad question touching upon research in L3 (more precisely, Ln) acquisition. I am an academic and everyday I am working with a series of languages belonging to two broad language families, Indo-European and Dravidian. The languages in question are Italian (L1), German (L1), English (L2), Czech (L3), Latin, Greek (L?) and Tamil (L4). The first try languages come up in small talk, family discussions and the like. Also, English and German are the languages I communicate in professionally. Czech is the language I have been learning for the last 4 years and it plays a crucial role in my research (also in the form of Old Czech). Latin is ubiquitous in the texts I am reading every day, but mainly Ecclesiastical Latin, and KoinÃ© Greek is also important. Tamil plays a secondary role. I believe I am not the only one juggling with a few languages in the quotidian but I am having problems in not letting the languages overlap and slowly drive me insane by maniacally triggering the code-switching demon in my everyday speech. Plus, my SO says that I "speak in tongues" (glossolalia) while I sleep, which also pushed me to pose the following question(s): Is there research on linguistic confusion in Ln (n=>3) speakers? Are there practices or "home-remedies" (i.e. non-scientific) which some of you find helpful?
