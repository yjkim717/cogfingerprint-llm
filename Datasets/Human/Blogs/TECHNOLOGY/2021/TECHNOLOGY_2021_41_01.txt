When I play Warzone, it appears I periodically disconnect from the host when playing on the Rebirth Island map only. I can play on Verdansk just fine, but I seem to have an issue where I disconnect from the host in almost every game of Rebirth Island. Has anybody else had an issue similar to this? It is getting really frustrating.
