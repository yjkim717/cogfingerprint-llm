I used to be a decent 3.88 UW student, mostly A's with some Bs on the occasion. This semester, I got 3 As and 3 C's, which massively dropped my 10/12 GPA to a 3.62/4.02. There isn't really any major life event I can blame for this, it was just me having a hard time in school. Is it over for me? What kind of schools can I still get into, and what can I do to salvage this? &#x200B; SAT: 1470 (Planning on retaking) APs: 5 APCS (Self-studied), 5 WHAP, 5 AP CALC AB Community Classes: Bio (A), Data Structures (A) Intended Major: CS ECs: USACO Silver, Lots of volunteering, PVSA two years in a row, Founder/prez of local Toastmasters gavel club, small blog with book reviews (\~10k words, apparently that's a thing ppl look at)
