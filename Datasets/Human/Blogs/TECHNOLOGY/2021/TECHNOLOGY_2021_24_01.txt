Here me out for a sec. I'm currently MGE in MM and Level 4 in Faceit. I've played against lvl 6-8 people due to Faceit matchmaking and I seem to be able to track their movements out of corners when they wide peek and get a kill. However, in MM, I get that it's 64 tick and people swing wide a lot. But even if I compensate by holding wide from the corner. Doesn't matter if I'm using an awp or not, they just seem to zoom past me before I even have time to shoot.
