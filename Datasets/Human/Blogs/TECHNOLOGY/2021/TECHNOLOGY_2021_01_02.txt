In the latest episode Myke talked about the Tokyo Totepack and while it looks nice, I don't think it's the bag for me. I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for a should strap bag that they found good? Or, a good bag for a university student as I go back to classes in the fall and need a new bag after online classes. Any and all recommendations would be appreciated! EDIT: Sorry about the title! And I should mention I'm a computer science student just in case that matters.
