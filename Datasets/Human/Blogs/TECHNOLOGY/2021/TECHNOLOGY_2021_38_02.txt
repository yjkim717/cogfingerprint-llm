Hi, So, I may enter a neuroscience MS next Spring. The program is two years and 30 credits. 15 credits involve required coursework in the fundamentals of neuroscience, and the other 15 credits are up to me. I was thinking I could take classes in computer science / engineering for my other 15 credits. So, does it make sense to get a neuroscience MS if my plan is to get a PhD in computational neuroscience or neuroengineering?
