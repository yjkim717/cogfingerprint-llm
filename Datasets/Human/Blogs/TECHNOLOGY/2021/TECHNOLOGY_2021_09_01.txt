The chair is overall good for basic needs and such but there are two things wrong with it. 1.) **The armrests are not adjustable/shouldn't be there** When I use it, it makes me shrug my shoulders, and my right shoulder started to hurt after taking it off it the armrest and letting it down after a while, so I'll probably remove them. &#x200B; 2.) **Lumbar is too low** I either have to sit close to my desk or use a pillow so I'm always touching the chair with my back. Also the lumbar is too low and narrow. I like a more banana wave shape to my chair as I lean forward a bit. &#x200B; Overall, the chair isn't bad, but I get a bit of back pain since I sit on it for a long time and realize it hurts until I lay on my stomach. I think if you want a chair like this, it's pretty good. But If you lean forward when you sit, it's not for you as it's a straight 90-degree chair and has really low lumbar support. I'd say either buy another chair or get a lumbar support pillow for the chair. Even if you do sit straight, it can hurt after a while as this chair barely has support.
