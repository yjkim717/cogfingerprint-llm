It seems updates on VDI deployments are not in-sync with the updates available to Current Channel M365 deployments. 30866 is the best I can offer my clients on VDI. This was an October 2020 release. Am I missing something here? I have Mac / iOS clients with newer features that are now being asked for on VDI, but all I can find is the 30866 msi.
