It is launching later today. Presale already closed, sold 5000 tokens at 20$ each, 100% of funds from presale used as liquidity. Launching on Pancakeswap at the same price as in presale for a fair launch. Already at almost 1M TVL. Has a partnership with Drip: The DRIP/BEE farm will have the highest multiplier farm, and there will also be DRIP/BNB and DRIP/BUSD farms (right now DRIP is sold on an internal DEX on their site). Drip price has been going to the moon for the past 1-2 weeks, started at 3$ and now it's at 25$ and doesn't seem like it is stopping. DRIP pays 1% daily for your deposits, up to 365%. There is a 10% fee on selling and claiming, and this fee goes into the contract to pay for the 1% a day. Currently the contract which pays the 1% a day has \~769k tokens (\~77% of total supply). There are \~119k tokens in the liquidity. The total number of coins currently is 1M coins, and those two contracts have \~88% of total supply, so only 10% is circulating supply. Do the math but with a 10% fee on sells, even if all the circulating supply was sold, price will not be impacted that much. You need to join a team (need a buddy) on DRIP in order to earn 1% daily rewards, and currently there is a 10 DRIP minimum deposit which will be lowered soon.
