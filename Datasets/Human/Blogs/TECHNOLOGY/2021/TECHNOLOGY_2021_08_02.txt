I am an American software engineer who would eventually like to get a work visa to the UK. However, at my current level, the salaries are too low, so I am not looking for work in the UK. The issue is that, as a software engineer, I get a ton of recruiter messages each day. I follow up on the ones that seem promising. Software engineering is a shortage occupation, and the recruiters are reaching out to me, not vice versa. But am I violating the "no looking for work while a tourist" thing by replying to them? I already had a tricky incident when I was on a student visa and got held at the border and almost declined entry because I had misunderstood something (I have asperger's and that happens a lot!). I'm not eager to repeat that scenario. Thanks!
