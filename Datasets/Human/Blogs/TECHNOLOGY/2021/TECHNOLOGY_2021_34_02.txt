30 days straight! I tend to have lots of intrusive thoughts relating to worry/anxiety. Been doing therapy and meditation off and on since September. I really noticed a difference about a week or so in at how much a dedicated practice can make a difference. I became relaxed much earlier into each session and overall more relaxed when done.
