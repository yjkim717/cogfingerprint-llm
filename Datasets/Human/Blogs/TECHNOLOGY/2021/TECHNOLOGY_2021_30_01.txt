Pretty much the title. 23 yo m, recent grad, don't know a lot about watches yet. Want to get a good quality watch that would look good in professional/semi-professional settings. Got recommended Gshock GST-B100, but heard some mixed opinions about it after doing some research. Any information and/or suggestions would be appreciated!
