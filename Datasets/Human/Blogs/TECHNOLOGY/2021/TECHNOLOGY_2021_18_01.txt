Hi all, Total noob questions. We have a 2811 router still in use. Client doesn't have budget to upgrade just yet. I've suggested purchasing a used 2811 to have on standby incase of failure for the existing. The production router is running ios 12.4. The backup router will come with version 15. I can't seem to find version 12.4 to download anywhere. Is it even possible? My question is, if I apply the running config from the production router, am i likely to run into issues because the backup router will have a different ios? Thanks in advance.
