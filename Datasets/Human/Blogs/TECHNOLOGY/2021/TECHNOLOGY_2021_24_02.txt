I usually play either banana or apps when I have the best spawn for them. Majority of the time I can take the map control and can get at least a frag in such instances. But if I don't have any spawns for these areas, I'm sort of forced to play towards mid/brackets area. I know how to smoke arches/truck side, molly cubby or quad but I just can't seem to reliably take either arches or short when I'm soloqueing. Any help guys?
