I'm building an RGB LED lamp around WS2812b strips. The lamp will comprise 16 strips of 16 LEDs for 256 LEDs in total. The strips will be mounted in a square arrangement on a 3mm aluminium plate. On the back of the plate will be mounted the power supply (switch mode, 20A @ 5V) and other components (Raspberry Pi Zero, logic level shifter and boost converter for a 12V cooling fan). Since this will be a mains powered project the aluminium plate should be connected to the mains earth. I notice that the outer case of the power supply is connected to earth and therefore when I screw the power supply to the aluminium plate it too will the earthed. The question I have is should I also connect the DC negative to earth? At the moment the power supply output is not connected to earth (I believe this is called floating) is it alright / correct to reference it to earth with a jumper cable from DC negative to earth? I want to fit a 12V fan to give a bit of air flow in the case. I have a small DC to DC converter (like the bottom left one here). My question is how to I mount this? It has no mounting holes and (obviously) it can't just rattle around in the case. I've got some perfboard that I could to isolate it from the aluminium plate but it's not clear how I would mount the boost converter to the perfboard. I have the same mounting problem with the logic level shifter but I'll just use the same solution both. Thanks.
