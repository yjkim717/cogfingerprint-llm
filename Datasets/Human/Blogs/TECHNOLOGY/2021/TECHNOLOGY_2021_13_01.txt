Hello! Bonjour! I hope someone can shed some light on, this as the Prefecture's explanation was unclear: I'm on a travailleur temporaire work visa (teaching at a uni), and went to renew it for a second year. Prior, I was on a student visa, and a visitor visa (long sejour). At none of those times was I ever asked to produce my parents' birth certificates. So I go to renew this work visa, started in June for a Sept expiration, and now the prefecture has informed me they want my parents' birth certificates, translated and apostilled, before they will continue. But, why?? It seems like somehow they've gotten the idea I asked for something other than a renewal? Or, is there a rule I'm unaware of, like, "after 3 years an expat is automatically assumed to be applying for permanent residency"? We've had a few situations where an unexpected requirement popped up, but we've always been able to discuss, understand, explain, discuss more, before the Prefecture suddenly went "Oh, ok, yeah, you don't need this thing we've asked for", so I'm hoping that with an understanding of why they want these birth certificates, I can explain why I don't fall under whatever this requirement is. At least, I assume I don't need them just for a renewal. Merci beaucoup! PS: I am hoping this isn't necessary because both parents are deceased, and I have no idea where their birth certificates are, meaning I'd have to order them and sent here, which adds to the time needed to renew, and CAF is also now waiting on my renewal!
