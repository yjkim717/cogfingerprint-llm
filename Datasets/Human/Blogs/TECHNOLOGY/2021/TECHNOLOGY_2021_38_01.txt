I'd like to pursue a masters degree in Neuroscience at the same university where I got my bachelors. To give you a quick backstory, in 2019 I graduated from a top research university with two bachelor degrees in philosophy and English. Since then, I taught English in Spain and Japan, and recently I was hired by Facebook to work as their creative writer. Although my adventures were fun and my work with Facebook interesting, I wasn't satisfied that I was living meaningfully. So, after much reflection, I decided to live for the sake of a mission: I want to help communities somehow. I believe a masters in neuroscience could help me accomplish this. My eventual goal is to get a PhD in neuroengineering or biomedical engineering to design brain-computer interfaces. I don't have a background in neuroscience. I don't have any lab research experience. But, I have many of the prerequisites the degree requires and a 3.7 cumulative GPA. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but as a philosophy major, I excelled in logic courses. I could solve logic puzzles faster than anyone else and generally, I made perfect scores. With that said, I also have the desire and willingness to do whatever it would take to get this degree and excel. My research interests center on somatic sensory/motor neurons. I don't have a research proposal at the moment, but I want to develop one as soon as possible. My question is, what can I do to get started? During high school, I took an entire semester of coursework in physiology and courses centered on neuroscience, so I have some background. Feel free to DM me if you'd like more details about the program I'm applying to. I hope the program would be easier to get into seeing as I got my bachelor's at the same university, but I'm not taking any chances, of course. This is in the United States.
