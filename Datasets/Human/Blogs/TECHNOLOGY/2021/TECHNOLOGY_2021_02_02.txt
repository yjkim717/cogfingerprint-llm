Ok so here's the story: I've been getting tired of Google lately, I feel like alot of what I loved about them 5-7 years ago has went away. I switched to Samsung a few years ago but nowadays I really like the way Apple does things best. When I switched to tmobile a few months ago, I told the lady in store I wanted to get the iPhone 12 pro max. She told me it was "backorder for months"- I got the note20 ultra. It's a good phone. But I still want the iPhone. I went back a couple weeks later and they had the phone, but it was too late to change. Also I was never offered jump or any of those special things. So NOW I'm trying to figure out how to get into the iPhone without shelling out $1000. Plus I'm already doing a device payment plan on the note20. Ideas? I used to be on an unlocked mvno and I could always buy/sell/trade my phone anytime but I gather my device is tied to my line unless I pay off the balance.
