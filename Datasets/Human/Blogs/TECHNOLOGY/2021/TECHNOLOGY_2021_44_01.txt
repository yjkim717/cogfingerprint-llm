So I've been trading for about 6-12m, and kinky losing money haha... Gotta lesrn somehow I guess. Anyway, ive been using invest and not isa. Can someone explain the difference to me or give a link that explains this. I'm wondering since I only trade around 3k if im doing the right thing by using the invest. Thanks in advance.
