&#x200B; Hello everyone, I obviously missed the July update and am horribly late for the October update, but no one seems to care if I'm late anyway, so... better late than never! Besides, there have only been 3 sales since April 5th, anyway. Here are the stats from that: $206.73 paid to my shop for Constantiam products since my last update. this translates to: $40.15 donated to PhantomCaptain/Constantiam.net after paying taxes, shipping, Printful, and Stripe. This was a significantly larger profit margin because someone bought a hoodie at full price. They didn't even use the secret coupon that I have circulating around in-game! $32.90 is the total of previous donations, bringing the grand total of donations to $73.05. When I did the audit this time, it looks like I also donated the profit from one of my Curious Markings shirts by accident, so I threw that in the gif as well. See you all in the next update! And here's the link to the shop if this is news to you: Cheers, Ian
