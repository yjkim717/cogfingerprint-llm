I just picked this up, black on black. I have a Mazda CX-9 I use for a family hauler but it gets around 20MPG. This gets around 40 so I'm using it as my daily driver. It's such a basic car but it reminds me of a 90s car, especially with the manual transmission. The fit and finish isn't too great, one of the door panels isn't secured properly and it looks like the dealer will have to fix it because i can't get it to fully secure. Other than that, I've had no issues so far, but only 180 miles driven on it. It's my first new car, I avoided the CVT like the plague, I can't imagine buying anything above the S M/T trim for this car. What sucks is that there are two trims in S, the M/T and the CVT option, despite them being the same exact car, you cannot get apple car play or rear folding seats, not even retroactively from the dealer. In total I financed 18.2k for this and I had to buy it from a dealer over 100 miles away because no one carried the M/T near me. I also noticed these cars are not selling well at all--i believe this year will probably be the last versa they make, the end of an era of cheap economy cars. i hope this things lasts, i want it to go 200k+ miles, but I've never owned a nissan before, only toyotas and mazdas.
