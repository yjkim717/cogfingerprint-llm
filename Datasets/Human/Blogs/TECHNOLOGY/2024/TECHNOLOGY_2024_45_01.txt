This stupid idea is from a dream I had today. A couple and their small 6 year son goes to a walk on the beach. The sunset was beautiful, but all of the sudden people start screaming and running. The male main character sees people being attacked by large birds that look like Pterodactyl. The couple runs for their life but in the chaos the kid is left behind. One bird has locked on the target and is going for the kid. The father, in desperation tries to grab the kid, but the bird attacks the father. The birds throws the father to the ground with the strong wings. He is able to grab a sharp shell and with a lucky strike in a critical point in the neck he kills the bird. The dead bird vanishes and drops a ring! \- What is this? He grabs the ring and feels a rush of energy through his body. Another bird attacks with the beak, but he is able to grab it with his bare hands and open the mouth until it's splinted. \- I'm so strong, what is happening? The ring, can it be... The dream ends here, but one can imagine the adventure that follows.
