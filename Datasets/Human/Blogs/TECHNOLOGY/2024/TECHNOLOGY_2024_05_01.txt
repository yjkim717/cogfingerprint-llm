My experience of buses between NYC and Ithaca is that 50% of the time I experience a significant issue. I'm wondering if this is typical or not, and/or whether there are bus companies/operators particularly known for this which I should avoid. For interest, my bus experiences have been: 1. NYC->ITH with **Trailways**, departing 6:15am from Port Authority Bus Station -- *no issues*. 2. ITH->NYC with **OurBus**, departing 7:35am from E Seneca St -- *issue:* delayed by almost 2 hours due to the original bus not being able to achieve >40 mph speeds, so had to turn around and change bus in Lansing. 3. NYC->ITH with **Flix**, departing 4:30pm from New York Midtown (31st St & 8th Ave) -- *issue:* cancelled by Flix the day before departure and automatically rescheduled to an earlier bus (without notification/warning/apology/etc.). 4. NYC->ITH with **Megabus**, departing 6pm from Port Authority Bus Terminal -- *no issues*.
