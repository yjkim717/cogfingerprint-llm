I used to work for my current company remotely from MD in 2022, but then I moved to the NY office with the official start date of Jan 1, 2023. For the 2022 tax season, I only filed the taxes for Maryland, but this year, W2 Box 15 shows "TOTAL STATE", and the form has tax information for both MD and NY, despite the fact that I haven't lived in MD for a single day during 2023. Does that sound like a mistake from my employer's side that should be corrected? When moving to a different state, I specifically chose Jan 1 as my starting date in NY to avoid filing taxes for both states. Any information is greatly appreciated!
