As mentioned in the title, I (23M) feel like ever since I discovered and utilised my mixed/head voice, it has become more difficult to utilise my falsetto for some reason. From what I've learned, falsetto makes use of the edges of your vocal chords but mixed/head voice stretches the vocal chords to reach into higher ranges. I just feel like the constant stretching of my vocal chords due to mixed/head voice made my falsetto weak for some reason? Like for example, if I am singing in a mixed voice before transitioning into falsetto, I feel like my vocal chords have so much tension and breaks apart, leading to me exerting a lot of effort to continue my falsetto.
