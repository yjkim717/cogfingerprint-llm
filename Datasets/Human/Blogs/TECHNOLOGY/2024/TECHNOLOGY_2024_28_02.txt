Problem: current cs major that just decided i want to do a stats double major, and i need to get lower divs for stats out of the way asap to declare, so i kind of need to start with data 8 and 53 rn. I also need to take all of these for a letter grade for them to count towards my majors. Is this doable and if not any advice of schedule planning? I have 9 classes i need to fit in for stats in the next 5 semesters and 5 for CS + 2 breadths. pls be honest ðŸ˜­
