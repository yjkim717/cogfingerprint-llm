1. If someone has a flight departing at 6am from Ithaca airport, around what time should they arrive? 5am? 2. Also, what are the most reliable taxi services to use that early in the morning? UPDATE: Pre-booked with Collegetown Cabs and had a great experience. Departing from downtown to being at the gate was \~30min (including check-in and security).
