Hey guys, I'm working on a script that watches a folder, then emails users when something changes. The idea is when a pdf is placed in this OnBoarding folder, it tells numerous directors that they need to go look at the pdf and set up the new employee in their various systems. Since I also work at a Medical Facility, security is always a concern. I noticed on the MS Learn page for Send-MailMessage, they have this message displayed: "The `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet is obsolete. This cmdlet doesn't guarantee secure connections to SMTP servers. While there is no immediate replacement available in PowerShell, we recommend you do not use `Send-MailMessage`. For more information, see Platform Compatibility note DE0005." So now I'm curious, if there is no good option from Microsoft, is there some other trusted method which we can use to send emails? Edit: I wasn't expecting this many responses! I had an unrelated webinar class this afternoon, so I haven't replied to most of you, but I will be looking into some of these suggestions and trying to implement one!
