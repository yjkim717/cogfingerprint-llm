Dad's been through the ringer these past two years: lung, throat, and mouth cancer, in addition to having emphysema. He just had massive surgery on his neck and is unable to swallow, so needs a feeding tube. I'm across the country and was recently laid off, so funds are low to visit (plan on visiting in Feb). My mom is a trooper and doing the best she can. There's nothing to say other than how awful and insidious cancer is.
