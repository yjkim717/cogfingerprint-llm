Hi. I fully get why Blausee is as well-known as it is. However, we being in Switzerland, is there another lesser-known lake with as clean blue water and/or scenery as Blausee? Big bonus points if it is also more easily accessible from the ZÃ¼rich area. Recommendations more than appreciated. Thanks!
