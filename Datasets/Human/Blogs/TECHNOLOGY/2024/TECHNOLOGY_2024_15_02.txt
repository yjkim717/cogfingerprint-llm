I'm planning most of my LO around America Rising to get a fun enclave experience. I started a save without PRP because I didn't know if I'd run into issues but the Boston area is ruining my experience and apparently, that's the best bet to fix that area (I already installed a bunch of mods from that midnight site for stability and bug fixing and I've been playing around with bethini but can't get stable 60fps).
