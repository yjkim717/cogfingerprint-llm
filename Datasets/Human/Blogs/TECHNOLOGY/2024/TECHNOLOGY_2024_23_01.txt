Hey everyone I'm not a native english speaker. What does "a good trip around the sun" mean? I searched, but only the meaning of birthday comes up, and it's clearly not that. Even the urban dictionary, my usual go-to, has nothing. Is it a widely used idiom, or Sebas just came up with that referring to, say, changing positions?
