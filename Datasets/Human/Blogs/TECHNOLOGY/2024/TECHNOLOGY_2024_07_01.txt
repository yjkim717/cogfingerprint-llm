Hi, In my sustainable clothing industry there is a lot of brands mostly doing social media ads, social media posts and influencer marketing. What are some good ways to market such a brand aside fom the usual facebook ads? These have taken quite a hit recently and I’m looking to try out some new channels. We have spent over 500k€ (544k$) on our fb ads in the last 3 years but our organic brand search is barely there. It’s literally the same size that some local resellers of aliexpress products have and far from any of our competitors. We have lots of repeated customers but most arrive by our email campaigns. Any ideas? Thank you! Have a nice weekend
