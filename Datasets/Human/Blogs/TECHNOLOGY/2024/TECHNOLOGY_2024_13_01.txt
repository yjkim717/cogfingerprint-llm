I used Pleco to OCR the text, but it might be off. Bakc in 2011 I ate at this place all the time. Pork chops for breakfast, some kind of milk coffee, and little glass jars of Kowloon Dairy milk.... perfect! I suspect it isn't there anymore, but maybe it moved, or renamed? Or maybe someone has a suggestion for a similar style, if you remember this place. Hmm,, the more I look at it the more it looks like it's a chicken place. Maybe I have the wrong restaurant. OK! I found some pics of the interior. I can't read the text, but maybe someone recognizes it.
