We bought this house a year ago and this room in our basement always had a musty smell. After trying a dehumidifier/air purifier with no luck, I finally bit the bullet and took out the drywall below the window since thatâ€™s where I figured there was the highest chance of moisture. This is what was behind the wall. It looks like some sort of patch? Does this mean there was a crack in the foundation that was filled at some point? The previous owners never disclosed this. How serious is it, if at all?
