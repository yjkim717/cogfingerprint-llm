Finally received pricing on my Horizon renewal and it's well within Budget. The switch from Perpetual to SaaS Subscription (Universal) comes out to be almost a $1 cheaper per user per month compared to what it cost a few years ago. Since the Universal License entitles me to vSphere, vSAN, and vCenter, I'm solid moving forward. Count: 600 Term: 3 years ðŸ‘Œ
