I read that adding a small amount of ascorbic acid to the flour will produce a stronger dough but I'm finding that, if anything, it's weaker, at least during the proofing. I bake this recipe without ascorbic acid regularly and it works every time usually. I've made two loaves with ascorbic acid so far. With the first I used half a teaspoon of ascorbic acid. It was somewhat slower to rise after being knocked back and collapsed as I tried to put it in the oven. Looking at what happened I would say it was over proofed but I let it get to the same height in the tin as usual. The resulting bread was a bit on the dense side but quite edible. My better half told me the taste wasn't quite right, maybe a little acidic, I couldn't taste anything different. The crust was noticeably lighter which I assume is the ascorbic acid preventing oxidative browning. For the second loaf I use a quarter of a teaspoon of ascorbic acid. The dough didn't collapse after the second rise but it felt like a close run thing. The bread had the same lighter colour compared to normal. Taste wise, it was possibly the nicest bread I've ever eaten. It was like eating a bread flavored cloud. The crumb was, I would say, slightly springier than usual, is this what the ascorbic acid does? I'll try again with an eighth of a teaspoon but I'm interested in hearing peoples thoughts first. It occurred to me while writing this that I seem to recall noting that the yeast I'm using contains some ascorbic acid already. Naturally the yeast doesn't say how much acid it contains but I can't imagine it's all that much. Recipe * 500g white bread flour * 300g water * 10g salt * 7g fast action yeast * ascorbic acid as detailed * 40min @ 40degC first rise * 50min @ 40 degC second rise * 33min @ 200 degC bake
