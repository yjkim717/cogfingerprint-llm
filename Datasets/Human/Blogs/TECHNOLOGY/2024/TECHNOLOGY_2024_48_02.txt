I've been trying to play on an Intel Mac to varying degrees of success (retuning to gaming PC tonight) and the car's headlights may have been beat up, but I could barely see anything. That seems like too much. I LIKE darkness being a for real problem now, but I shouldn't have to slow to 20 on the main road by Riverside with lights on when it's dark if that's not a just-me and my silly Mac thing. Fully zoomed out (without a boost from settings), I couldn't even see halfway to the edge of the screen. Another issue with darkness is there's no visibility of light switches on facing-away-from-you walls. Just a dim glow less than a foot from the light would be really nice in that regard. Also some institutional buildings could use more main light switches like on the entrance from the parking lot at the Riverside school. Using Riverside HS with the lights off as a gauge, it does feel like it gets pitch black a little too early as you move from the parking lot entrance towards the library.
