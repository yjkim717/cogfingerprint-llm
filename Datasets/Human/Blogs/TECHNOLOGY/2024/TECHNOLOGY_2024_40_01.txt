I currently have an RPi pico that I’ve had sitting around for a while, but I haven’t gotten around to playing with it yet. Since I don’t have any particular projects in mind, I would like a board with a good amount of various little features. Also some built in GPIO headers would be really nice. I’ve accumulated quite a collection of breadboards and various hardware for it over the years from doing arduino. Also I would really like a debug port as well. The big thing I’m looking for though is good library support. So preferably something pretty popular with a good HAL and associated libraries. Not incredibly worried about cost though.
