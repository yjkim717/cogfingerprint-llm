I don't normally like a lot of eurovision music as it tends to always be generic pop which doesn't appeal to me. However Fallen Angel by TIX rings a chord (haha) with me, i don't have tourettes/tics as he does but i have felt isolated/ostrisied at one point or another by my peers and society and i'm also a massive sucker for a power ballad. Although this isn't a traditional power ballad i can just feel in my gut that TIX sang with pure heart and emotion for that song I don't really care that it's 90s boyband cheese on steroids, it rings true to me. That's what music is all about in my eyes I have listened to to in Norweigan and given that i can't speak Norweigan the flow just doesn't seem to work for me, but not saying anyone that prefers it in it's original language is wrong
