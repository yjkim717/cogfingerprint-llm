Suppose everyone used perplexity or some alternate platform, would the "free" web-content that is supported by ad-revenue still be profitable? If not, and everyone is using perplexity-like AI, then there would be no "free" web content, less independent media, etc. The perplexity-like AI will have less content to consume, and it will only come from proprietary (more often biased/centralised) sources. Is anyone working/thinking on this?
