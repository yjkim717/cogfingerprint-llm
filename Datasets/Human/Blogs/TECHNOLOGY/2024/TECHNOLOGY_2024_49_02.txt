My sister's dog likes to play tug-of-war, and he grabs it so aggressively that I can spin him in the air for a while until he lets go. I've done this several times already. He doesn't seem to be in any pain or discomfort and seems to enjoy it like any other form of play. Could this cause any damage to his teeth, body, or anything? I've used 4 toys and they're all designed for dogs, mostly rope-like toys. Thanks. Here's a video:
