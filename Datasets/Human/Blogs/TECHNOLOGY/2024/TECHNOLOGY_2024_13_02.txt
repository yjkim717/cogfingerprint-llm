Hello everyone, I'm thinking of working in HK, but a few jobs I've explored ask if I have HK Residency already. If this is being asked, and I don't, does this basically disqualify me immediately? If the company wants to hire me they would have to go through the entire invitation+visa sponsor process anyway, correct? Or, is this part of the new landscape? - HK residency is required. Thanks! EDIT: If I were to apply for and receive a visa based on the Hong Kong Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, and then moved to HK, thereby getting some kind of Residence Card, would that help an employer decide to hire me, or would it complicate things since I already have one type of visa (QMAS visa - my score is either 105, or 135)?
