Hey Everyone, New Org here, when they hired IT, they had previously brought in an MSP to do all the setup. Those guys operate on some pretty old mindsets about what's best and what's secure. I wouldve went full Entra, but one of our main softwares we use requires SSO with Legacy AD. We've mostly cut ties with that MSP but we do deal with them on some higher level things. The guys who did the set up are long gone and the documentation they have doesn't have any info on the setup. Mostly passwords in ITGlue. They set us up with 90-day PW cycling, as well as Microsoft MFA on the user's smart phone. I would like to move to disabling the PW cycling for security and have users set up a passphrase that's changed rarely, like maybe every 6 months or every year. My problem is, a little while back I looked into some of this and I followed a guide on MS Learn to set up SSPR and eventually I got to a point where Entra told me basically- 'Another policy is conflicting and this can't be set up'. So where I'm at now is I have to go and find whatever the MSP guys set up and turn that off, then set up the SSPR stuff. But I'm not sure where to start to unravel what those guys did or where they set it up ( It has to be coming from somewhere in On-Prem or MS365 Admin Portal ). Anyone have ideas on have to step through and find what they did? I just need advice on how to tackle this. Thanks.
