$95 shipped. Good condition, in generic box, with electrostatic bag and foam. Gently used- I was working on an ITX build last year, picked this up, and it arrived-- surprised to find out that I received a 3x fan, instead of a 2x fan as I thought I ordered. Unnecessarily long cooler for such a card, imho. I made little use out of it since then, and now I've got a proper ITX case to build in, so I won't be needing this any more! Specs: the newegg listing is although it's incorrect it has 2048 stream processors, not as advertised. Timestamps: Comment in thread first, then PM
