I got into them because of Natty. Natty was in Sixteen and she would always beat Momo when they went against each other and I know she couldn’t debut due to her age. I saw that she went solo and gave it a chance, but it wasn’t for me. Then I heard she was gonna be in a group and got excited since she’s a really great dancer and she would be the main dancer and really wanted to support her. I got into them a bit late, but when I did I binged all their stuff I missed and the rest is history.
