I’m looking to humidify a 3x3x6 grow tent and looking at different options. My biggest factor is I don’t want a small reservoir that I have to refill constantly or very often at all. Came across this humidifier from Vevor. Looks very interesting as you can attach it to a 5 gallon water bottle or any soze of reservoir. From doing some digging it seems that the biggest drawback is that it wont go automatically on after power is cut so attaching it to an inkbird doesn’t work. But one comment mentioned he was able to get it working with some soldering. My other concern is its efficiency to create good humidity for mushrooms. I’ve been seeing different things about droplet size vs a fine fog like mist. Hoping someone out there has tried this unit and can give me some insight. I’m just growing oyster for now and debating on buying something like this, or a more expensive AC Affinity or Vivosun unit. Or making my own with a tote and 6 head ultrasonic disc thing. Thanks.
