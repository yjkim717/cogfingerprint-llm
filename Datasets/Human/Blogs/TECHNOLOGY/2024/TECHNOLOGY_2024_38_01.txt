I trying to get into topic modeling. I’m having a lot of trouble with the kind packages made in Python. For instance, when using an LDA for topic modeling I’m having a lot of trouble modifying the function to output metrics as the model is fit iteratively to my dataset. I have tired both Gensim and Sklearn for this and in either case I have to do a lot of potentially problematic workarounds to keep track of these values. In short, what I want in a topic modeling package is the ability to measure convergence and other metrics over iterations, similar to what can easily be done with keras.
