I always come back to this song. The vocals and instruments and tonal quality are amazing and the reverb really stands out. Easily the perfect reverb. Anyone with better ears and reverb knowledge (I know you're out there) than me have any idea how this was achieved? Perhaps a professional hardware unit or a special sound stage or location? Really amazing, thanks for any info you can provide.
