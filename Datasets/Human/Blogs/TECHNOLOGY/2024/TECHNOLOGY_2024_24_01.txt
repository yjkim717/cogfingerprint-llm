Anyone here able to find a way to adapt to the subtick mechanic for flicking? 5k hours of shooting in the middle of my flick in CSGO has really messed up my muscle memory and I'm struggling to adapt to the CS2 mechanic. My flick click timing has never felt so terrible. I've been using 1.8 sens with 400 dpi so it's not that low of a sensitivity, but damn my flicks are really off. Every time I flick, it feels like my shots are always behind the person due to muscle memory. Did a whole week of just aim training to relearn the mechanic but I'm still struggling and it doesn't help that Kovaaks and other external aim trainers don't have subtick which reinforces my click-in-the-middle-of-flick habit in CSGO. I happen to struggle A LOT especially if its a pistol, deagle and awp/scout. My rifle play is still there though. For those that managed to adapt to the new mechanic, what did you guys do? I'm going crazy here knowing I'm genuinely washed ever since picking up CS2. Rant disclaimer: Delaying your click timing in the middle of a flick feels really awkward and I genuinely think I won't ever reach the same skill level pre-subtick
