After beating orange stake, checkered deck just feels so broken. The consistency in flushes from having the suits split half and half makes runs so much easier, especially earlier in a run before you've modified your deck to be more consistent. It honestly felt like a crutch climbing the difficulty ladder because of how much of a difference it makes. Have other people felt the same way?
