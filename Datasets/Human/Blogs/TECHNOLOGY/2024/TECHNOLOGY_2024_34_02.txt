Wife and I have 3 little kids so we very *rarely* get out We typically just do dinner (La Fogata, Paloma.l Blanca, etc.) or see a movie. Got a sitter lined up for next week since it's our anniversary, looking for some good ideas. We live in far north stone oak, essentially close to Bulverde. Why y'all downvoting this? Smh
