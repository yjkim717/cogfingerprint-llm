Saw this question earlier today and it made me think, what is the most cost effective way? Let's say I have 1 BTC (I don't), And my local currency is GBP. 1 bitcoin currently stands at around Â£56.6k If you wanted to withdraw everything, how would you handle a transaction like that? I never really thought about it too much, but now that I do I realise it's important for a process like this to be simple and without ridiculous feed if BTC is to be globally adopted.
