Currently i have an oracle vps running ubuntu 22.04 that i plan to use for vpn and proxying. I currently have certbot and nginx (used for routing traffic and for general reverse proxy uses) installed via snap and apt respectively. So currently im trying to use a duckdns domain as it is free. ive been struggling to get a wildcard letsencrypt cert using certbot and I can't tell whether or not the issue is with me being bad or duckdns is having a stroke. Certbot is installed via snap, along with the duckdns plugin and linking it to the main certbot package. the command ive been using is \`sudo certbot certonly --dry-run --non-interactive --agree-tos --email email --preferred-challenges dns --server --authenticator dns-duckdns --dns-duckdns-credentials $HOME/secrets/duckdns.ini --dns-duckdns-propagation-seconds 120 -d "stoopidman.duckdns.org" -d "\*.stoopidman.duckdns.org"\` (stoopidman is the subdomain ive set in duckdns information redacted as needed) for now im just doing the staging cert dry runs to see if it even works. I get different errors when i run this command. at first i would get dns txt record servfails or an error saying that the wrong txt record was found at "\_acme-challenge.stoopidman.duckdns.org" and was unauthorized, despite my token being correct. i tried setting a manual txt record through duckdns's api (using the token in my ini file) and \`dig\`ging for the txt record, which worked.
