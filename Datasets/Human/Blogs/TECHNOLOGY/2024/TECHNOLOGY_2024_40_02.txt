I can’t find anything online about this aside from a bugzilla tracker saying the status of “Introduce WebBluetooth Support” is “RESOLVED WONTFIX” which is pretty discouraging. Is it just simply too complicated of a stack to implement and isn’t worth the effort? Or is there some more concrete reason why?
