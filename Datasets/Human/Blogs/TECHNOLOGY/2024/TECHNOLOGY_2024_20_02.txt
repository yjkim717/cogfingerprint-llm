I planted all 20 of my starters and they’re not doing well. I have 2 4’x2’x10” beds that were filled with just raised bed soil (I know I know I’m so dumb) and 2 others filled with garden mix worm castings, yard clippings and compost (these are doing well & keeping moisture!). The ones with just raised bed soil are drying out SO FAST and you can see a separation between the soil and the wood because of how dry and solid it is getting. I need to amend this soil but I’m new to planting and don’t know how to safely do it without killing my plants. So far I am watering as much as I can feel it needs every night after sundown.
