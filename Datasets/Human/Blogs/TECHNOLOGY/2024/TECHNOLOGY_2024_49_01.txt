I just spent the whole day on LeetCode problems and it’s not the first time. I lose track of time and next thing I know it’s the end of the day. Today I spent over 3 hours on yesterday’s Daily problem and almost got to a solution. Then today’s problem which frustrated me until I saw the editorial. Is there any point in spending so much time and energy on this? I feel satisfied that I broke down the first problem and almost got the solution after 3 hours but I feel unproductive and frustrated.
