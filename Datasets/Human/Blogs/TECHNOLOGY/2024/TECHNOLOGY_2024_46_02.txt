I'm purchasing a digital tabletop for roleplaying games, and have a question regarding touch screen monitors. My goal is to have a digital surface that we can use for RPG mapping with both digital icons that players will move by hand (well, fingers), and with physical miniatures. The idea is that, as we're playing the game, I'll be moving icons either remotely (via tablet and/or laptop) and/or physically, by touching and dragging them on the screen. Aside from that, one of my players brought up a "pie in the sky" idea of using some kind of sensor tags attached to the bottom of the miniatures, so that when you pick up the physical miniature and move it to another location on the monitor (which will be laying flat, of course; the screen will be the surface), the monitor will be able to sense where it has been moved to and the display will update accordingly. I'm not a hardware guy, though, and I'm definitely not a TV guy, so I'm not certain if such technology exists. With the little bit I know, I'm wondering just how small of an RFID chip I could find and glue or tape to the bottom of the minis (anything larger/thicker than a postage stamp would likely be too big), and I don't even know if such technology exists. Any thoughts?
