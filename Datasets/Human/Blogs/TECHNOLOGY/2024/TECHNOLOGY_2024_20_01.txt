I’m halfway through the 2nd season. I’m making a quick assumption because it’s so often, but Amerie is constantly belittled or hated on for trying to speak up about her feelings, and she ALWAYS has severe drama. This season, Malakai literally iced her out because she thought he was queer and felt like she was left out of the equation, he called her selfish but who wouldn’t feel like Amerie did? He literally left her to be with Rowan. Last season, Harper pretty much shit on her every chance she got because she didn’t open the door (she had her own shit going on!!). I don’t get it. Why does Amerie keep getting beat up in the seasons? They don’t let my girl rest.
