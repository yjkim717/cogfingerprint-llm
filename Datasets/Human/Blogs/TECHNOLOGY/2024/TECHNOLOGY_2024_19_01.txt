Should clarify therapy is helping with lots of other things but my almost complete detachment from sex isnt one of them. Im a 31M I tend to go from being able to tolerate that i need it, to wanting to get rid of it at all costs. I know im not asexual because i do have sexual desire but its always about other people because ironically thats "safer" than my partner I can put up a persona if needed; actually i did that for around 9 years till i entred therapy (of my own valition) I often catch myself pondering whats the point of sex because it doesnt do anything for me, i get much more out of sexting or writing erotica Not even orgasming does much (if i orgasm at all). Yes i do watch porn but again ill sometimes go months without watching because i often find myself wondering about why i need it often telling myself there are more important things i need to be doing like guitar practise or putting things in my calendar so i dont forget
