My STEM OPT expires on May 31st and I'm planning to transfer my SEVIS to a new university shortly after. A while back, HR told me that they could keep me in the company for longer (no pay and no work hours) to see if there would be a second H1B lottery round, but it was discussed in regards to me leaving the country. Ideally, I'd like to be formally employed, even with no salary, due to the possibility of 2nd H1B round and also to accumulate more employment days, which could help with immigration to Canada. However, I'm not sure if it would be legally possible for me to have formal employment (with no salary and work hours) with my company after my STEM OPT expires. Does anyone know if I could stay in my company in this status for a few months after my STEM OPT or if I have to leave immediately?
