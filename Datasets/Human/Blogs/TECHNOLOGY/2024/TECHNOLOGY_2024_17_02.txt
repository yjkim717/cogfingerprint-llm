I've got myself a shiny new VPS to play with and I'd like to run a couple of WordPress sites. I've got the machine to the point where it's installed and secure (I've taken this opportunity to learn nftables, what a step up from iptables). The problem is I can't decide what route to take for the rest of the setup. **Route 1:** I was planning on installing Docker and then running containers for Nginx, MariaDB, and WordPress (and maybe Portainer). This is what I do in my home lab and it works fine. I configured it like that in my home lab because I already had a virtual machine running Docker. WordPress would be kept up to date by tracking the latest container and auto-updating plugins. **Route 2:** Install everything directly on the server. Nginx and MariaDB would come from the Debian repos. In the past this is what I'd have done but I've found myself drifting away from running services like this directly on the machine. WordPress would be kept up to date by the usual method of logging in and updating (and auto-updating plugins). **Route 3:** This is like the choose your own adventure part... how would you do it? Would you run a control panel? I've been considering running CloudPanel but I'm honestly not sure what it would really do for me that I don't already do from the command line. I'm not completely new to running a server but every time I build a new one I want to do better than the time before and keep up with best practice.
