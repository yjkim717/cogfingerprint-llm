I've had mine since November and usually get at least 24 hrs. A few days ago it completely changed and randomly starts draining FAST. For example, I had it 100 charged last night and woke up to 16% left. It's on bedtime mode at night so AOD settings shouldn't even impact the battery on that case. I've restarted it z couple times but no idea what to do now?
