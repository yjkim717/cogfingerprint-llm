Anyone have tips on how to conceal carry in the summer in shorts without a belt/belt loop? I've tried ones with a decent drawstring but the holster usually comes out when I draw..so not ideal. I've tried a belt that doesn't need loops but it was uncomfortable, and I haven't found a proper belly band that accommodates my optic and feels secure.
