Hi /r/copenhagen > In my opinion, one of the best places to buy a cheap used bike from is a community or charity bike shop (â€¦) where they take old bikes, refurbish them and then sell them Is there something like this in Copenhagen? (Simple non-electric, non-cargo bikes.) The Red Cross does something like this with donated bikes, but if I remember correctly, you have to be a refugee to be able to buy them. Buddha Bikes seems to be doing exactly that, but at 2000 - 6000 kr they're expensive.
