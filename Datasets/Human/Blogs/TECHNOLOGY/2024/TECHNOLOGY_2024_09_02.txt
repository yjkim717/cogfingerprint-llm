Poach: Could’ve made it farther with Andbox but something happened with the team. Did decent with BBG and had a short time on FaZe. Was a coach for DSG for a bit, now a streamer. Zexrow: Didn’t really have a good run, but did decent. Had a short time on Tier 2 and is now streaming on and off Deadlock. Psalm: Didn’t really have success, only being subs for teams like Digntas and The Guard. Now just streaming Deadlock. Thwifo: Started out somewhat successful getting to teams such as XSET, T1, BBG and subs for 100T and NRG for a bit. Now he’s just doing whatever now. Kinda disappointing to see them not really doing much with Valorant. I think Thwifo and Poach could’ve made it, but I guess nothing stuck to them for playing pro Valorant anymore. The others probably expected too much and thought they could be successful since they made it on Fortnite.
