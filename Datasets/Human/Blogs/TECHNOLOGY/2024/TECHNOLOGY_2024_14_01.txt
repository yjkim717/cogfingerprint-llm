I called it 3 years ago when character coopting and rewrites started being made obvious, and further yet 1 year ago about the cause of Helena's death and her modern era story being sloppy. Granted the series was written during the era of movies and shows focusing way too much on being inclusive, it comes as no surprise that the series missed the mark. Rushed story with no chemistry between the characters and not focusing on things that made Ark such a compelling story is a huge miss on their part. Sadly, my prediction about the quality of the story is continually being proven right, and that in my previous thread, it doesn't seem like they plan to go as far as Earth/Extinction considering how heavily some of the characters are rewritten and/or neglected.
